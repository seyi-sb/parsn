He even delayed the ban a couple more times to give ByteDance more time to sell its US business. Trump previously claimed that a \"very wealthy\" group is poised to buy TikTok, but the administration has yet to reveal the identities of the people in it. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/the-white-house-now-has-a-tiktok-account-032420845.html?src=rss",

The current deadline for a deal […]",
    "full_text": "The current deadline for a deal is September 17th. Still, it hasn’t stopped Trump’s administration from creating @WhiteHouse on TikTok, which published its first post on Tuesday night: a video celebrating Trump’s accomplishments. The ban has only seen TikTok shut down in the US for one day, and its impact has been delayed three times. The first time was in January, when Trump took office and signed an executive order delaying enforcement of the ban for 75 days; then there was another delay in April, after a potential deal fell through due to Trump’s harsh tariffs against China, and then in June, when he stated that he believed Chinese President Xi Jinping was open to a deal if a buyer emerged. A Republican digital operative close to the campaign heavily credited Trump, a former reality TV star, for his ability to generate attention-grabbing moments that could be transformed into viral content. “TikTok is primarily an entertainment app,” he previously told The Verge, “and our usage of it was just significantly more savvy than [the Democrats].” Although the legality of and ulterior motives behind a TikTok ban remain a serious question, the Trump administration, for now, appears to find utility in maintaining an account on the platform. “Why would I want to get rid of TikTok?” Trump said on Truth Social in January, sharing a post about the billions of views his campaign account continued to rack up. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt repeated this stance after the government account was launched. “President Trump’s message dominated TikTok during his presidential campaign,” she said in a statement to The Verge, “and we’re excited to build upon those successes and communicate in a way no other administration has before.”"

    "summary": "\nThe wait for accessing iOS 26 and iPadOS 26 is getting shorter as the Apple iPhone event inches closer. The OS 26es are bringing huge upgrades to your iPhone and iPad's operating systems. One you've probably heard us talk about numerous times is the visual update: Liquid Glass. (It's like the better-executed version of Windows Vista.) We spent two weeks test-driving it — you can check out our detailed hands-on iOS 26 preview, or you can try it out yourself by downloading and installing the public beta 2. That software is a more stable iteration of the separate developer version, which recently hit the beta 7 waypoint, and offers a few more flashy features not yet available in the public version. (While the public beta is open to everyone and quite stable, always remember there's a degree of risk involved with beta software.) Additionally, there are credible reports that iOS 26 could bring a new live translation feature to AirPods, too. Not sure if you want to upgrade your smartphone or tablet this year? No worries, we'll help you find out if your devices will be able to run iOS 26.\nWhile Apple didn't nix any iPhones from its eligibility list last year, that's not the case for 2025 — a few models are getting cut this time. All iPhone 8 models and the iPhone X were the last to get the boot in 2023, and this year the 2018 models are getting left behind. If you have an ineligible device, you won't be able to download iOS 26 when it becomes available this fall. \nWe'll get to the bottom of which iPhones and iPads will support iOS 26 and iPadOS 26 this year. To see what's coming with the latest OSes, check out everything announced at Apple's WWDC June 9 event. One thing you shouldn't immediately expect is Apple's updated version of Siri, though the company is reportedly working on a 'stripped-down' AI chatbot to compete with ChatGPT. \nThese three iPhones won't be compatible with iOS 26\nUnlike last year, several iPhone models won't be eligible to download the newest iOS when it makes its debut this fall. This trio of models first released in 2018 won't be coming to the iOS 26 party:\n\niPhone XR\niPhone XS\niPhone XS Max\n\niPhones compatible with iOS 26\nWhile we don't yet know the new iPhones Apple will be dropping this fall — though there are iPhone 17 rumors — we do know, per Apple's site, that the phones listed below will be compatible with iOS 26. Basically, if you have an iPhone that was announced in 2019 or later, you're in the clear:\n\niPhone SE (second generation or later)\niPhone 11\niPhone 11 Pro\niPhone 11 Pro Max\niPhone 12\niPhone 12 mini\niPhone 12 Pro\niPhone 12 Pro Max\niPhone 13\niPhone 13 mini\niPhone 13 Pro\niPhone 13 Pro Max\niPhone 14\niPhone 14 Plus\niPhone 14 Pro\niPhone 14 Pro Max\niPhone 15\niPhone 15 Plus\niPhone 15 Pro\niPhone 15 Pro Max\niPhone 16\niPhone 16 Plus\niPhone 16 Pro\niPhone 16 Pro Max\niPhone 16e\n\niPads compatible with iPadOS 26\nThe iPads listed below, and any iPads released later this year, are eligible to download iPadOS 26.\n\niPad Pro (M4)\niPad Pro 12.9‑inch (3rd generation and later)\niPad Pro 11‑inch (1st generation and later)\niPad Air (3rd generation and later, including M2 and M3)\niPad (8th generation and later, including A16)\niPad mini (5th generation and later, including A17 Pro)\n\nWhat if I don't want to buy a new iPhone?\nIf you want to continue using your older iPhone that isn't supported by iOS 26, that's fine. However, you'll miss out on security updates which could potentially put your phone at risk for malware and other threats. Additionally, some apps may stop working if they require a certain version of iOS or later. And of course, you won't be able to access the latest features iOS 26 offers.\nWhen will iOS 26 become available?\nApple usually rolls out its latest iOS in mid-September, just a few days before the new iPhones hit store shelves. Last year, it released iOS 18 on Monday, Sept. 16. Expect a confirmation of the release date at the iPhone 17 event, expected in early September. \niOS 26 features we're excited about\nLiquid Glass design: Your home screen is getting revamped with new app icons, including dark mode and all-clear options. You'll also notice buttons with a new floating design. Liquid Glass was designed to make all of Apple's OSes more cohesive.\nPhone app redesign: You'll finally be able to scroll through contacts, recent calls and voicemail messages all on one screen. It also comes with a new feature called Hold Assist that'll notify you when an agent comes to the phone so you can avoid the elevator music.\nLive Translate: iOS 26 is bringing the ability to have a conversation via phone call or text message with someone who speaks another language. Live Translate will translate your conversation in real time. \nPolls feature: Coming to group messages in the Messages app, chat members will be able to create polls. This can help prevent the unwanted 30+ messages when it comes to deciding which restaurant you're meeting at this weekend.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/apples-new-ios-26-beta-2-has-new-features-but-is-your-iphone-compatible-check-this-list-191854362.html?src=rss",

A Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted Aug. 13-18 and released Tuesday dug into some of those specific concerns. Don't miss any of CNET's unbiased tech content and lab-based reviews. But even larger portions of the American public are worried about more immediate issues. AI developers and business leaders tout the technology's ability to make workers more efficient. But other polls have also shown how common fears of job loss are. Two-thirds of respondents in the poll said they were concerned about AI's use as a replacement for in-person relationships. This is widespread enough that OpenAI, when it rolled out the new GPT-5 model this month, had to bring back an older model that had a more conversational tone because users felt like they'd lost a friend. Even OpenAI CEO Sam Altman acknowledged that users treating AI as a kind of therapist or life coach made him \"uneasy.\" The data centers that house these computers are like giant AI factories, and they're taking up space, electricity and water in a growing number of places."

But with all of those options, which one should you pick? Now, let’s get to the deals. It weighs half as much as the Ultra, too, and is about 30 percent thinner despite its 42mm and 46mm sizing. Other upgrades include an added depth and water temperature sensor, as well as a new FDA-cleared sleep apnea detection feature, the latter of which is also available on the last-gen Series 9 and Ultra 2. The Apple Watch SE received a refresh in late 2022. Those omissions might take this out of the running for some people, but it still may be exactly what you’re after. Best of all, it starts at $249 for the 40mm Wi-Fi / GPS model, which is $30 less than the previous generation’s baseline cost. While all of the Apple Watch models and colorways covered here are encased in aluminum (except the Ultra 2, which has a titanium build), Apple does make a more premium range built out of stainless steel and titanium.

    "full_text": "Among the biggest concerns of parents whose kids own a smartphone must surely be the knowledge that there's a whole bunch of nude content out there on the internet for them to stumble across. Likely more worrying still is the thought that their precious offspring may be tempted to make such content themselves. Finnish phone-maker HMD has been on a mission for the past few years to make phone ownership a safer prospect for children via its Better Phones Project -- and it might have come up with a solution to calm the nerves of concerned parents. On Wednesday, the company unveiled the HMD Fuse phone, which comes with built-in AI-powered technology to prevent children from filming and sending nude content, as well as from seeing and saving sexual images -- even from within a livestream. The AI (called HarmBlock Plus) was created by cybersecurity SafeToNet and is embedded into the phone (including the camera), which, according to HMD, makes it impossible to bypass. It's apparently been ethically trained on 22 million harmful nude images and works offline. \"It doesn't collect personal data. Parental controls, similar to those available on the Fusion X1, which HMD introduced at MWC in March, will also allow for supervision and management of a child's phone use. This can be scaled back as a kid grows older and requires more independence. It will cost £33 per month, with a £30 up-front fee and is set to launch in other countries in the coming months, starting with Australia."

Purple, blue and green are all part of the same color palette. The neutral colors don't quite surprise me since they're standard for iPhones at this point. Leaker Scott Dickson also noted the orange shade may end up being a dark gold or copper, but no other rumors point to that new color yet. Perhaps because the latest M4 MacBook Air currently comes in sky blue, an iPhone in the same color could be an aesthetic win for sky blue MacBook owners. It seems like there's a possibility for different shades of blue, as we see in the lineup above. Bu posted on X and their blog on June 20 that Apple is testing purple and green, but that purple could be another new color for the iPhone 17's base models.

AI agents are digital helpers that go beyond traditional chatbots to understand context and assist in reaching your goals. The update introduces nine agents that move Grammarly into a more collaborative role. Instead of just correcting grammar or suggesting phrasing, the agents are intended to actively work alongside users. The company cites research showing that while only a small share of students feel confident using AI in professional settings (18%), most employers expect AI literacy from job candidates. By emphasizing skill-building and responsible use, Grammarly says it wants to bridge that gap rather than simply automate assignments. \"We're moving beyond simple suggestions to intelligent agents that understand context and actively help users achieve their communication goals.\" And the Expert Review tool provides industry-specific feedback without requiring specialized prompts. Some users on social media welcomed the update as a way to cut through the anxiety of essay writing, while others questioned whether it might make students too dependent on machine feedback."

Sling introduced a fresh package called Sling Select on Tuesday, joining its prior offerings of Sling Orange, Sling Blue and Sling Orange & Blue plans. Select's selection is a pared-down version of Blue (plus some outliers not found in Blue or Orange), and its price reflects that. You can also add \"extra packs\" with additional channels for an additional cost. Select will also offer locals depending on where you live, but prepare to pay more if you want access to one or more of the Fox, NBC and ABC trio. If you're in a market with one or two local channels -- such as Atlanta or Houston -- you will pay an extra $5 per month, and if you're in a market with all three -- such as Los Angeles or New York -- you'll pay an extra $10. Blue costs $46 and $51 per month (locals can impact the price); Some channels you get with Blue but not Select are A&E, AMC, Bravo, CNN, Comedy Central, Food Network, HGTV, Lifetime and TLC. Sling, which unveiled live TV streaming Day and Weekend Passes for short-term viewers last week, said in a blog post that the new Select Package supports its aim of giving customers flexibility. Select arrives at a time when plenty of lower-priced live TV streamers and packages are jostling for people's eyes, including Frndly ($11 for HD streaming), Philo ($28) and DirecTV Genre Packs ($20 and up). The channel selections are more meager than those of YouTube TV, but they fill a niche for customers who want to pay less for specific lineups."

NASA announced on Tuesday that the James Webb Space Telescope found yet another moon floating around Uranus, an ice giant that already had 13 other known moons. A team from the Southwest Research Institute noticed an unfamiliar object that appeared to be orbiting Uranus. \"This object was spotted in a series of 10 40-minute long-exposure images captured by the Near-Infrared Camera,\" said lead scientist Maryame El Moutamid. \"It's a small moon but a significant discovery, which is something even NASA's Voyager 2 spacecraft didn't see during its flyby nearly 40 years ago.\" Uranus' 14th moon orbits closer to its rings than most of the other moons. However, Uranus is the king of tiny moons. Since S/2025 U1 is so much smaller than the known moons, Tiscareno posits that there may be even more small moons drifting around that have yet to be discovered. NASA does note that this research hasn't been peer-reviewed yet, so the for-now clunkily named S/2025 U1 may still be dismissed as a non-moon. However, if it is confirmed, the moon will receive a better (we hope) name from the International Astronomical Union and become completely official."

    "full_text": "Google is one step closer to reaching its nuclear ambitions now that it’s working with public power utility Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) to purchase electricity from a next-generation reactor. The plan is for TVA to buy electricity from a reactor being developed by engineering company Kairos Power in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. If they manage to pull this all off, it could help jumpstart a whole new era for nuclear energy If they manage to pull this all off, it could help jumpstart a whole new era for nuclear energy in the US. The announcement follows news that Google would purchase electricity from “multiple” small modular reactors designed by Kairos Power. Eventually, Google aims to help Kairos deploy 500 megawatts of new nuclear capacity in the US by 2035. Google will receive clean energy attributes from the Hermes 2 plant through TVA. By matching its electricity use with those certificates, a company might claim that it runs on clean energy even if it’s plugged into a power grid that still runs on dirty energy. Extra income from clean energy attributes is supposed to help developers add more carbon pollution-free power to the grid (although research has shown that the environmental benefits are often overestimated). Google’s carbon emissions rose again last year as it ramps up its AI offerings."

    "full_text": "Apple will not be required to provide an encryption backdoor in the UK, easing concerns about weakened privacy and security safeguards. The announcement was made by US Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard on social media late Monday evening. Gabbard said Americans' private data will be protected after an agreement was finally reached with the UK following prolonged behind-the-scenes maneuvering. The company has regularly resisted government requests that it create a backdoor for law enforcement. Originally, the UK demanded that Apple provide a way for the government to access data from iCloud accounts of both British citizens and citizens of other countries to assist in criminal investigations. Privacy advocates had been deeply critical of the UK's now-scuttled request as a case of government overreach and a potential foothold for mass surveillance. \"The reality is that a backdoor designed for 'good actors' cannot be kept exclusive,\" said Adam Boynton, a senior security strategy manager at the software company Jamf. Backdoors can also erode public trust in platforms such as Apple's that people use daily, Boynton said. \"The legislation requiring the backdoor to encryption remains, and until this is removed there is a danger that other companies or Apple may be asked at another time to provide a backdoor,\" said Tony Anscombe, a UK-based chief security evangelist at the cybersecurity company ESET. A lack of transparency by the government, he said, \"raises the question of how many other companies have been provided a notice and complied or are in dispute.\""

Watch this: Everything Announced at Gamescom Opening Night Live 2025 in 20 Minutes 20:05 We got our first long look at the story, which mixes cerebral mindscapes with your typical fast-paced Call of Duty combat. The anime will debut on Crunchyroll at an unstated date. Chinese developer Game Science wowed the games world with Black Myth Wukong, and Gamescom 2025 featured the reveal trailer of the next game in its series, Black Myth: Zhong Kui, which will be another action-adventure game based on Chinese myth -- in this case, the ghost-catching god Zhong Kui. It's been nearly 20 years since the last new Onimusha game came out, and now we've got another look at Onimusha: Way of the Sword -- which looks to preserve the originals' sword-and-parry combat with other magical weapons. Demons, bosses and brutal executions abound in the Onimusha trailer. The next trailer for Ninja Gaiden 4 includes looks at boss fights, including giant robots and futuristic samurai with stylized armor. Another trailer from the upcoming sequel to Ghost of Tsushima has dropped, showing more gameplay, from traversal across beautiful lands to swordfights in the snow."

    "full_text": "Meta's AI team just rolled out new translation tools to Facebook and Instagram, allowing user-generated content to be converted into other languages on the fly. These new tools, which were announced at Meta Connect in 2024, are intended to help bridge the gap between people who speak different languages so that videos and reels can be understood by more audiences internationally. Currently, the one-click translations effectively translate English reels into Spanish (or vice versa). Though other languages will be added at a later date, they aren't completely left out for now. A Facebook-only feature lets creators add multiple audio reels to a single video, allowing it to be accessed in as many languages as the uploader provides tracks for. It's unknown whether this feature will come to Instagram at a later date. Additionally, uploaders can opt into an AI lip-sync feature that works in tandem with the translations to create what Meta says are seamless mouth movements in AI-edited videos. The AI lip-sync feature can be turned off using creator controls at any time, which is helpful for anyone nervous about AI-generated visual elements in their content. A new metric in the Insights tab will let creators sort their view count by language, presumably to prove the effectiveness of these AI translations. During the 2025 Google I/O presentation, an on-stage demonstration of Gemini integration for smart glasses showed off what an AI-assisted real-time conversation between people who speak different languages could look like in the near future."

It's possible that Black Ops 7 brings robot operators back to the series' multiplayer modes. If you want to jump into the Black Ops 7 closed beta and try the game before anyone else, you'll need to shell out some cash. Usually, people who preorder the game get special access to the closed beta -- this is still true with Call of Duty Black Ops 7. Classic Black Ops 2 scorestreaks could make a return in the next Call of Duty game. Black Ops 7's open beta begins on Oct. 5. The open beta period will allow any interested gamer to try out Black Ops 7 on their console of choice. While no official release date has been revealed, leaks point to a mid-November launch."

The ruling keeps unfair labor practice cases against SpaceX and two other companies, Energy Transfer and Findhelp, on hold while the companies pursue their claim that the NLRB structure violates the U.S. Constitution. While the court did declare it unlawful, this is far from a settled issue and the NLRB is undoubtedly likely to challenge the ruling. The three-judge panel said being subjected to a possibly unconstitutional administrative proceeding, which is what SpaceX claimed, is an irreparable harm — so the pause continues. The NLRB brought the unfair labor practices claim against SpaceX after it fired a group of employees who signed an open letter criticizing CEO Elon Musk and a culture of sexism in the company. The core of the dispute is over whether the NLRB’s in-house judges, called administrative law judges, enjoy unlawful protections that shield them from removal by the president. If that’s the case, it violates constitutional rules governing the separation of powers, the judges said. The panel included two judges appointed by President Donald Trump and a third judge appointed by George H.W.

It features an M3 chip with support for Apple Intelligence, plus compatibility with Apple’s latest Magic Keyboard that has a larger trackpad and an extra row of function keys. Right now, for instance, the 11-inch Air is on sale at Amazon and Walmart in its base configuration with Wi-Fi and 128GB of storage starting at $536.82 (about $63 off). They also feature repositioned front-facing cameras that sit along the horizontal edge (also found in the 11th-gen iPad), which prevent you from looking as though you’re staring off into space on a video call. Amazon also has the 1TB model for $1,699 ($200 off) if you’re looking for more storage to hold your apps, photos, and videos.

    "full_text": "Any video game fan who's dedicated hours to playing Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice can now dedicate even more hours to watching its upcoming anime adaptation. Sekiro: No Defeat will arrive as a new streaming TV series on Crunchyroll in 2026, the anime giant announced Tuesday at Gamescom. Developed by FromSoftware, the critically acclaimed action game is set during Japan's Sengoku period and lets players assume the role of Wolf -- also known as Senkiro -- a shinobi charged with protecting a lord with divine lineage. Crunchyroll partnered with Kadokawa, Qzil.la and Arch to bring to life the anime version that will see Daisuke Namikawa voice Wolf, Miyuki Satou as Kuro and Kenjiro Tsudawhich voicing Genichiro Ashina. In doing so, we are pouring every ounce of our artistic vision and passion for beauty into its production,\" said Kutsuna. \"The final product is being crafted to be a truly memorable experience, one that will leave a lasting impression on both dedicated fans of the game and those who are discovering the world of Sekiro for the very first time. The story follows a young orphan Wolf, who is trained under Owl, a nomadic ninja who appoints him as Kuro's protector. During an attempt to flee, Wolf loses an arm in a fight against their main adversary, Genichiro. Throughout the fantasy adventure story, he gains a new name (Sekiro) and fights for honor, loyalty and his lord's fate. Newcomers unfamiliar with the tale of Sekiro can count on seeing masterful katana skills, action-packed combat scenes and magic when Sekiro: No Defeat hits screens next year."

    "summary": "Absolum, the fantasy beat-'em-up from the team behind Streets of Rage 4, will arrive on October 9, Dotemu shared today. Ahead of the announcement, the publisher hosted a new preview of the game, giving the gaming press a chance to check out a new playable character and zone (more on those in a moment).\nI didn't get a chance to play Absolum when it was first announced back in March, so going into this latest demo I didn't know what to expect. Now, after playing Absolum through most of the weekend, I can't wait for the final version in October. In fact, I think it might end up being a surprise game of the year contender for a lot of people. I've never been a fan of beat-'em-ups; most haven't had enough depth to keep me interested. Absolum solves that issue by smartly borrowing from modern roguelikes, with Supergiant's Hades standing as an obvious influence.\nEach run in Absolum starts with you selecting a \"Ritual\" for your character. Like Boons in Hades, these modify your character's abilities with special properties. For example, one Ritual I encountered in my second playthrough caused throwable rose daggers to spawn whenever I timed a dodge perfectly. In turn, these allowed me to quickly dispatch dangerous enemies at a distance. The further into a run you get, the more likely you are to encounter additional Rituals. And, once again borrowing from Hades and its idea of Duo Boons, some Rituals are designed to synergize with one another. Combined with the game's Arcana system, which allows you to select up to two special attacks for your character, there's great combat variety in Absolum.\nDotemu\nIn fact, it never feels like you're simply button mashing. Combat is very Souls-like in that there are many different enemies for the player to take on, and each one requires its own approach. What's more, dodging attacks is often more important than dishing out damage. Healing items in Absolum are few and far between, but to balance this, the game gives you a few different ways to avoid getting hurt. You can either side step away from an attack, dash directly into an enemy to block them or use your character's Skill attack to perform what the game calls a \"Clash.\" If timed correctly, all three options allow you to punish an enemy for trying to get the jump on you. Of the three, however, Clashes — acting as Absolum's version of a parry — are the hardest to pull off, but can turn a boss fight in your favor, allowing you to deflect an attack that would have otherwise been devastating.\nWith this preview, Dotemu let everyone try the game's full roster of four characters. Over the five hours I played the demo, I had the most fun with Galandra, a necromantic warrior with a sword on her back that would be big enough even for Guts. Each character feels distinct from their counterparts. Brome, for instance, who wasn't in the recent Steam Next Fest demo Dotemu released, is the game's only mage-like character. His playstyle centers around zoning your enemies with beams of power. Oh, and did I mention that he's a frog? Meanwhile, the new zone, Jaroba, did a great job of mixing things up just as I was getting used to ebb and flow of Absolum's combat. Enemies here employ much more devious attacks that are harder to dodge and counter.   \nIf rougelike fans didn't have Hades 2 to look forward to this year, I think Absolum would easily be in the running for one of the best indie releases of 2025. As it stands, the game has tough competition, but if you're a fan of challenging and mechanically complex but fun combat systems, I think you owe it to yourself to check out Absolum come October when it arrives on Steam, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and PS5. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/absolum-is-awesome-and-i-cant-wait-to-play-it-on-october-9-180037272.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "In the 16 years since Ronald D. Moore's take on Battlestar Galactica ended its official TV run in 2009, the most surprising thing about the series is that it hasn't inspired many great games. Sure, more than a few releases have carried the Battlestar Galactica name, but none of those have managed to capture what made the 2003 miniseries and later 2004 show so special. That might change early next year when Battlestar Galactica: Scattered Hopes arrives.\nAhead of today's announcement of the game, publisher Dotemu gave the gaming press a chance to play an early build of Scattered Hopes. The first thing you need to know about the game is that it's made by Alt Shift, the studio behind 2019's Crying Suns. Alt Shift doesn't shy away from the fact Crying Suns was inspired by Battlestar Galactica, and the studio's love for the source material shows in its new project. Even in the version I played, which was missing gameplay features and had yet to be properly balanced, Scattered Hopes feels like BSG's three-hour pilot episode recreated in game form.\nAlt Shift / Dotemu\nIn Scattered Hopes, you're tasked with leading a fleet of ships fleeing the destruction of Caprica. Like Crying Suns, the game is a roguelike, meaning gameplay revolves around randomized runs and you're expected to fail your mission multiple times before you get anywhere close to success. At the start of each run, you pick a fleet, with each one offering a different mix of military and civilian ships for you to command. Once you're underway, gameplay is a mix of turn-based and real-time strategy as your fleet jumps from system to system to try and outrun the Cylons.\nWhen you first arrive in a sector, you have a handful of turns to carry out scavenging missions, repairs to your fleet and research that will enhance your combat abilities. During this time, situations can develop among the survivors of the Twelve Colonies. For example, on my first run, a group of thieves started stealing supplies from the fleet. What's interesting about these scenarios is that you'll frequently be forced to choose between different factions among your survivors, representing the interests of workers, military personnel and other more shady elements. Often, these groups will come forward on their own to offer you something, but those gifts never come free, and you need to balance the influence of each group, lest one become too powerful. \nAlt Shift / Dotemu\nAfter a few turns of this, the Cylons will arrive and will always do so with overwhelming force. These battles play out in real-time, though there's a tactical pause in case things get too hectic. At the start of my first run, I only had one Battlestar and two fighter squadrons to fight off everything that came my way. \nThe goal of these encounters is not to defeat the Cylons, but rather to stay alive as long as it takes for the faster than light drives on your ships to spin up. These battles are the most fun part of the experience. They're absolutely hectic, and I found making it out with minimal damage to my fleet required prioritizing the right targets. That's easier said than done. The Cylons often sent a homing missile or tactical nuke my way that forced me to redirect my fighter squadrons to intercept those, leaving the rest of my fleet vulnerable.  \nEven in its early state, with seemingly a lot of work left for Alt Shift to do before the game ships early next year, Scattered Hopes is an incredibly fun exercise in crisis management, and I'm hopeful the studio can stick the landing. In the meantime, you can wish list the game on Steam.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/battlestar-galactica-might-finally-get-the-video-game-adaption-it-deserves-180032698.html?src=rss",

After that, Snapmaker tried a dual-nozzle 3D printer called the J1. I've been having fun with it for a few weeks now. What's the difference between a tool changer and an AMS? It has to purge a lot of filament from the nozzle each time it changes colors and materials to make sure they don't mix on the print itself. The price is also a limiting factor, as tool changers tend to be more expensive than their AMS cousins. Even the suggested retail price is competitive with other high-end 3D printers at $999, keeping it suitable for small businesses and hobbyists. Some have even been great, but there's still work to be done. The single-color prints were all as flawless as you would expect from a modern 3D printer and could be easily sold on an Etsy shop -- while you still can, that is -- with no real post-processing needed The initial setup was also fast and simple compared to other tool changers I've used."

You can also tune into CNET's Made by Google preshow, starting at 12:30 p.m. Following last year's Tensor G4 chip in the Pixel 9 lineup, we presume that the Pixel 10 phones will be powered by a (supposedly named) Tensor G5 chip. We've heard a few Tensor G5 rumors, including that it will be made on an industry-standard 3nm process by chip fabricator TSMC, according to an Android Authority March report. Other rumors are less promising, like a July report from WCCFTech suggesting that while the Tensor G5 is a significant upgrade on last year's Tensor G4, a leaked benchmark test claims it will run slower than the Snapdragon 8 Elite processor that's used in Samsung's Galaxy S25 line and the OnePlus 13. Google on Aug. 12 released a video that shows off what the Pixel 10 Pro Fold will look like. This peek only provides a look at the phone's design -- which seems to be similar to last year's Pixel 9 Pro Fold -- saving a more detailed look at its specs and cameras for the Aug. 20 event. The more iterative design makes sense, as last year's Pixel 9 Pro Fold already debuted a larger overhaul that altered its design from the wider passport-size original Pixel Fold to a taller, narrower format similar to other foldables like the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7. One Pixel 10 Pro Fold rumor from WCCFTech only shared details about the supposed Tensor chip powering it. The Pixel 10 Pro Fold would presumably get Android 16 out of the box, but as that software upgrade has been released early (mere weeks after Google I/O 2025), last year's Pixel 9 Pro Fold already has that update."

The feature was first announced at Meta’s Connect developer conference last year, where the company said it would pilot test automatic translations of creators’ voices in reels across both Facebook and Instagram. In addition, creators can optionally use a lip-sync feature to align the translation with their lip movements, which makes it seem more natural. At launch, the feature supports translations from English to Spanish and vice versa, with more languages to be added over time. These AI translations are available to Facebook creators with 1,000 or more followers and all public Instagram accounts globally, where Meta AI is offered. To access the option, creators can click on “Translate your voice with Meta AI” before publishing their reel. When they click “Share now” to publish their reel, the translation will be available automatically. This can help them better understand how their content is reaching new audiences via translations — something that will be more helpful as additional languages are supported over time. Meta recommends that creators who want to use the feature face forward, speak clearly, and avoid covering their mouth when recording. “We believe there are lots of amazing creators out there who have potential audiences who don’t necessarily speak the same language,” explained Instagram head Adam Mosseri in a post on Instagram."

    "summary": "Nintendo has confirmed that Kirby Air Riders, a modern revival of the 2003 GameCube cult classic Kirby Air Ride, will be released exclusively on Switch 2 on November 20. The announcement came during a marathon 45-minute Nintendo Direct devoted entirely to the new game, hosted by Kirby's creator Masahiro Sakurai. Sakurai said he was asked to create Air Riders while still working on DLC for Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, and drafted a written proposal for the game at the request of Shinya Takahashi, head of software development for Nintendo.\nThe Direct showed a roster of playable characters, including King Dedede, Meta Knight, Bandana Waddle Dee, Knuckle Joe and others. Each rider has distinct traits and special attacks that influence how their machines perform. The ride mechanics will be fairly simple, with players able to boost, drift, glide and rail-grind their way around.\nPlayers will be able to customize and upgrade their vehicles throughout the game, which includes two major modes. Air Ride is the straightforward racing mode, with players competing on themed tracks. City Trial lets players explore a floating island called Skyah, where they can find power-ups and encounter random events like Dustup Derby, where they battle opponents to knock them out and earn more power-ups. Once players feel their machine is sufficiently powered up, they can head to the Stadium to complete different challenges against opponents. Local multiplayer supports up to eight players, while online lobbies can hold 16.\nA demo version of Kirby Air Riders will be playable by reservation for attendees of PAX West 2025 in Seattle at the end of the month. Masahiro Sakurai said a similar demo will be available to play at Gamescom in Cologne this week.\nKirby Air Riders will release on November 20 and marks yet another Switch 2 exclusive coming early in the life cycle of the hit console. Nintendo has already found success with Donkey Kong Bananza and Mario Kart World.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/kirby-air-riders-launches-november-20-exclusively-on-switch-2-171054821.html?src=rss",

The announcement came during a marathon 45-minute Nintendo Direct devoted entirely to the new game, hosted by Kirby's creator Masahiro Sakurai. Sakurai said he was asked to create Air Riders while still working on DLC for Super Smash Bros. Ultimate , and drafted a written proposal for the game at the request of Shinya Takahashi, head of software development for Nintendo. Each rider has distinct traits and special attacks that influence how their machines perform. Players will be able to customize and upgrade their vehicles throughout the game, which includes two major modes. Air Ride is the straightforward racing mode, with players competing on themed tracks. City Trial lets players explore a floating island called Skyah, where they can find power-ups and encounter random events like Dustup Derby, where they battle opponents to knock them out and earn more power-ups. Local multiplayer supports up to eight players, while online lobbies can hold 16. Masahiro Sakurai said a similar demo will be available to play at Gamescom in Cologne this week."

    "summary": "Helldivers 2 is getting a Halo crossover. On August 26, gear inspired by Halo 3: ODST will be available in the Sony-published Helldivers game. Practically speaking, this is about some new armor, guns and abilities — just another Tuesday in the gaming world. But symbolically, it evokes Sonic the Hedgehog's first appearance on a Nintendo console.\nThe crossover's arrival coincides with Helldivers 2's arrival on Xbox Series X/S. (That's also on August 26.) It also comes amid rumors that Halo: The Master Chief Collection could arrive on PlayStation as soon as this year. The times they are a-changin', as Microsoft adjusts to its new reality as a console hardware also-ran.\nThe gear will be available through the Helldivers 2 x Halo: ODST Legendary Warbond. In Helldivers, a Warbond is essentially a non-expiring equivalent of a battle pass. This one costs 1,500 Super Credits in the game's Acquisitions Center.\nHere, ODST no longer means Orbital Drop Shock Troopers. Adopting Helldivers' cheeky tone, it now stands for Obedient Democracy Support Troopers. Kind of them to lend a hand to the cause.\nPlayStation\nSo, what do you get for those Super Credits? The standout is the Halo 3: ODST armor, which has a Master Chief-esque flair. There are two variants: A-9 Helljumper Armor Set modeled after an ODST trooper. Meanwhile, the A-35 Recon Armor Set is a stealth-focused variant. Both include a Feet First passive boost. This makes you quieter, increases your range when finding points of interest and makes you immune to leg injuries.\nAs for the guns, you get the Halo series' classic MA5C Assault Rifle and M6C / SOCOM Pistol. Also available for your arsenal: the M90A Shotgun and M7S SMG. And who doesn't love a cape? There are two of those — one with an ODST logo and an Eye of the Clandestine one for the stealth getup.\nThe Helldivers 2 x Halo: ODST warbond arrives on August 26 at 8AM ET.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/sony-and-microsoft-continue-to-make-nice-with-halo-x-helldivers-2-crossover-165024127.html?src=rss",

    "full_text": "As an older gamer, you'd think I have a fondness for retro games. That may sound pretentious coming from a reviewer, but the collection is both an homage to an important era of video games and a reimagining that weaves in modern concepts and ideas. The Switch has long been a haven for indie games, and developer Mossmouth's collection fits perfectly into that tradition. All are said to have been developed in the mid-1980s, representing different points in the studio's timeline, with inspirations ranging from movies and newspaper articles to even a worker's pet. Yes, this is a tower defense game that looks like it could have been on the NES. Then there are titles that take modern genres and give them a full retro makeover. Night Manor is a point-and-click adventure in the vein of Shadowgate or Uninvited, but with added chase sequences and hiding mechanics. While plenty of UFO 50's games are solid, a few didn't sit well with me, and some fall into genres I just don't enjoy even with modern graphics. It's the kind of collection I can pick up a year from now and dive right back in, yet it also has that pull that makes me want to play whenever I have free time. It's easy to be turned off by the retro graphics, simple controls or rudimentary narratives."

Real-money gaming has been the biggest revenue driver for India’s online gaming industry, which generated $3.8 billion in revenue in the financial year 2023–24 — a 23% increase year-over-year, per a recent report by gaming-focused VC firm Lumikai. Real-money gaming alone accounted for $2.4 billion of that total, the firm said. However, the sector has come under growing scrutiny amid public concerns over incidents of harm — including cases where individuals reportedly died by suicide after losing large sums of money in games. The draft legislation states that real-money gaming companies could face imprisonment for up to three years, a fine of up to ₹10 million (approximately $115,000), or both. Likewise, some startups have explored going outside India to sustain their business amid regulatory challenges in the country. This is not the first time New Delhi has looked to regulate real-money gaming. It proposed the creation of self-regulatory bodies to approve legitimate games while restricting illegal betting and gambling. However, the self-regulation model faltered due to conflicts among industry stakeholders over enforcement and standards. The Indian IT ministry did not respond to a request for comment."

The new wave of gaming gear was developed with major esports organization Fnatic, and the specs are meant to target competitive players. All of the items are available for pre-order today.\nThe lineup includes a pair of audio devices: the Inzone H9 II Wireless Gaming Headset and the Inzone E9 In-Ear Monitor. The H9 II headset has the same dynamic driver as the excellent Sony WH-1000XM6 headphones, and it sports a detachable mic. It can be used wired or as a Bluetooth wireless set. These headphones have active noise canceling and 360 Spatial Sound. It will retail for $350. The E9 monitor also offers 360 Spatial Sound and is designed for passive noise canceling. It costs $150.

The 6mm Mat-F is intended for strategic first person shooters and games that favor controlled stop and aim playstyles. The black design has a Slimflex base and will retail for $60. Mat-D costs $35 and is meant more for speedy gameplay with gliding movements.

    "summary": "It feels like Summer Game Fest is only just in our rear view mirror and yet there's another video game extravaganza on the horizon. Gamescom is the planet's largest gaming event and we're sure to find out about a bunch of interesting new games at the Opening Night Live showcase. Xbox is broadcasting from the show floor across two days, and there will be other presentations that are worth keeping an eye on, including a \"special announcement\" for Hollow Knight: Silksong. \nGamescom is taking place between August 20 and 24 this year, and we're learning bits and pieces about what to expect from the various showcases. The affair will kick off with Opening Night Live, a showcase hosted by Geoff Keighley that bridges the gap between his two other major events, Summer Game Fest Live and The Game Awards. That will be followed by two days of Xbox broadcasts, the latest edition of the Future Games Show and three days of Bethesda streams.\nThere will also be news from Ubisoft on what's next for The Division 2. The company will host two panels related to the franchise during Gamescom. One will include more info about The Division Resurgence (a delayed mobile game), as well details about a \"big Division 2 project.\"\nWe'll update this preview with more Gamescom details as we get them, and embed video versions of each stream as they become available too. Here's our breakdown of how to watch Gamescom 2025 and what to expect from the event.\nGamescom schedule\n\nOpening Night Live — August 19, 1:30PM ET (pre-show), 2PM (main show)\nXbox @ gamescom 2025 Broadcast — August 20, 9AM ET\nFuture Games Show — August 20, 2PM ET\nXbox @ gamescom 2025 Broadcast — August 21, 9AM ET\nHollow Knight: Silksong - Special Announcement — August 21, 10:30AM ET\nAwesome Indies — August 21, 12PM ET\nBethesda — August 22-25\n\nHow to watch Gamescom Opening Night Live - August 19, 2PM ET\nWatch on YouTube\n\nOpening Night Live perhaps won't feature as many heavy hitters as Summer Game Fest Live or The Game Awards typically have, but one thing's for certain: Call of Duty fans will definitely want to tune in. The two-hour showcase will feature the \"worldwide reveal\" of Call of Duty: Black Ops 7. We'll almost certainly get a release date here too. Reports suggest we won't get a release date for Hollow Knight: Silksong at ONL, but we may not have to wait much longer... (more on that in a bit).\nYou can also expect a trailer for multiplayer RPG Honor of Kings: World, along with new looks at Ghost of Yotei, The Outer Worlds 2, Resident Evil Requiem, Silent Hill f, Ninja Gaiden 4, Daemon X Machina: Titanic Scion and The Seven Deadly Sins: Origin. You'll get to see the opening cinematic for the World of Warcraft: Midnight expansion as well. \nIt won't all be game reveals and announcements, though — there'll be a performance of music from Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 featuring composer Lorien Testard and vocalist Alice Duport-Percier. Additionally, you'll get a peek at season two of Prime Video's Fallout series, which will arrive in December.\nWe'll be keeping tabs on all the news from Opening Night Live right here on Engadget. Myself, senior editor Jess Conditt and editor-in-chief Aaron Souppouris will be live-blogging our way through ONL. Join us! It should be fun.\nHow to watch Xbox @ gamescom 2025 Day 1 Broadcast — August 20, 9AM ET\nWatch on YouTube, Twitch, TikTok or Facebook\n\nOne major piece of news we're likely to get from Xbox during one of its streams (if it isn't revealed at ONL beforehand) is the release date and pricing for the ASUS ROG Xbox Ally and Xbox Ally X handheld systems. Leaker billbil-kun has reported the devices will arrive on October 16, at least in Europe, costing €599 for the Xbox Ally and €899 for the higher-end Xbox Ally X.\nMicrosoft had already confirmed these handhelds would be available in time for the holiday season, so that rumored release date makes sense. Either way, we should get confirmation during Gamescom of when to expect these devices, especially since the company says it will discuss the handhelds during its August 20 stream. \nThis particular event will feature the likes of Grounded 2, Keeper and Call of Duty: Black Ops 7. The Order of Giants, an expansion for Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, will be showcased alongside Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade, Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, Dying Light: The Beast, World of Warcraft: Midnight, Hotel Barcelona, Invincible Vs., Cronos: The New Dawn, Outbound, Powerwash Simulator 2 and Starsand Island.\nAlong with the English-language broadcast, Xbox's streams will be available in other languages on regional Xbox channels on the likes of YouTube, Twitch, TikTok and Facebook. The streams will be available in Traditional Chinese, German, French, Japanese, Brazilian Portuguese and Mexican Spanish, as well as with ASL and English audio descriptions.\nHow to watch Future Games Show — August 20, 2PM ET\nWatch on Twitch or YouTube\n\nActors David Hayter (Snake in the Metal Gear series) and Maggie Robertson (Lady Dimitrescu in Resident Evil Village) will be hosting this edition of the Future Games Show. This installment will feature more than 50 games across world premieres, new trailers and sudden demo releases. \nCapcom, Bandai Namco Entertainment, EA and NACON are among those who'll be represented in this one, which will feature projects from AAA and indie publishers and studios. Several games have been confirmed to make an appearance here, including Skate (which is slated to hit early access this year), Resident Evil Requiem, Cronos: The New Dawn, Hotel Barcelona, Deer & Boy, The Seven Deadly Sins: Origin and Katanaut. Not only that, there will be a post-show that will run for 40 minutes and feature more trailers, world premieres and demo announcements.\nHow to watch Xbox @ gamescom 2025 Day 2 Broadcast — August 21, 9AM ET\nWatch on YouTube, Twitch, TikTok or Facebook\n\nXbox will be broadcasting live from the Gamescom show floor for a second straight day. This particular stream will include details on Ninja Gaiden 4, The Outer Worlds 2 and Overwatch 2 (perhaps with more info about Season 18, which is set to start on August 26). \nYou can also expect looks at Onimusha: Way of the Sword, At Fate's End, Age of Empires IV, High on Life 2, Jurassic World Evolution 3 and Fragpunk. In addition, the lineup for this stream includes Silent Hill f, Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, Lego Voyagers, Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles, Mortal Kombat: Legacy Kollection, Mistfall Hunter and My Hero Academia: All's Justice.\nHow to watch Hollow Knight: Silksong - Special Announcement — August 21, 10:30AM ET\nWatch on YouTube\n\nThis is not a drill. Team Cherry has scheduled a \"special announcement\" for maybe the most anticipated and hyped-up game this side of Grand Theft Auto VI. The developer and publisher hasn't revealed exactly what it plans to announce regarding Hollow Knight: Silksong, but it's gotta be a release date, right? A deeper dive into the game would be most welcome too.\nIt's been six long years since we had some hands-on time with Hollow Knight: Silksong. However, Gamescom attendees will be able to try it out at the Microsoft and Nintendo booths on the show floor. I hope the two companies have lots of space to accommodate what are sure to be long lines.\nHow to watch Awesome Indies — August 21, 12PM ET\nWatch on YouTube and Twitch \nThe Indie Arena Booth will host more than 200 games for Gamescom attendees to check out, but you won't necessarily need to be there in person to see them. Many will be featured in an hour-long showcase called Awesome Indies. Here, we'll see \"exclusive trailers, first peeks at never-before-seen gameplay, amazing premieres and exciting newcomers,\" according to Gamescom.\nThere are a lot of interesting games being featured at the booth, including Cairn and Strange Antiquities. I'm particularly hoping the showcase will include some more details about Ball x Pit, which is one of my most anticipated games right now, Militsioner and the creepy-looking Fractured Blooms.\nHow to watch Bethesda broadcasts - August 22\nWatch on Twitch\nThere will be plenty from the Bethesda side of the Xbox division as well. The publisher will be broadcasting from the Xbox show floor at Gamescom for three days, starting on August 22. According to Microsoft, these streams will include \"developer interviews, game showcases, community segments, crafting highlights and live IRL tours.\"This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/how-to-watch-gamescom-2025-and-what-to-expect-120024733.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Google didn't need to make its own smartphone. Even though the company spent several years having other manufacturers build phones it could slap its \"Nexus\" branding on, selling hardware is not core to Google's business. Things like advertising and Search still handily dwarf the inroads the company's made as a smartphone manufacturer, and that will likely remain true for the foreseeable future.\nCompared to the contributions the iPhone makes to Apple's bottom line, the Pixel has always, in some sense, been a hobby. Which means Google finds itself in a familiar place heading into the launch of the Pixel 10. It's better than it's ever been at the business of building phones, but the task for the Pixel remains the same: get people to use Google software (especially Search).\nThe first smartphones \"made by Google\"\nGoogle sold its own hardware, including a lineup of phones, under the Nexus brand from 2010 to 2016 — but it was always known that hardware manufacturers like HTC and Samsung were actually building the hardware. \nThat changed with the Pixel, the first time Google started using the now-ubiquitous \"made by Google\" phrasing. Ever since the first Pixel phone arrived in October 2016, Google’s phones have been defined by their camera skills. Google's significant breakthroughs in computational photography influenced the entire industry, and continue to do so today. The original Pixel and Pixel XL featured a single 12.3-megapixel camera and let anyone take great HDR photos without any fuss. Purchasing a Pixel or Pixel XL also unlocked unlimited full-resolution backups of your photos in Google Photos for free, a strong incentive to consider switching to Google's smartphone in its own right.\nThe company's glass and aluminum phone was more than just its camera sensor, though. A big part of Google's early pitch for the Pixel, and other hardware like Google Home, was that it could serve as a vehicle for Google Assistant. The AI-powered voice assistant had shades of Siri, and voice control features previously available in Android. But it was far more integrated into Google's software and services and had a deep well of knowledge to draw on from Google Search. An \"OK Google\" could let you set a timer on your phone, but it could also answer trivia or tell you about an upcoming calendar event.\n\n\nGoogle continued to lean on software for the release of the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL, which put Google Now-style proactive information on a new always-on display, along with a refined design with pressure sensitive sides that could activate specific functions on the phone. In terms of the camera, Google's major improvements over the original Pixel were the addition of optical image stabilization for video and a custom imaging chip, dubbed the Pixel Visual Core, that handled the image processing for both first-party and third-party camera apps. Besides being the first instance of Google sneaking some of its own custom silicon into its phone, the Pixel 2 was also was a significant challenge to Apple's dominance in the photography department\nThat pattern continued with the release of the Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL, which again featured a slightly modified design, wireless charging and a collection of new camera features. The biggest was Night Sight, Google's software solution for taking really good photos when there’s barely any light available. The feature was released after the Pixel 3 came out, and gave the phone the ability to capture more or less light at night depending on the shakiness of your hand. The third-generation Pixel was also paired with the introduction of Google Assistant's Call Screen feature, a mixture of visual voicemail and audio transcription that allowed users to see why someone is calling and only pick up if they wanted to.\n\n\nGoogle would go on to introduce the first budget version of the Pixel a few months later with the Pixel 3a, a practice that continues to this day. In the following years, the company's releases were mostly memorable for gimmicks like the Pixel 4's Motion Sense feature (using radar to detect hand gestures to launch shortcuts) and the adoption of industry trends, with the Pixel 5's support for 5G.\nThe company followed up those phones with a few releases that were only memorable for gimmicks like the Pixel 4's Motion Sense feature (essentially motion controls for specific apps) and the adoption of an industry trend, with the Pixel 5's 5G support.\nSay hello to the camera bar and Tensor chip\nIt would take the radical new design of the Pixel 6 to snap things back into focus for Google. Not only did the Pixel 6 have a massive, shelf-like camera bar on the back, but the phone was also the first to be powered by a custom SoC developed by Google. Rather than focus on raw power, the Google Tensor chip was designed to handle on-device AI tasks like Magic Eraser for editing photos, Live Translate for converting text to another language as you type and Direct My Call, which lets the Pixel navigate phone trees on your behalf.\nThe splashy launch of the Pixel 6 in 2021 marks the new path Google's smartphones have been heading for the last four years. They're still good at taking photos, but their main role is to be a showcase for whatever AI feature the company has cooked up most recently. Google continued to refine the idea with the release of the Pixel 7, which was paired with the first Pixel Watch following Google's acquisition of Fitbit in 2021. 2023 brought the Pixel 8 as well as the company's first foldable, the Pixel Fold.\n\nThe move also matched internal shifts at Google itself. The teams developing the Android operating system have long been separate from the teams building Pixel phones out of respect for Google's partners who make their own Android phones. That changed in 2024 when Google announced a reorganization that placed Pixel and Android under the same \"Platforms & Devices\" umbrella. The stated motivation was that aligning software and hardware would let the company release new AI features even faster, which bore out in the various Gemini features on the Pixel 9 lineup and whatever the company has planned for the Pixel 10. On some level the intimate role smartphones play in people's lives makes them an obvious venue for AI, something the company clearly wants to take advantage of based on in-development features like Project Astra.\nGoogle clearly experimented throughout the life of the Pixel, but the phone has always been a tool to sell software ideas. Demonstrating the potential of computational photography had early success, and now the company is trying to do the same thing with generative AI and Gemini. Competition remains fierce — OpenAI shared in December 2024 that ChatGPT had 300 million weekly users, making it a real threat to Google's core business. Google has never been a hardware company, nor has it needed to win at hardware. But with stiffer competition in software than ever, using the Pixel series to get people to use Google's many services is arguably more important than ever.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/10-pixels-in-the-purpose-of-a-google-made-smartphone-remains-the-same-160007404.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "NVIDIA is working on a new AI chip meant for the Chinese market that's more powerful than the H20, according to Reuters. It will reportedly be based on the company's latest Blackwell architecture, which can produce chips between seven and 30 times faster than its previous AI platform. Reuters says the product is tentatively named B30A and will have a single-die design, putting all its main components on a single piece of silicon. It will apparently be capable of half the computing power of NVIDIA's Blackwell Ultra GPUs, which have dual-die configuration. The product will also come with high-bandwidth memory and the company's NVLink technology for speedier data transmission between processors. \nIt's possible that NVIDIA is developing the chip after the Chinese government discouraged local companies from using the H20, especially for government and national security purposes. Chinese regulators even reportedly ordered big tech corporations, including Alibaba, Bytedance and Tencent, to suspend their purchases from NVIDIA until the government is done with a national security review. China's warning to local companies came after the US government lifted its export restriction on the company's H20 chips. \nIf you'll recall, the US blocked the company from selling its H20 chips to China back in April over concerns that the Chinese military could use the chips to develop AI technology. In July, NVIDIA announced that the government has assured the company that it will approve licenses to ship and export H20 chips to China. The Financial Times then reported in August that the government had agreed to grant NVIDIA (and AMP) export licenses in exchange for 15 percent of their profits. \nReuters says NVIDIA is still finalizing the specs of B30A, but it's hoping to deliver samples to Chinese clients for testing as soon as September this year. Trump seems to already be aware that NVIDIA is working on a chip based on Blackwell for the Chinese market, but whether it gets regulatory and export approval remains to be seen: The president told reporters that NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huan is \"coming to see [him] again about that.\"This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/nvidia-is-reportedly-developing-an-ai-chip-for-china-more-powerful-than-the-h20-130057520.html?src=rss",

Reuters says the product is tentatively named B30A and will have a single-die design, putting all its main components on a single piece of silicon. It will apparently be capable of half the computing power of NVIDIA's Blackwell Ultra GPUs, which have dual-die configuration. The product will also come with high-bandwidth memory and the company's NVLink technology for speedier data transmission between processors. China's warning to local companies came after the US government lifted its export restriction on the company's H20 chips. In July, NVIDIA announced that the government has assured the company that it will approve licenses to ship and export H20 chips to China. The Financial Times then reported in August that the government had agreed to grant NVIDIA (and AMP) export licenses in exchange for 15 percent of their profits. Reuters says NVIDIA is still finalizing the specs of B30A, but it's hoping to deliver samples to Chinese clients for testing as soon as September this year. Trump seems to already be aware that NVIDIA is working on a chip based on Blackwell for the Chinese market, but whether it gets regulatory and export approval remains to be seen: The president told reporters that NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huan is \"coming to see [him] again about that.\""

In fact, it's safe to say the format isn't going away anytime soon, with Adobe reporting there are 3 trillion PDFs in circulation worldwide. However, there's no denying they can be a pain to work with, and in an effort to make it easier to manage projects involving multiple PDFs, Adobe is launching a new product today called Acrobat Studio. And wouldn't you know it, the company is marketing the inclusion of generative AI tools as a major selling point of the suite.\nThe main feature of Acrobat Studio are hubs Adobe calls PDF Spaces. Here, you can upload up to 100 files — including PDFs of course, alongside public web pages, RTFs, DOCXs and more — and Acrobat Studio's built-in AI assistants will help you make sense of everything. To start, the hub will generate a summary of all the documents, with a few pre-populated prompts to help with further analysis. Accompanying each bullet point from the AI is a citation you can use to verify the model's summary by quickly jumping to the document it pulled the information from. Sharing your PDF Spaces with colleagues is built right into Acrobat Studio.\nIn addition to chatting with Acrobat Studio's AI assistant, you can create custom assistants to carry out specific tasks. By default, Adobe offers three of these — analyst, instructor and entertainer — to get you started. The names do a decent job of communicating each assistant's purpose. For example, the instructor will attempt to explain complex topics. You can create your own by writing a set of custom prompts.\nThere are some notable limitations to PDF Spaces. For one, the hub's generative AI features currently only work with documents written in English. Adobe says it will add support for other languages \"over time.\" Similarly, the hub can't analyze videos, handwritten notes and password-protected files.\nOutside of PDF Spaces, Acrobat Studio offers access to Adobe Express built right into the app, meaning you can use Adobe's Firefly AI models to generate commercially safe images for your PDFs. As you would expect, the suite also comes with Adobe Acrobat and all the tools you might need to create and edit your own protected documents.\nPricing for Acrobat Studio starts at $25 per month for individuals, with a 14-day trial available.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/acrobat-studio-is-adobes-new-ai-powered-hub-for-pdfs-130003264.html?src=rss",

Users can then browse their school’s page, filter by graduation year, and view all of the users who have added the school to their profile. The feature is available across more than 6,000 universities through TikTok’s partnership with UNiDAYS, a student verification platform that confirms student status. TikTok says the idea behind the feature is to turn its platform into a hub for real-world connections and belonging on campus, which is essentially what Facebook’s original mission was when it launched in 2004 as a way for Harvard students to connect with one another.

    "full_text": "The world’s most valuable chipmaker is far from giving up its desire to retain China as a key growth market. Nvidia is apparently putting together a new AI chip meant for sale in China that’s half as powerful as its flagship B300 Blackwell GPU, Reuters reported, citing anonymous sources. This new chip, codenamed B30A, would be more powerful than the H20 GPUs the company is currently allowed to sell to China, the report said, though its design will be single-die in nature, unlike the dual-die design used in the more powerful B300 GPUs. The B30A would still have similar features to the H20, like fast data transmission, support for NVLink, and high-bandwidth memory. “We evaluate a variety of products for our roadmap, so that we can be prepared to compete to the extent that governments allow. Everything we offer is with the full approval of the applicable authorities and designed solely for beneficial commercial use,” Nvidia said in an emailed statement. The news comes as the Trump administration in recent weeks has relaxed its stance on letting chipmakers export high-performance AI chips to China, though Reuters cited its sources as saying that approvals for this new chip aren’t certain at all. As geopolitical tensions between Beijing and Washington are increasingly affected by the race to develop AI, critics argue that the U.S. must maintain its lead by controlling the supply of necessary technology to China. But Nvidia and its peers — finding themselves selling the equivalent of shovels during a gold rush — maintain that ceding the valuable market of China to rivals like Huawei would be tantamount to giving up entirely.

But if that’s the case, you can be confident you’ll pay a lot more than $169 for the privilege. The AirPods 4 (without ANC) are down to $99. They fit and sound better than any non-Pro AirPods before them, and inherit some previously Pro-only features thanks to the H2 chip. If you travel a lot you’ll also certainly rue the lack of ANC, but if that isn’t a deal breaker for you, the $99 price point might be tempting.

The founders realized that evaluating and managing wanna-be agent employees is a job in itself.

Plus, there’s a list of the pizza ovens on my upcoming slate of reviews.\nTable of contents\n\nBest outdoor pizza ovens for 2025\nBest indoor pizza ovens in 2025\nWhat to look for in a pizza oven\nHow to prepare before outdoor cooking\nUpcoming pizza oven reviews\nThe best pizza accessories for the oven you already have\n\nBest outdoor pizza ovens for 2025\n \n \n \nBest indoor pizza ovens in 2025\nLet me preface this section by saying you probably already have an indoor option that you can use to make some great pizza. Whether that’s the main oven in your kitchen or a multi-function countertop unit, with some affordable accessories, you can easily up your game without spending $1,000 on a dedicated appliance. For example, my Breville Smart Oven Air Fryer has a convection pizza setting that automatically adjusts cook time based on the size, oven temperature and whether the pie is fresh or frozen. A key consideration here is size. These things are massive, about the size of a large microwave, so you likely won’t want to keep them out all the time unless you have a huge kitchen. \n \nWhat to look for in a pizza oven\nWhen shopping for a home oven or dedicated pizza oven, you’ll first want to consider what types of pies you plan to make. Most portable pizza ovens from the likes of Ooni, Solo Stove and others use wood burning fuel and are primarily designed for the high-heat cooking required for light and airy Neapolitan-style pizzas. We’re talking high temperatures up to 900 degrees Fahrenheit. These units can certainly cook different styles of pizza at cooler temperatures, but the learning curve is easiest when you’re running them wide open with a full load of wood.\nYou'll also want to consider alternate fuel types. If you purchase a propane or natural gas burner, you can adjust temperatures easily by turning a knob. For this reason, I recommend you spend the extra $100 or so on that accessory. This dual-fuel option makes your pizza oven a lot more versatile and gives you the option to still have a freshly fired pie when you don’t feel like messing with wood or charcoal. If you only want to cook with gas, there are models available that only use propane or natural gas.\nThe other key consideration for aspiring pizza makers is size. Most companies make ovens that fit 12-inch pizzas, a perfect size for a personal pan pizza. They’re also great for pizza parties, since people can customize their own without having to pick off toppings they don’t like. If you want to make larger pizzas or plan to use your oven for other things (pans, etc), consider a larger version that can accommodate more than just small pies. The interior dimensions – or at the very least the pizza stone size – will be listed on most product pages.\nHow to prepare before outdoor cooking\nMaking good pizza at home requires a considerable amount of counter or table space. You’ll need room to stretch and prep your pizza dough, lay out your mozzarella, other cheeses and toppings and load pies onto a peel. Of course, some folks will be comfortable working in the tight confines of a small kitchen, but I’ve found it much easier to use extra space to make sure I’m not constantly moving things around during the various steps in the process.\nIt’s also less hassle to set up your pizza-making station in close proximity to your oven. As a pizza-baking beginner, I did the running back and forth from the kitchen to the back porch. It’s far from ideal. It’s difficult to maintain your fire (if using wood or charcoal) when you’re unable to watch it closely. The good news is a patio table can be easily converted into a pizza station with a large cutting board. This also gets your oven off the ground so it’s easier to access.\nOoni sells tables for its ovens that also offer shelving and storage for peels and other accessories. Solo Stove has a rolling stand for its Pi oven too, with small side shelves and a spot for your propane tank underneath. Of course, you can find other tables and stands to suit your needs, just make sure they can withstand any heat that may radiate from the bottom of the oven while cooking. Most ovens are either well insulated or don’t project too much excess heat toward the table, but you can never be too careful. For that reason, a stainless steel or metal surface is a good choice to set up an outdoor model.\nMost of these ovens heat up quickly and cook at high temperatures, especially if you’re making Neapolitan pizza. Having everything you need nearby so you can keep tabs on the oven and quickly make the next pie — especially the first pizza — will ease a lot of unnecessary headaches. When your cook time is two minutes or less, you don’t want to venture too far.\nThe best pizza accessories for the oven you already have\nIf you want to make a good pizza that rivals that of your favorite pizzeria (and without spending hundreds of dollars on a dedicated oven), you can definitely do it with the home oven you already have in your kitchen. With a few gadgets, you can improve your game without splurging on a Breville, Ooni or Solo Stove. First, I’d recommend a high quality baking steel or stone.\nBaking stones are great for getting better browning on the bottom of your pies than a pizza or sheet pan. You can also use them for bread, cookies and other items. The stone absorbs heat to cook pizza quickly, so you don’t need to worry about preheating it, and you’ll get that charred crust like a brick oven provides. They’re also more affordable compared to baking steels. Those metal slabs do have one key advantage: higher heat conductivity. This means a steel will cook your pizzas faster since it can absorb more heat from your oven. While baking steels can be used as griddles on your stovetop and for other types of baking, they’re not ideal for some leavened breads.\nThe second item you’ll want is a pizza peel. These come in all shapes and sizes, made out of a variety of materials. I typically use a bamboo or wooden peel when topping and launching my pizzas and then a metal one for retrieving them. I’ve found that dough doesn’t stick as easily to bamboo during prep and the metal resists the high heat of the oven when turning or retrieving a finished pizza (bamboo will burn). There are also perforated peels which allow both steam and excess flour to escape. A peel is a great tool for loading and turning pizzas, getting them in the back of the oven, and since you’ll typically be cooking them with your oven at 500 degrees or hotter, using something like parchment paper to move them around won’t work.\nAnd if you’re going for a New York style pizza, just make sure your dough recipe and ingredients are geared toward that thinner, crispy crust — the right accessories alone won’t be enough.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/kitchen-tech/best-pizza-oven-141550352.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Handheld gaming systems are having a moment. While people have been gaming on the go since the halcyon days of the Game Boy, recent years have brought an avalanche of devices that let you play all sorts of games anywhere you want. But new machines seem to arrive every week, and figuring out which ones are actually worth buying can be overwhelming. Depending on your tastes, the right handheld could be a $70 emulator or an $800 portable PC. To help you narrow things down, we’ve spent months researching the best handheld gaming consoles and testing several top contenders. Here are the ones we like the most right now.Editor’s note (8/19/25): This is a somewhat awkward time to buy a gaming handheld, as new machines based on AMD’s Ryzen Z2 Extreme chip are on the way, including two new Xbox handhelds developed by Microsoft and ASUS. Those Xbox devices will bring an overhauled Windows UI that could address many of our longstanding issues with the OS. Beyond that, the Trump administration’s tariff policy and proposed repeal of the “de minimis” exemption continues to loom over the handheld market, potentially hiking the prices of retro handhelds built by Chinese companies in particular (among many other goods). Nevertheless, we’ve updated this guide with a new pick and stand by our current recommendations for those looking to buy a new gaming handheld today.\nTable of contents\n\nBest handheld gaming devices for 2025\nWhat about the Nintendo Switch 2?\nOther gaming handhelds we've tested\nWhat to know about the gaming handheld market\n\nBest handheld gaming devices for 2025\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhat about the Nintendo Switch 2?\n\n\n\n\n   Sam Rutherford for Engadget \n \n\nRead our full Nintendo Switch 2 review \nThe new Nintendo Switch 2 is already more popular than any of the handhelds above, but we haven’t made it a formal pick in this guide since it exists in its own world. As one of the newest devices from the big three console manufacturers, most people aren’t choosing between it and the handheld PCs or emulation devices above. The main reason to buy a Switch 2 is to play new Nintendo games, and no other device can (legally) offer that. Likewise, the Switch 2 doesn’t even try to offer the flexibility of a Steam Deck, ROG Ally X or even the Retroid Pocket 5.\nThat said, the hardware itself is a significant upgrade over its predecessor, with dramatically improved performance, a sharper, faster and bigger 7.9-inch display, magnetic Joy-Con controllers and more storage. It’s a wholly more polished take on the Switch 1’s ideas.\nDoes that make it a must-buy right now? Unless you’re worried about a tariff-induced price hike — which may not be the most outlandish fear — not really. Donkey Kong Bananza is a joy, Mario Kart World is fun enough and playing Cyberpunk 2077 on a Nintendo console is kind of surreal, but the list of true must-plays that are exclusive to the Switch 2 is still very limited. That’s OK — it’s only been two months. But don’t feel the need to rush out and splash the cash today unless you have a serious case of Donkey Kong-induced FOMO.\nOther gaming handhelds we've tested\n\n\n\n   The MSI Claw 8 AI+. \n \n\n   Sam Rutherford for Engadget \n \n\nNote: This is a selection of noteworthy gaming handhelds we’ve tested, not a comprehensive list of everything we've ever tried.\nMSI Claw 8 AI+\nThe original MSI Claw was a flop, but the newer Claw 8 AI+ is much more appealing if you’re willing to pay for a larger and slightly more powerful alternative to the ASUS ROG Ally X. With its Intel Core Ultra 7-258V chip and 32GB of RAM, it typically pumped out 10 to 15 percent higher frame rates than other high-end models like the Ally X and Lenovo Legion Go in our testing. Battery life is relatively strong, while its 8-inch 120Hz IPS display is plenty bright and supports VRR. There are smooth Hall effect thumbsticks and triggers, two Thunderbolt 4 ports and a built-in fingerprint sensor beyond that.\nThe Claw’s main issue is its price: At $1,000 after a recent price hike, it’s hard to justify over the ROG Ally X, which is already too expensive for most people. ASUS' handheld is smaller, lighter and generally more portable on top of that— though the Claw is thinner — and its Armoury Crate software, while far from perfect, is still a bit more polished than MSI’s Center M hub. There's also a smaller 7-inch version of this handheld for $900, but we haven’t tested that one.\n\n\n\n   The Lenovo Legion Go. \n \n\n   Photo by Sam Rutherford/Engadget \n \n\nLenovo Legion Go\nThe Lenovo Legion Go is another capable alternative to the ASUS ROG Ally X with an even larger display. It runs on the same Ryzen Z1 Extreme chip and offers a similar set of performance modes, but it has a mondo-sized 8.8-inch panel with a sharper 2,560 x 1,600 resolution and a higher 144Hz refresh rate. It also borrows some ideas from the Switch, including detachable controllers and a built-in kickstand for playing games in a tabletop mode. Those controllers have touchpads to make navigating Windows a little easier, something the ROG Ally X lacks.\nBut it’s still a Windows handheld, and Lenovo’s software tweaks aren’t as intuitive as what ASUS has done with Armoury Crate, so the UX can feel half-baked by comparison. The jumbo design is bulkier and heavier than the ROG Ally X, so some will find it too fatiguing to hold. Its fans are louder as well, plus the display lacks VRR. Lenovo teased a Legion Go 2 at CES earlier this year, which looks promising and should arrive in the coming months.\n\n\n\n   The Lenovo Legion Go S. \n \n\n   Sam Rutherford for Engadget \n \n\nLenovo Legion Go S (Windows, Z2 Go chip)\nThe Windows 11 version of the Lenovo Legion Go S has the same relatively comfortable design and commendable 8-inch 120Hz display as the SteamOS model we highlight above. With the Z2 Go model we tested, though, its performance lags too far behind the ROG Ally X, Claw 8 AI+ and original Legion Go for something priced at $730. Windows is still clunky, too.\n\n\n\n   The Ayaneo Flip DS. \n \n\n   Photo by Jeff Dunn / Engadget \n \n\nAyaneo Flip DS\nThe Ayaneo Flip DS is a cool concept: a powerful Windows machine with a clamshell design and dual displays, sort of like a supercharged Nintendo DS. It feels sturdy, it performs roughly on par with the other Ryzen 7 7840U (or 8840U) handhelds in this guide, and its 7-inch top display is sharp, fast and bright. The second screen makes it a natural fit for emulating Wii U or 3DS games, but you could also, say, look up a guide or play a YouTube video without having to close whatever you’re playing. \nUnfortunately, this is more of a neat idea than a fully thought-out product. The folding design means that the joysticks have to be short and recessed, while the face buttons and d-pad are uncomfortably flat. The whole thing is overly thick and heavy, plus it runs very hot. Battery life tops out around two hours, and actually managing two displays on a Windows handheld is about as clunky as you'd expect. With prices now starting above $1,000, the Flip DS is hard to recommend unless you’re (oddly) desperate for a handheld Wii U emulator. We're always happy to see more weird hardware, though.\n\n\n\n   The Ayaneo Kun. \n \n\n   Photo by James Trew / Engadget \n \n\nAyaneo Kun\nThe Ayaneo Kun is among the most decadent Windows handhelds we’ve tested. With a sharp 8.4-inch display, a Ryzen 7 8840U chip, up to 64GB of RAM, up to 4TB of storage, a sizable 75Whr battery and a 54W max TDP, it’s both a capable gaming device and a feasible replacement for a desktop PC. But it now starts at a pricey $999, it’s huge and it suffers from the usual Windows-related issues. It also lacks VRR. It’s still a fine device if money is truly no object, but it’s more handheld than most need. The ROG Ally X is a much better value. This is technically an older model for Ayaneo, too, as the company seems to launch a new handheld every other hour these days.\nAyaneo 2S\nThe Ayaneo 2S is another high-power Windows handheld with a sharper display and higher configuration options than the ROG Ally X. It also uses the same chip as the Kun above. But it’s limited to a 60Hz refresh rate and costs a few hundred dollars extra. Ayaneo announced a decked-out successor called the Ayaneo 3 toward the end of 2024; we'll try to test that one out in the future. \n\n\n\n   The Retroid Pocket Mini (bottom) and Retroid Pocket 5. \n \n\n   Jeff Dunn for Engadget \n \n\nRetroid Pocket Mini\nThe Retroid Pocket Mini is essentially a smaller version of the Retroid Pocket 5. It runs on the same Snapdragon 865 chip and feels just as sturdy, but it has a smaller 3.92-inch display with a 4:3 aspect ratio. This makes it a more natural fit for older retro consoles, as you won’t get the black boxes you’d see on a 16:9 display like the one on the Pocket 5. If you mainly want to emulate systems like the SNES, Sega Genesis or Game Boy Color and don’t mind paying extra for a rich OLED display, it’s a good little device. But the tiny screen is limiting if you ever want to play newer games, and we wish there wasn't so much empty space around the display. \nThis device had also generated some controversy within the retro gaming community for having persistent issues with inaccurate shaders (and for the slapdash way Retroid handled the matter). The company replaced the original model with a \"V2\" iteration that addresses those concerns, however.\nRetroid Pocket 4 Pro and Retroid Pocket 4\nThe 4.7-inch Retroid Pocket 4 Pro is the predecessor to the Pocket 5. Its performance isn’t significantly far off the newer model, so it remains a nice value if you’re determined to spend less than $200 on an emulation device. It misses out on the larger OLED display and more ergonomically-friendly design of its follow-up, however. The base Pocket 4 may also be worth a look if you want to stay under $150, but its weaker chip makes it less adept at emulating games from the PS2, GameCube and up.\n\n\n\n   The Anbernic RG35XX Plus. \n \n\n   Photo by Jeff Dunn / Engadget \n \n\nMiyoo Mini Plus\nThe Miyoo Mini Plus is a highly affordable handheld with a well-built, Game Boy-style form factor that fits nicely with older games. Its 3.5-inch display really pops for something in the $60 to $80 range, its battery lasts as long as it needs to and it can emulate consoles up to the original PlayStation without much issue. Its Linux-based software is extensively customizable, though it requires some tinkering to get it working optimally. Like many cheapo handhelds, it also lacks fast charging. Still, of the many Game Boy-like emulation devices floating around the budget end of the market, it’s the one we’d recommend first. Since it’s from a smaller Chinese firm and isn’t available at major retailers, however, it can be difficult to actually buy.\nAnbernic RG35XX Plus\nThe Anbernic RG35XX Plus is another wallet-friendly vertical handheld — or at least, it was before Anbernic paused shipments to the US. For about the same price as the Miyoo Mini Plus, it offers a faster chipset, more RAM and a bigger battery alongside a similarly impressive design. Its stock OS is overly sloppy and cheap-looking, however, and while the stronger processor is nice, the small screen and lack of analog sticks means you won’t want to emulate much beyond the PS1 anyway.\n\n\n\n   The Anbernic RG35XXSP. \n \n\n   Jeff Dunn for Engadget \n \n\nAnbernic RG35XXSP\nThe Anbernic RG35XXSP is a variant of the RG35XX Plus based on the same internals, only it apes the clamshell form factor of the old Game Boy Advance SP. That’s a great design to rip off if you must pick one, and the hardware doesn’t feel nearly as cheap as its (pre-tariff) price tag of $60 or so would suggest. But the software issues noted above still apply (both here and with the many other devices in the same RGXX family). We’ve also seen several user reports of quality control issues with the RG35XXSP’s battery, which is automatically disqualifying.\nAnbernic RG405M\nThe Anbernic RG405M is another 4:3 handheld with a 4-inch display and a pleasing metal frame. It's an OK alternative to the Retroid Pocket Mini if you want a little more screen space for less cash, but it’s slower, and it lacks the Mini’s OLED display. We find the Retroid’s grooved back to be comfier to hold over time as well. And again, Anbernic has paused handheld shipments to America as of this writing.\n\n\n\n   The PlayStation Portal. \n \n\n   Photo by Devindra Hardawar/Engadget \n \n\nPlayStation Portal\nThe PlayStation Portal is an odd accessory that’s designed to stream games from a PlayStation 5. It lacks built-in apps, so it doesn’t support traditional emulation. Because it’s entirely dependent on the quality of your home Wi-Fi, we can’t guarantee how well it’ll actually perform. It doesn’t work with Bluetooth earbuds either. \nThe 8-inch display is fine and the DualSense-style controls are great, so PlayStation diehards who want a second screen for local PS5 streaming may see the appeal. Sony recently added the ability to stream a selection of games via the cloud, which is a step in the right direction, but you need an expensive PlayStation Plus Premium subscription to take advantage. In general, there’s little here that you can’t do with a smartphone and mobile game controller, so most people are better off saving their $200.\nLogitech G Cloud\nThe Logitech G Cloud would’ve been a great Android pick when it launched if it cost about $150 less. Its 7-inch 1080p display is bright, vibrant and generally more pleasing to look at than the panel on the AYN Odin 2, its battery lasts a good 10 to 12 hours per charge and its design is comfy to hold for hours at a time. Alas, the G Cloud still tends to cost between $260 and $300, which is just too much when the Retroid Pocket 5 offers more power at a lower price.\nWhat to know about the gaming handheld market\n\n\n\n\n   Jeff Dunn / Engadget \n \n\nYou can break down the gaming handheld market into three broad tiers. At the top, you have x86-based portable gaming PCs like the Steam Deck or ASUS ROG Ally X. These are the most powerful handhelds you can buy, as they seek to replicate the experience of a moderately specced gaming desktop. The Steam Deck runs on the Linux operating system, but most others use Windows. If you want to play modern, recently released PC games on the go (and need something stronger than a Switch), this is the type of device you’d get. They can also emulate the widest range of retro consoles. They’re typically the largest and most cumbersome devices to hold, however, and their battery life can be short. Naturally, they’re also the most expensive, costing anywhere from $400 to more than $1,000.\nFurther down on the price spectrum are \"mobile handhelds\" like the Logitech G Cloud or Retroid Pocket. These devices often run Android or Linux and can range from under $50 to $400-ish (before tariffs). They aren’t equipped to play modern console or PC titles, but they’re usually more compact than a portable PC, and you can still use them for mobile games and cloud streaming. While most are marketed toward those ends, many gamers actually buy them to emulate classic games through software like RetroArch. Getting emulators to work can be complicated, and accessing the BIOS and ROM files required to play games this way is legally murky. One lawsuit from Nintendo led to the shutdown of the most prominent Switch and 3DS emulators, for instance. (Engadget does not condone piracy.) Backing up files of games you already own for personal use only is considered more defensible, though, so for that a mobile handheld can be a more user- and wallet-friendly way to play the classics — provided you don’t want to just use your phone.\nWe’ll call the last tier “handhelds that do their own thing.” This is a catch-all for things like the Switch 2 or Playdate: portable devices that run heavily customized software and aim to provide a unique gaming experience. They aren’t necessarily ideal for emulation or playing the latest multiplatform titles; instead, they often have distinct game libraries. They might not have the widest appeal as a result (Switch excluded), but they’re often easier for less tech-literate folks to just pick up and use.\nRecent updates\nAugust 2025: We’ve added the SteamOS version of the Lenovo Legion Go S as a new recommendation and updated our top Windows pick to reflect the upcoming release of ASUS’ and Microsoft’s ROG Xbox Ally devices, which will feature an overhauled Windows UI. We’ve also added a note on the recently released Nintendo Switch 2. We’ll include testing notes on the Retroid Pocket Classic, TrimUI Brick and ModRetro Chromatic in the near future. (Note: Yours truly went on paternity leave after our last update — apologies for the delay!)\nMay 2025: We’ve tested the Retroid Pocket Flip 2 and recommended it as an alternative to the Retroid Pocket 5. We’re also watching out for the first third-party devices that run SteamOS, starting with the new Lenovo Legion Go S, and the next ASUS ROG Ally device, which seems to be arriving soon based on recent leaks.\nMarch 2025: We’ve edited this guide for clarity and added testing notes for the MSI Claw 8 AI+ and Lenovo Legion Go S (Windows version). Our main picks are unchanged. Looking ahead, we’re keeping an eye on upcoming Windows handhelds from Acer and Ayaneo, a pair of new emulation devices from Retroid, the first third-party devices to ship with SteamOS and more machines that run on AMD’s Ryzen Z2 chips, among others. \nJanuary 2025: We have a new top pick among emulation-focused handhelds: the Retroid Pocket 5. Beyond that, we’ve added notes on a few other devices we’ve tested, including the Retroid Pocket Mini and Anbernic RG35XXSP; lightly edited other blurbs to reflect changes in the market; and removed a couple write-ups for products that’ve been discontinued. We're also keeping an eye on new handhelds that’ve recently been announced or are strongly rumored to arrive in the near future, including devices from MSI and Lenovo.\nAugust 2024: We’ve replaced the ASUS ROG Ally, our prior pick for the best Windows gaming handheld, with the new and improved ROG Ally X. We’ve also checked to make sure all availability and pricing details noted throughout the guide are accurate.\nJune 2024: We’ve updated this guide to ensure all of our recommendations are up to date, adding a note on ASUS’ upcoming ROG Ally X in the process. We’ve also included details on two new handhelds we’ve tested since our previous update: the MSI Claw and Ayaneo Flip DS. Staying on top of this market is a tall task, but we’re currently looking at recent noteworthy releases like the PSP-esque AYN Odin 2 Mini and the GBA-style Anbernic RG35XXSP as well.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/best-handheld-gaming-system-140018863.html?src=rss",
    "full_text": "To help you narrow things down, we’ve spent months researching the best handheld gaming consoles and testing several top contenders. Hall effect sensors (which reduce the risk of joystick drift) and dual USB-C ports are nice perks as well. But by default, the Ally X slaps a bandage onto an OS that isn’t designed for this form factor. That's mainly due to its Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 processor, which is the same chip used by flagship phones from 2023. Most significantly, it has a gorgeous 3.5-inch display that’s both backlit and incredibly sharp (615 ppi) but can be set to look like an old Game Boy panel with different filter modes. Like past Analogue devices, the Pocket uses field-programmable gate array (FPGA) motherboards to mimic its target systems on a hardware level. There's also a smaller 7-inch version of this handheld for $900, but we haven’t tested that one. Lenovo teased a Legion Go 2 at CES earlier this year, which looks promising and should arrive in the coming months. With prices now starting above $1,000, the Flip DS is hard to recommend unless you’re (oddly) desperate for a handheld Wii U emulator.

    "summary": "Intel has had some recent struggles in delivering results for its shareholders, but the company could soon be answering to an additional boss. The current administration is reportedly in talks to have the US government acquire a stake in the chipmaker. Bloomberg first reported the news without specifics about the size or value of the potential share the government wants to buy. According to a newer report by Bloomberg and The New York Times, the Trump administration is looking to take a 10 percent stake in Intel as part of its efforts to give domestic chip manufacturing a boost. \nThe administration is reportedly considering converting the $10.86 billion in federal grants Intel is getting from the US Chips and Science Act into equity instead. It's still early days, and the White House is still deciding on the exact size of the stake. Intel initially shared plans to construct a semiconductor facility in Ohio in 2022 while Pat Gelsinger was still at the helm of the company.

    "full_text": "Intel has had some recent struggles in delivering results for its shareholders, but the company could soon be answering to an additional boss. According to a newer report by Bloomberg and The New York Times, the Trump administration is looking to take a 10 percent stake in Intel as part of its efforts to give domestic chip manufacturing a boost. The administration is reportedly considering converting the $10.86 billion in federal grants Intel is getting from the US Chips and Science Act into equity instead. It's still early days, and the White House is still deciding on the exact size of the stake. Intel initially shared plans to construct a semiconductor facility in Ohio in 2022 while Pat Gelsinger was still at the helm of the company. Since then, the project has faced delays, and at its latest quarterly earnings report, execs said Intel would \"slow the pace\" on the Ohio construction, as well as scrapping other international building plans and making workforce cuts. A few days after calling for his resignation over connections to China, President Donald Trump met with CEO Lip-Bu Tan and seemed to now hold a more positive outlook on the company leader.

    "summary": "August is more than half over, which means we're getting ever closer to the usual September timeframe of Apple's iPhone event. That means the expected official announcement of the iPhone 17 line. The latest iOS 26 features will come preinstalled on the new models, as well as any additional features Apple reveals at the launch event. But since we still have to wait a few weeks (presumably) until the iPhone event, we can at least speculate what the new phones will look like. As with most unreleased iPhone models, rumors and leaks have trickled in about the hardware side ahead of the official introduction. Here's what we're expecting and what we can reasonably assume we'll get from Cupertino in September.\nWhat are the latest iPhone 17 rumors?\nThe latest rumor from a Weibo leaker known as Digital Chat Station suggests the iPhone 17e will come equipped with a new design that includes the Dynamic Island, MacRumors reports. According to the post, the new phone will have the A19 chip and could have a 6.1-inch OLED display with a front-facing 12-megapixel camera and a rear-facing 48-megapixel camera. \nIn additional to the usual caveat — this is just a rumor and we won't know what the actual iPhone 17 models look like until Apple's iPhone event next month — there's a second important distinction here. This report refers to the 17e model that would be expected to launch no earlier than February 2026, if it followed the same release pattern as the iPhone 16e.\nHow much will the iPhone 17 cost?\nApple's announced plan to expand US-based manufacturing partners seems to give it at least some shielding from the steepest Trump administration tariffs that have already triggered price increases on everything from Switch consoles to high-end cameras to Sonos speakers. But given that President Trump's trade policies can change from week to week, and Apple's continuing reliance on Asia-based supply chains, price shocks remain an ongoing possibility. The bigger question is: Will Apple absorb any higher costs, or pass them on to consumers? \nIf prices do creep up, Apple may choose to pair it with an \"upgrade.\" Consider this recent rumor posted by MacRumors from a leaker known as \"Instant Digital,\" suggesting that the default storage of the iPhone 17 line may start at 256GB, doubling the current 128GB baseline. While that could be accompanied by a price increase of $50, Apple could at least pitch it as a \"better value.\" That said, the company doubled the default RAM of its Mac computers from 8GB to 16GB at no extra cost in 2024 — but that was before the current Trump tariff cycle started.\nWhen will the iPhone 17 series be announced?\nMost years, the flagship smartphones are introduced in September. MacRumors highlighted a story originally reported by iphone-ticker.de that the Apple iPhone 17 event could be Tuesday, September 9, according to information gleaned from German mobile phone providers.\nIt's still too early to have the specific dates; some years, Apple only gives a week or two of lead time between sending invites and hosting the event. But years of past precedent show that sometime in September should be when the 17 models make their debut. This family of smartphones may be the last to follow that trend, however. There have been hints that the introduction of the iPhone 18 collection in 2026 will be split into a pro-tier announcement in the fall and a standard model announcement the following spring.\nWhat will the new iPhone 17 lineup include?\nDesign leaks suggest that Apple is building an ultra-thin smartphone, likely to be named the iPhone 17 Air to match Apple's ultralight laptop designation. Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, often a solid source of advanced intel about Apple, reported in January that the iPhone 17 Air will be equipped with a basic A19 chip and will only have a single camera lens. It may also use Apple's new in-house modem, which was introduced in February on the iPhone 16e. More details about this development may leak ahead of September, but that's what we know for now.\nAn investor note from Apple analyst Jeff Pu indicated that the Air will have a titanium frame. If his reports are accurate, the lightweight smartphone will be the only entry in the iPhone 17 lineup to use that metal; the iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone 17 Pro Max are expected to be made of aluminum, which is oddly a lighter material than titanium. Other speculation had suggested that the Air would use a blend of aluminum and titanium, so the exact materials may not be known until the official announcement.\nAdditionally, an August 4 MacRumors report says the internal battery pack of the iPhone Air is just 2.49mm thick — half the thickness of the iPhone 17 Pro battery. The leak was posted on the Korean-language Naver blog, where they show the alleged batteries of the iPhone 17 Air and 17 Pro side by side. The same account claimed the 17 Air's battery capacity was a mere 2,800 mAh, MacRumors notes. (That's below the battery capacity of current iPhone 16 models.)\nOn a similar topic, an iPhone 17 Pro production leak appears to have revealed an all-aluminum chassis, according to MacRumors. Originally posted by leaker Majin Bu, the image shows a shell that has a large round hole on the back (where the Apple logo typically is) to allow for MagSafe charging. MacRumors says this could just be a molding but notes that the aluminum frame (versus the current titanium in Pro iPhone models) would yield a significantly lower weight.\nThat same leaker (Majin Bu), whom MacRumors classifies as a \"hit-or-miss leaker,\" suggests the iPhone 17 Pro will have better wireless signal strength thanks to an updated antenna design. The individual posted a render on X that shows a new antenna system that wraps around the iPhone 17 Pro's supposedly wider rear camera bump. Again, this is a render, not a real-world photo. That said, we can't knock the goal of better wireless reception, so we're hoping this one has a degree of truth to it.\nEach new roster includes a base model, but over the years, Apple has shaken up the variety of phones it offers. Most likely there will be an iPhone 17 and an iPhone 17 Pro. Apple has also committed to the size matters philosophy, and has been building an iPhone Pro Max option with an even bigger screen and better battery life; the 17 roster will almost certainly have one as well. \nThe new Pro iPhones are said to have a full-width \"camera island\" on the rear, which would mark the first time an Apple model opted for that design. This feature can be seen in the purported iPhone 17 \"spotted in the wild.\" The pics, highlighted on MacRumors, show a black cased iPhone (17 Pro?) with the distinct back panel. Is it the real deal? The dual angles lend a degree of credibility in a social media landscape increasingly polluted with AI-enhanced fakes, but your guess is as good as ours.\nI just spotted a test development iPhone in the wild 🤩🤩🤩 pic.twitter.com/iS3PtKWqxJ— Fox Pupy 🦊🧡 (@Skyfops) July 28, 2025\n\nThe iPhone 17 Air seems primed to take the place of a potential iPhone 17 Plus. Since the iPhone 16e was only just introduced in February at a surprisingly high price point, it seems unlikely that there will be a new addition to that lower end of the spectrum, the models that were previously called SE. \nAt the very least, it sounds like the iPhone 17 Air won't take away the charging port and rely only on wireless connectivity. Bloomberg said that while Apple had investigated making the iPhone 17 Air without a single port, the company (fortunately) changed plans. He also says that the rumored phone will have a 6.6-inch screen and include the Dynamic Island and Camera Control button. Finally, the price is rumored at $900 — likely more than the standard iPhone 17 but less than the Pro.\nWe've also gotten what seems to be a reliable look at what the color lineup will be for the new smartphones. Macworld reported that the iPhone 17 will be available in black, white, steel gray, green, purple and light blue. The iPhone 17 Air will reportedly have four color options: black, white, light blue and light gold. While the Air colors will be less saturated, the visuals for the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max will go bold. The options for the Pro models are expected to be black, white, gray, dark blue and orange.\nOn July 30, Tom's Guide highlighted an X post from Sonny Dickson — a longtime and generally reliable leaker of unreleased iPhone information — showing \"dummy\" iPhone 17 models in the new colors that were the source of the aforementioned Macworld story. While these are literally just mock-ups — not real, leaked iPhones — it's interesting to see how the design and color rumors translate into a real-world look and feel.\nWhat will iOS 26 be like?\nApple upended its numbering conventions with WWDC 2025, and will match the name of each new operating system to the year it's released. So when the next wave of iPhones hits, they'll be running on iOS 26.\nOn the design side, the smartphone OS introduced during the big developer showcase took a contentious approach dubbed Liquid Glass. Apple has been scaling down the amount of transparency effects in the subsequent beta tests of iOS 26, but it will still have a glass-like visual.\nThe feature list includes big and small updates. On the more impactful side, the Phone and Photos apps have been redesigned. There will be several features leveraging artificial intelligence, such as live translation capabilities coming to Phone, FaceTime and Messages. Apple is also currently testing a sensitive content warning for child accounts that will freeze FaceTime video if nudity is detected by on-device machine learning tools. And the company is also launching Visual Intelligence, which will use AI to search for elements in an image.\niOS 26 also has a litany of minor, quality of life improvements. Group texts are getting support for polls. And for the slow risers out there, iOS 26 will finally let you escape the tyranny of the nine minute snooze alarm. \nThe next iOS is now available as a public beta. Here are our initial impressions of the Liquid Glass design and other new features. iOS 26 is compatible with all models back through iPhone 11.\nWhat other products are expected to be released alongside the iPhone 17?\nIf Apple follows its usual pattern, the iPhone 17 will be announced alongside new Apple Watch products. That would be the Apple Watch Series 11 (if Apple sticks to the same naming scheme), and maybe an Apple Watch Ultra 3 and/or an updated Apple Watch SE. (They'll all run watchOS 26, of course.) Other possibilities — and this is, again, speculation — could include refreshed Apple AirPods Pro (which received its last big update in 2022) and maybe new AirTags trackers (first released in 2021).\nThe Apple rumor mill got a big shot in the arm this week thanks to the reported inclusion of product ID numbers in recent beta software builds. Per MacRumors, it's a laundry list of new hardware, including long-rumored product updates like the Apple TV, HomePod mini, new Apple Studio Display monitor and two fresh iPads. \nOf course, even if that list is totally accurate, we may not see those products until 2026 — if ever. So don't expect all of products to share the stage with the iPhone 17, especially since Apple likes to keep its star performer at the center of attention. \nThat said, keep in mind that Apple has recently been having Mac-centric announcements in late October (as it did last year to debut new M4 Macs), so there's always the chance of another shoe dropping a few weeks down the road.  \nUpdate, August 18, 2025, : Added new rumor about the iPhone 17e potentially having the Dynamic Island.\nUpdate, August 15, 2025, 2:05PM ET: Added new rumor about the all-aluminum chassis on the iPhone 17.\nUpdate, August 13, 2025, 10:02PM ET: Added a list of the products that are expected to be released alongside the iPhone 17s. \nUpdate, August 11, 2025, 7:27PM ET: Added a render of a rumored new antenna design for the iPhone 17 Pro.\nUpdate, August 8, 2025, 4:43PM ET: Added new speculation and reports about iPhone 17 pricing.\nUpdate, August 6, 2025, 4:05PM ET: Added latest details about the potential iPhone 17 event date.\nUpdate, August 4, 2025, 5:23PM ET: Added latest battery leaks about the iPhone 17 models.\nUpdate, August 1, 2025, 8:15AM ET: Added new photos showing potential iPhone 17 colors.\nUpdate, July 30, 2025, 11:08AM ET: Added latest leaks and rumors about the iPhone 17, and updated information on the iOS 26 public beta.\nUpdate, July 17, 2025, 4:40PM ET: Added latest information about iOS 26, possible materials for the Air, and the color options for the different models.\nUpdate, March 17, 2025, 2PM ET: Added details about the rumored price and features of the iPhone 17 Air.\nUpdate, April 11, 2025, 3:45PM ET: Added details from Front Page Tech's new video that claims to reveal details from a leaked iOS 19 build.\nKatie Teague contributed to this story.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/apple-iphone-17-air-and-pro-launch-date-is-rumored-for-september-heres-everything-you-need-to-know-153024574.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "NVIDIA's GeForce NOW game streaming service is leveling-up in September with the addition of RTX 5080 GPUs, which will allow for 5K streaming at up to 120fps (or 1080p/320fps for the truly frame-hungry). While you'll need to be on the $20-a-month GeForce Now Ultimate tier to use RTX 5080 streaming servers,  NVIDIA at least isn't raising that tier's price. Subscribers at that level will still receive 100 hours of monthly playtime (with 15 hours of rollover), up to eight-hour long sessions and access to all of GPU's respective DLSS features, including Frame Generation.\nNVIDIA claims the RTX 5080 GeForce Now servers will perform up to 2.8 times faster than the current RTX 4080 systems — but of course, that's due to the new GPU's 4X Frame Gen capabilities, which interpolates frames using AI modeling. The 4080 only supports up to 2X Frame Generation. At launch, GeForce Now's RTX 5080 servers will support popular games like Doom: The Dark Ages, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, Cyberpunk 2077 and Flight Simulator. We're still waiting for a full list of supported titles from NVIDIA, as well updates on when we can expect more games that will support the RTX 5080.\nWhile the raw power of the RTX 5080 will be the main draw for the GeForce NOW Ultimate tier, NVIDIA is also improving something that's always bothered me with game streaming: image quality. No matter the resolution and framerate I've seen while streaming games across multiple services, I've always noticed that the color fidelity and overall sharpness doesn't look as good as rendering a game locally on a PC. NVIDIA's new Cinematic Quality Streaming (CQS) aims to change that, with support for YUV 4:4:4 chroma subsampling (for more accurate colors), smoother video streaming performance with the AV1 codec, and AI video filtering to reduce artifacts. CQS will also be able to automatically detect and optimize its settings for the DPI of your screen — that's helpful for high DPI laptop screens.\nWith CQS turned on, GeForce Now streams will max out at a hefty 100Mbps. That'll make it ideal for people with 1Gbps or faster connections, but it could be out of reach if you've got slower internet or restrictive bandwidth caps. I've only seen a screenshot of CQS in action, but it's definitely something I'll be testing further once the new GeForce NOW servers launch in September.\nNVIDIA also plans to expand the number of titles on GeForce NOW with a new feature called Install-to-Play games, which will automatically get installed to cloud storage servers. Performance and Ultimate-tier subscribers will get 100GB of storage for free, and they can upgrade to 200GB for $2.99 monthly, 500GB for $4.99 per month and 1TB for $7.99. Typically, GeForce NOW games are preinstalled on servers and wait for players to queue them up. (It's also worth noting that the service taps into games you've already bought on existing storefronts like Steam, your subscription doesn't get you a collection of games to play like Xbox cloud streaming.)\nNVIDIA says that GeForce Now will have up 2,300 pre-installed games this year, and together with Install-to-Play options there will be over 4,500 games on the service. That goes a long way towards making GeForce Now more appealing to mainstream players — if you could play most new titles over the cloud for a monthly fee, why have a gaming PC at all?\nTo that end, NVIDIA is also making GeForce NOW work even better across a wide variety of devices. It'll support up to 90fps on the Steam Deck through its native app, and it will also stream in 5K on newer LG OLED monitors. LG TVs will also get a native GeForce NOW app that supports up to 4K 120Hz streams, a first for any TV maker. NVIDIA also says that many Logitech racing wheels will be supported, as well. (Though I wonder how many people are traveling with wheels when they want to game on the go.)\nWhile its unclear if game streaming will ever replace local gaming, GeForce NOW is certainly getting close with the addition of RTX 5080 GPUs and a wealth of new features. And given the rise of streaming TV service costs these days, its pricing seems relatively fair. You can test out a free ad-supported version of GeForce NOW, or pay $10 a month (or $100 a year) for ad-free 1,440p support. For most people, especially if they're just streaming to laptops and handhelds, that'll be more than enough. But the Ultimate tier isn't unreasonable at $20 a month, $100 for six months or $200 annually. That's a small price to pay to game in 4K (and 5K!) without a huge rig.\nDuring my recent testing of GeForce NOW Ultimate with RTX 4080 servers, I noticed that it's relatively easy to launch games, performance is generally smooth and it works well across handhelds, TVs and multiple computers. I'd expect much of the same for the RTX 5080 servers, but I'll report back next month when they actually launch.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/nvidias-geforce-now-game-streaming-gets-rtx-5080-gpus-better-image-quality-and-more-193040331.html?src=rss",
    "full_text": "NVIDIA's GeForce NOW game streaming service is leveling-up in September with the addition of RTX 5080 GPUs, which will allow for 5K streaming at up to 120fps (or 1080p/320fps for the truly frame-hungry). While you'll need to be on the $20-a-month GeForce Now Ultimate tier to use RTX 5080 streaming servers, NVIDIA at least isn't raising that tier's price. No matter the resolution and framerate I've seen while streaming games across multiple services, I've always noticed that the color fidelity and overall sharpness doesn't look as good as rendering a game locally on a PC. With CQS turned on, GeForce Now streams will max out at a hefty 100Mbps. Typically, GeForce NOW games are preinstalled on servers and wait for players to queue them up. (It's also worth noting that the service taps into games you've already bought on existing storefronts like Steam, your subscription doesn't get you a collection of games to play like Xbox cloud streaming.) To that end, NVIDIA is also making GeForce NOW work even better across a wide variety of devices. NVIDIA also says that many Logitech racing wheels will be supported, as well. (Though I wonder how many people are traveling with wheels when they want to game on the go.) And given the rise of streaming TV service costs these days, its pricing seems relatively fair."

    "summary": "Liquid Glass is a huge new change coming to iOS 26. (Apple)\nWe're past the the halfway point of August, which means that we're very likely less than a month away from Apple's annual iPhone event. In addition to announcing its newest iPhone 17 lineup, the company will also give us an official date for downloading iOS 26. While we wait to find out, you can download and install the newly released public beta 2 (or iOS 26 developer beta 6 for developers). I've been playing around with it for the past couple of weeks, and have found that taking screenshots is way better in the new operating system — Google and ChatGPT search options are now in the screenshots editor, for instance. You can see a more complete view of the new features in our preview of the iOS 26 public beta release, which shows off the fresh home and lock screen redesign. Called Liquid Glass, the new translucent look will extend across all of Apple's upcoming operating systems. The overhaul is one of several big changes coming to iOS, macOS, iPadOS and the rest of Apple's software suite, all of which were showcased during the company's WWDC keynote on June 9.\nAfter overpromising on AI plans last year, Apple kept its iOS roadmap focused more on basic quality of life improvements this year. There are multiple useful additions coming to the Phone and Messages apps on your iPhone, for instance: Apple execs outlined the ability to weed out spam texts or other unknown senders and an option to hold your spot on a phone call when you've been waiting for a representative to pick up. Plus, a treasured feature that we took for granted is coming back (hint: it's in the Photos app).\nSiri, meanwhile, is in a holding pattern. Apple has previously specified that its smarter voice assistant — first promised at WWDC 2024 — is delayed until some point \"in the coming year,\" so you shouldn't expect any major changes in the current betas. But there are reports that Apple is aiming to give Siri a bigger brain transplant by basing it on third-party artificial intelligence models like OpenAI's ChatGPT or Anthropic's Claude, which could make 2026 a pivotal year. The company is also reportedly working on a 'stripped-down' AI chatbot to rival ChatGPT.\nWith each beta, it seems like additional new improvements are popping up, like this new AirPods gesture we're all curious about, and this FaceTime feature that'll freeze your video if it detects nudity. With the release of the iOS 26 developer beta 5, we saw more added features, like a new bouncy animation on the passcode screen and in the Control Center, MacRumors reports. Some or all of those changes will likely soon migrate into the separate public beta (see below). Most newer iPhone models are eligible to download iOS 26 (both the betas and final version). Want to see the full list of new features coming this fall? Read on. \nWhat is iOS 26?\nThe current iPhone operating system is iOS 18, and Apple is still actively updating it — version 18.6.1 was just recently released to restore Apple Watch blood oxygen monitoring functionality for certain users in the US, and another minor iOS 18 update is expected before the newest OS is launched, according to a leaker who shared the info with MacRumors. But don't expect to see iOS 19. Instead, Apple is skipping the numbering ahead to iOS 26 later this year. The company has decided to line up its iOS version numbers with a year-based system, similar to car model years. So while iOS and its sibling operating systems will be released in late 2025, they're all designated \"26\" to reflect the year ahead. \nIt's official, we're moving to iOS 26. (Apple)\nWhat is Liquid Glass design?\nLet's be honest. Out of everything announced at WWDC this year, the new Liquid Glass design was the star of the show. The iPhone's home and lock screens have looked pretty much the same year after year — the last exciting thing (in my opinion) was the option to add your own aesthetic to your home screen by customizing your apps and widgets. So seeing the home and lock screens' new facelift is refreshing.\nSo what exactly is Liquid Glass? Apple calls it a \"new translucent material\" since, well, the apps and widgets are clear. However, the screen can still adapt to dark and light modes, depending on surroundings. You'll also notice buttons with a new floating design in several apps, like Phone and Maps. They're designed to be less distracting than the current buttons, but are still easy to see. While the design overhaul has proven to be controversial since its announcement, some — including Engadget's own Devindra Hardawar — like the new direction, even if it's somewhat reminiscent of Microsoft's translucent Windows Vista Aero designs from nearly twenty years ago.\nThat said, as of the release of the iOS 26 beta 2, Apple has already incorporated some user feedback into the design, dialing back the transparency in at least some places. And while it will continue to evolve, Apple users won't be able to escape it: Liquid Glass was designed to make all of Apple's OSes more cohesive. Here's a look at how the translucent aesthetic will look with the new macOS Tahoe 26 on your desktop.\nWhat are the new and notable features of iOS 26?\niOS 26 has a laundry list of new features. Among the most worthwhile:\nPhone app redesign: You'll finally be able to scroll through contacts, recent calls and voicemail messages all on one screen. It also comes with a new feature called Hold Assist that'll notify you when an agent comes to the phone so you can avoid the elevator music and continue on with other tasks.\nLive Translation in Phone, FaceTime and Messages: iOS 26 is bringing the ability to have a conversation via phone call or text message with someone who speaks another language. Live Translation will translate your conversation in real time, which results in some stop-and-go interactions in the examples Apple shared during its presentation.\nPolls in group chats: Tired of sorting through what seems like hundreds of messages in your group chat? You and your friends will soon be able to create polls in group messages for deciding things like which brunch spot you're eating at or whose car you're taking on a road trip.\nFiltering unknown senders in Messages: If you haven't received spam texts about unpaid tolls or other citations, you're lucky. For those of us who have, those annoying messages will soon be filtered away in a separate folder.\nVisual Intelligence: Similar to a reverse Google image search, this new feature will allow you to search for anything that's on your iPhone screen. For instance, if you spot a pair of shoes someone is wearing in an Instagram photo, you can screenshot it and use Visual Intelligence to find those shoes (or similar ones) online.\nPhotos tabs are back: For anyone who's still frustrated with the Photos changes made last year, you'll be happy to know that your tabs are coming back. Library and Collections will have their own separate spaces so you don't have to scroll to infinity to find what you're looking for.\nFaceTime \"Communication Safety\" feature: A newer addition to iOS 26 appears to be the FaceTime \"Communication Safety\" feature that pauses communications if and when nudity is detected. The feature appears to be a child safety feature that uses on-device detection, thus obviating any cloud-based privacy issues. \nNew lock screen options: The iPhone lock screen gets more customizable in iOS 26, with a cooler clock, 3D wallpaper effects, more widgets and better focus mode options. \nApple's Hold Assist will be nifty for those pesky services that put you on hold for 10 or more minutes. (Apple)\nNew changes coming to iPadOS 26\nYour iPad isn't getting left behind when it comes to big updates. Here's what's coming this fall.\nMultitasking and real windowing: When you download the newest update, you'll be able to have multiple apps running on your screen at the same time. Once you open an app, it'll appear on your screen as normal but you'll be able to resize and move it across your screen to make room for other apps. This feature is optional so you can turn it off if you don't like it.\nVisual update: Along with the other new OSes, iPadOS 26 is coming with the Liquid Glass aesthetic. This new look will appear on the lock and home screens, as well as the drop-down menus.\nNew menu bar: When you swipe down on your screen, the new menu bar will appear with options like File, Edit, Windows and more. There's also a search option if you're looking for something specific.\nCheck out our first impressions of iPadOS 26. \nWhat about AirPods?\nAirPods are also getting updated with iOS 26. Here are some of the more notable functions.\nEnhanced audio recording: Apple calls this \"studio-quality\" audio recording, and with it, you'll notice more clarity while in noisy environments.\nCamera remote control: Using this, you can take a photo or start and stop video recording with just one press on your AirPods. When taking photos, you'll get a three-second countdown before your iPhone or iPad snaps the picture.\nLive translation feature: While not officially announced or confirmed, it appears that the long-rumored live translation for AirPods could be coming with iOS 26. The evidence comes from a system asset spotted in the in iOS 26 beta showing a gesture that's triggered by pressing both earbud stems at the same time. The photo also shows words in several different languages. \nWhich iPhones will be able to upgrade to iOS 26?\nA few iPhone models that run the current version of iOS — iPhone XR, XS and XS Max — won't be compatible with the latest upgrade. But any iPhones released in 2019 or later will be eligible for the iOS 26 update.\n\niPhone SE (second generation or later)\niPhone 11\niPhone 11 Pro\niPhone 11 Pro Max\niPhone 12\niPhone 12 mini\niPhone 12 Pro\niPhone 12 Pro Max\niPhone 13\niPhone 13 mini\niPhone 13 Pro\niPhone 13 Pro Max\niPhone 14\niPhone 14 Plus\niPhone 14 Pro\niPhone 14 Pro Max\niPhone 15\niPhone 15 Plus\niPhone 15 Pro\niPhone 15 Pro Max\niPhone 16\niPhone 16 Plus\niPhone 16 Pro\niPhone 16 Pro Max\niPhone 16e\n\nNot listed here are the presumed new iPhone 17 models (or maybe iPhone 26?) that are all but certain to be announced and released in September. \nHow to install iOS 26 beta\nThe iOS 26 public beta is now available to download via the Apple Beta Software Program. If you're not already a member, you'll need to sign up to try out all the latest features. Just visit beta.apple.com and sign up with your phone number or email address. It's free.\nOnce you're in, you can install it by going to Settings > General > Software Update and selecting iOS 26 public beta. \nA word of caution: Don't sign up with your main iPhone unless you're OK with any risks that occur with using an OS that isn't finalized.\nWhen will the final version of iOS 26 be released?\niOS 26 will be released to the public this fall. It usually comes in September, within a week of the Apple iPhone event. Last year, it rolled out to iPhone users on September 16 — exactly one week after the iPhone 16 lineup was announced.\nIf you're more interested in the Apple Intelligence features coming, here's everything Apple revealed for iOS, macOS and more during WWDC. Also, check out how iOS 26 screenshots could be an intriguing preview of Apple's delayed Siri rework.\nUpdate, August 18: Added details about a potential iOS 18.6 update.\nUpdate, August 15: Added to link to what to expect at the Apple iPhone event and details about what's available in the iOS 26 screenshots editor.\nUpdate, August 13: Added new AirPods detail spotted in the iOS 26 beta.\nUpdate, August 11: Noted that iOS 26 developer beta has hit beta 6. \nUpdate, August 8: Added new features coming with iPadOS 26 and AirPods.\nUpdate, August 6: Noted the release of iOS 26 beta 5 and the new bouncy feature on passcode screen and Control Center.\nUpdate, August 4: Noted that Apple is reportedly working on a ChatGPT rival.\nUpdate, August 1: Added quote from Tim Cook about iOS 26.\nUpdate, July 31: Noted that iOS 18.6 is now available. \nUpdate, July 24: Noted the iOS 26 public beta is now available.\nUpdate, July 3: Noted new FaceTime feature found in the developer beta.\nUpdate, June 30: Noted ongoing iOS 18 releases, and reports that Apple is considering additional external LLMs for Siri. \nUpdate, June 25: Noted changes added in iOS 26 beta 2. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/ios-26-updates-everything-you-need-to-know-about-apples-big-software-changes-coming-to-iphone-and-ipad-135749771.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "NordVPN announced today in a blog post that its Meshnet feature will shut down on December 1. All aspects of Meshnet will stop working on that date, though nothing else about NordVPN will be affected. If you were using Meshnet to connect computers, route web traffic through a personal device or share files, you'll need to find another solution by December.\nAs I mentioned in my NordVPN review, Meshnet was one of the most envelope-pushing features on any VPN, letting users link their devices through a NordLynx tunnel without needing to go through a third-party server. Once the tunnel was set up, you could access either device through the other one to share files or access services. With enough connected devices, you could check your work email, visit a friend's media server, play a remote game on another server and watch your home-based TV subscriptions — all from a single laptop anywhere on the planet. Unbelievably, it was even free to use.\nI'm sad to see Meshnet go, but as NordVPN's blog post makes clear, it never found its audience. As exciting as it was to people like me who spend all day squinting at the guts of VPNs, it didn't provide enough everyday value to catch on with the majority of NordVPN's customers. Hindsight shows us that Meshnet's benefits, like remote desktop and file sharing, were mainly business-oriented; selling those was always going to be an uphill battle in a market where VPNs are more commonly used for personal reasons.\nIf you're one of the few people who was actually using Meshnet, you have a few months to arrange alternatives. Should you want to stay within the NordVPN ecosystem, you can replace its file sharing features with NordLocker, which gives you 3 GB of storage for free. Of course, Google Drive is also an option.
