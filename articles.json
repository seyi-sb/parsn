MAI-Voice-1 is currently being used in the Copilot Daily and Podcast features. Microsoft has made MAI-1-preview available for public tests on LMArena, and will begin previewing it in select Copilot situations in the coming weeks.\nIn an interview with Semafor, Microsoft AI division leader Mustafa Suleyman said the pair of models was developed with a focus on efficiency and cost-effectiveness. MAI-Voice-1 runs on a single GPU and MAI-1-preview was trained on about 15,000 Nvidia H-100 GPUs. For context, other models, such as xAI's Grok, took more than 100,000 of those chips for training. \"Increasingly, the art and craft of training models is selecting the perfect data and not wasting any of your flops on unnecessary tokens that didn’t actually teach your model very much,\" Suleyman said.\nAlthough it is being used to test the in-house models, Microsoft Copilot is primarily built on OpenAI's GPT tech. The decision to build its own models, despite having sunk billion-dollar investments in the newer AI company, indicates that Microsoft wants to be an independent competitor in this space. While that could take time to reach parity with the companies that have emerged as forerunners in AI development, Suleyman told Semafor that Microsoft has \"an enormous five-year roadmap that we're investing in quarter after quarter.\" With some concerns arising that AI could be facing a bubble-pop, Microsoft's timeline will need to be aggressive to ensure taking the independent path is worthwhile.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/microsoft-introduces-a-pair-of-in-house-ai-models-193003900.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "You might already have a good idea of which smartphone you want to be your next one. But there are more solid options available now than ever before, making the decision not as cut-and-dry as it used to be. While the decision is a bit easier if you know you want an iPhone, there's even enough variation between those new models that you may have to think about it longer than you anticipated. If you’re an Android person, you have even more options to choose from — including foldables — and more questions to answer before you spend any money.At Engadget, we review phones regularly and have tested dozens over the years. Whether you’ve had your eye on one of our current top picks, one of Samsung's Galaxy S25 phones, a cheap phone or another device, we’re here to help you decide which is the best phone to buy this year.\nAndroid or iOS?\nWhen you're searching for the best smartphone, it becomes clear that each OS has its pros and cons. Apple’s tight-knit ecosystem makes it super easy to share data between iPhones, iPads and Macs or seamlessly hand-off phone calls or music from one device to another. At the same time, you’re effectively locked in, as services like Apple Messages aren’t available on other platforms. \nAs for Android, there’s a much wider range of handsets from companies like Google, Samsung, Sony and more. However, Android phones don’t enjoy that same length of software support and often have lower trade-in values. In short, there’s no wrong answer. However, you will want to consider how your phone will fit in with the rest of your devices. So unless you’re really fed up with one OS and willing to learn another, it probably doesn’t make a lot of sense to switch from an iPhone to an Android phone (or vice versa) – especially if everyone else in your household is using the same platform.\nCameras\nSince your cell phone often pulls double duty as your primary camera, figuring out what kind of photo tools you want is key. Nowadays, practically every mobile phone can take a great picture in bright light. But if you want a long optical zoom, you’ll probably have to upgrade to a more expensive device.\n\n\n\n\n   Cherlynn Low / Engadget \n \n\nMid-range phones often only have two rear cameras (a primary wide-angle lens and a secondary ultra-wide camera) and can sometimes struggle in low-light situations. Each phone maker also has various features that might be a better fit for your style, with Apple offering four different color presets on the latest iPhones, while Google’s Pixel 9 Pro comes with neat tools like dedicated long exposure and Action Pan modes.\nWill you get mmWave 5G or Wi-Fi 7?\nThe good news is that in 2025, most phones have at least Wi-Fi 6 or Wi-Fi 6e and support for some kind of 5G connectivity. However, if you want the fastest wireless speeds possible, it’s going to cost you a little extra. For example, on certain networks, mmWave 5G offers up to gigabit download speeds, less latency and better bandwidth. But mmWave 5G also requires more sophisticated (and pricier) modems, which means support for it is often missing on less expensive devices.\nOn the bright side, mmWave 5G isn’t as widely available as other versions of 5G, so depending on where you live and what network you’re on, you may not be missing out on much right now if you buy a phone that doesn’t support it. It’s a similar situation for Wi-Fi 7, which is available on some high-end handsets like the Galaxy S25, but harder to find on cheaper devices. Wi-Fi 7 also requires you to have a compatible router, so unless you know you need it or have a specific use case in mind, the lack of support for mmWave 5G or Wi-Fi 7 shouldn’t be a dealbreaker when looking for a new phone.\nOther features to consider\nBecause not everyone agrees on what makes the best phone, you should think about any other specs that might be extra important for you. Mobile gamers will almost certainly appreciate the 120Hz refresh rates you get on phones like the Samsung Galaxy S25 or the Apple iPhone 16 Pro. Alternatively, if long battery life is important, you’ll probably want to go with a larger iPhone or an Android phone with a battery that’s between 4,000 and 5,000 mAh in size. Meanwhile, if you find yourself juggling a lot of devices, it can be really nice to have a phone that supports reverse wireless charging, which on Samsung phones even lets you recharge the company’s Galaxy Watches.\n \n \n \n \n \n \nOther smartphones we've tested\nOnePlus 13\nWhile the OnePlus 13 features some basic AI features like Google’s Circle to Search and Gemini assistant, it’s really just an old-fashioned flagship in all the best ways. That’s because instead of focusing on machine learning, OnePlus crammed the phone with tons of top-notch hardware. It sports a 6.8-inch OLED display with an incredible peak brightness of up to 4,500 nits. The OP13 also offers excellent performance thanks to Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 8 Elite chip, along with 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage. There are also three 50-MP rear cameras including one with a 3x telephoto zoom and a massive 6,000 mAh battery that’s bigger than what you get in practically all of its competitors.\nOnePlus didn’t skimp on the phone’s design either, as the OP13 still comes with the company’s signature Alert Slider. Plus, if you opt for the blue or white variants, you’ll get a durable and very touchable vegan leather back that helps the phone stand out among all its glass brick rivals. But the best part is that starting at $900, it costs less than an equivalent Galaxy S25+ too.\nFAQs\nHow do I know which smartphone is the best for me?\nWhile choosing the best smartphone can be challenging, it mostly comes down to how you plan on using the device. All of the best phones available now get the basics right — you’ll be able to make calls, text and access the internet without many hiccups. If your smartphone is your most used gadget, you may want to consider paying for a device on the higher end of the price spectrum. That will get you better overall performance, higher-quality cameras and a phone that will last for many years. If you don’t use your phone for everything, you may be able to compromise on performance and extra perks and spend less on a still-capable handset.\nHow much is a smartphone?\nSmartphones range in price from $300 to over $1,500. The best budget phones available now will usually compromise on overall performance, design, camera prowess and extra features to keep costs down. On the flip side, the most expensive phones will have powerful processors, triple-camera arrays and even flip or fold designs. Most people will find a phone that fits their needs somewhere in the middle of that wide price range — we’ve found that most of the best smartphones available right now cost between $500 and $1,000.\nWhat can you do on a smartphone?\nSmartphones are essentially small, portable computers that let you do things like check email, browse social media, follow map directions, make contactless payments and more. This is all on top of the basics like making phone calls and texting, which we’ve come to expect in all modern cell phones. Smartphones have also mostly replaced compact cameras thanks to their high-quality, built-in shooters, and the fact that most smartphones today as just as portable, if not more so, as compact cameras.\nHow long do smartphones last?\nSmartphones can last years and people are holding on to their phones longer now than ever before. Software updates and battery life are two of the biggest factors that can affect phone longevity. Apple promises five years worth of software updates for its latest iPhones, and Google promises the same for its Pixel phones. Samsung phones will get four years worth of Android updates from the time they launch. As for charging speeds and battery life, your phone can deteriorate over time as you use and recharge your phone on a regular basis.\nRecent updates\nAugust 2025: Updated to include the Google Pixel 10 Pro.\nJuly 2025: Updated to include the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7.\nApril 2025: Updated to include the Google Pixel 9a.\nFebruary 2025: Updated to include the iPhone 16e.\nJanuary 2025: Updated to include details about Samsung's latest Galaxy S-series phones.\nSeptember 2024: Updated to include the latest iPhone 16 models and a new midrange iPhone top pick.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/best-smartphones-140004900.html?src=rss",

But mmWave 5G also requires more sophisticated (and pricier) modems, which means support for it is often missing on less expensive devices. As we discovered in our testing for the iPhone 16 Pro review, it’ll take a bit of getting used to at first. Not only do both devices now support full high-res portrait shots, its 100x Pro Res Zoom captures long-range photos in ways that lenses and megapixels alone simply can’t. Then you add in noticeably better performance, bigger batteries, brighter displays and proper Qi2 magnetic charging (the first from a major Android phone maker) via Pixelsnap and you have truly smart devices that makes picking anything else seem kind of dumb. So while it's not super fancy, the phone has all of its most important bases covered (and then some). Sadly there’s still no dedicated telephoto lens, which makes it less useful in some shooting situations. But the best part is that starting at $900, it costs less than an equivalent Galaxy S25+ too."

For a Pixel 10 Pro Fold, that jumps up to $339 for two years, or $18 per-month, with the optional loss and theft package for a small extra charge. Under the old Preferred Care program, replacing a cracked screen would run you $29. Under Pixel Care Plus a cracked front screen or battery running at under 80-percent capacity will get swapped out for $0. Unfortunately, if you happen to mess up the internal screen on your 10 Pro Fold, you are not covered. Other accidental damage fees vary depending on model, ranging from $49 on some older models like the Pixel 8a and 9a, to $99 on the Pixel 10 Pro Fold. On average they’re lower though, with service fees reaching $129 for the Pixel 9 Pro and Fold models. The new loss and theft option, which adds $1 or $2 a month to the plan, also varies per model with deductibles ranging up to $149 on the high end. The new plans bring Google more inline with the likes of Samsung, which ditched screen replacement fees under its new extended coverage plans back in January."

You can also utilize Alexa to change the TV’s volume and input without manually navigating through menus. If you want a more premium 4K TV than the Insignia model above (without breaking the bank, of course), TCL’s 55-inch QM6K comes with a surprising amount of features for its roughly $446.99 ($350 off) sale price at Amazon, and $449.99 at Best Buy. OLED TVs are more affordable than ever before, and this Labor Day deal on Samsung’s 65-inch S90D is proof. It runs on a processor that can upscale non-4K video to look better on a higher-resolution set, and can analyze what you’re watching to make objects in the foreground look closer than the background. The TV has Amazon Alexa built-in, and it runs Samsung’s Tizen operating system, so you can access TV shows and movies with your voice using a microphone built into the remote. The S90D can also access Samsung’s Gaming Hub, which allows you to play games from your Steam library directly from the TV (via Wi-Fi or ethernet) rather than manually connecting it to a PC. The store has over 2,000 images, including classics like Van Gogh’s The Starry Night, and requires a subscription that costs $4.99 per month or $49.99 per year. The Frame TV Pro has a matte display, which won’t show glare from light sources as much as an LCD or OLED screen, so the image on screen will look a little more canvas-like. Sony’s Bravia 8 II was recently voted the best TV of 2025 by a panel of experts (including The Verge’s Nilay Patel), and the 65-inch model is matching its all-time low price of around $2,998 at Amazon, Best Buy, and Walmart."

    "summary": "The BF6 minimum and recommended specs are here, showing what you need for 1080p and 4K gaming.",
    "full_text": "There aren't too many surprises on the specs list EA revealed in a blog post Thursday. Players with graphics cards as old as the Nvidia GeForce RTX 2060 or AMD Radeon RX 5600 XT (released in 2019 and 2020, respectively) with at least 6GB of virtual RAM can play Battlefield 6. That's reasonably inclusive for gamers running on older PCs, though they'll need at least 16GB of standard RAM and will only be able to play in 1080p resolution at 30 frames per second. For 1440p gaming at 60 fps, the publisher recommends players employ the next generation of GPUs: at least an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 Ti or AMD Radeon RX 6700 XT with 8GB of VRAM. Players clamoring for frame rates above 80 fps may have to lower their resolution and graphics settings. Gamers at this level will need 32GB of standard RAM and more powerful CPUs, like the Intel Core i9-12900k or AMD Ryzen 7 7900X3D, to avoid bottlenecking. While not quite as hefty as recent Call of Duty install sizes, Battlefield 6 will require 90GB of storage space at launch -- or 55GB if running minimum specs for 1080p gaming. This is not optional and requires changing settings in BIOS. It can be a quick process for gamers with newer motherboards, though those with complex or older setups can run into trouble. It doesn't seem like EA will budge on this requirement, so anyone wanting to play Battlefield 6 on its Oct. 10 launch day should enable Secure Boot to prepare."

When this guide was first published, Dbrand was in the midst of updating its Killswitch so that it wouldn’t allow the Joy-Con 2s’ magnets to break away without you pressing their release buttons. That said, it’s short on other perks to justify the price. Belkin’s case can carry 12 cartridges, and it’s only slightly thicker than the PowerA case, likely to compensate for whatever cables or small gizmos you might stuff into its pocket. Neither of those may be deal-breakers for you, but are worth keeping in mind.

It was also one of the few successes from PlayStation's live service push, in which the brand attempted to heavily invest in games that are frequently updated with new limited content and make revenue through microtransactions. Sony and Microsoft didn't just ease up by letting these games go to \"the other side.\" But at long last, Sony and Microsoft are allowing their franchises to be played on rival consoles as part of a broader strategy from both companies that prioritizes selling game copies no matter the platform. Microsoft expanded its Game Pass subscription to PC in 2019, and Sony started to trickle its exclusives onto the Steam storefront, starting with Horizon Zero Dawn in 2020. Games like Call of Duty Black Ops 7 will still be coming to PlayStation consoles. Players are responding (mostly) positively to easing game exclusivity, too. All it takes is one look at the Gears of War and Helldivers 2 subreddits to see forums full of gamers that are happy to share their favorite experiences with a new audience. Sony and Microsoft are starting to blur the line in the sand -- and we should take advantage of that to play some cool, new games, no matter our platform."

If you’re willing to settle for 1080p at 30fps in a online shooter (I won’t judge!) an RTX 2060 or RX 5600 XT or Arc A380 GPU with 6GB of video memory is apparently enough, with 16GB of RAM, 55GB of hard drive space, and a Core i5-8400 or Ryzen 5 2600 or equivalent. That’s even slightly lower than the open beta required, which needed 75GB of storage, and today’s the first time we’re seeing what developers say it’ll take to play at 4K60 Ultra (you’ll want pretty potent CPU and GPU for that).

Unfortunately, I won’t be able to get my friends to play it with me: they’re boycotting over its lack of Linux support, as BF6’s anti-cheat spares no thought for those of us trying to ditch Windows.

    "summary": "Fubo is making a move to attract new subscribers ahead of the NFL season. The company's new Fubo Sports bundle includes content from ESPN, Fox and local affiliates. The football-friendly package costs $56 monthly.\nFubo Sports includes over 20 sports and broadcast networks. You get all of ESPN's live channels (including ESPN+). As for Fox, it has FS1, FS2 and the curious inclusion (for a sports package) of Fox News. The bundle also has the ACC Network, Big 10 Network, CBS Sports Network, Fubo Sports Network, ION, NFL Network, SEC Network and the Tennis Channel.\nAdditionally, Fubo Sports has local broadcast stations owned and operated by ABC, CBS and Fox. The company says additional affiliates will be available in select markets.\nFubo says some content will be available in 4K. It will support VOD, Unlimited DVR and Family Share features.\nFubo\nYou can argue that Fubo's new sports package is the best value for football fans. At $56, it's pricier than the upcoming ESPN and Fox One bundle. (It arrives on October 2 for $40.) By comparison, Fubo's package includes all the same sports channels, as well as local stations (and more). NFL and college football fans subscribing to this could also likely skip Paramount+'s sports content. The football completist would only need to add Peacock for NBC's Sunday night games and Amazon Prime for its Thursday night matchups.\nConfused? Well, you aren't alone. In many ways, live TV streaming has become at least as convoluted as the cable TV it once promised to improve upon. Start with something simple, insert high stakes for wealthy corporations and watch a complex web of head-spinning shit come out the other side.\nRegardless, starting next week, you can try Fubo Sports for $46 for your first month. After that, it defaults to the standard $56. The bundle arrives on September 2, two days before the NFL season kicks off.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/fubo-sports-will-make-a-play-for-football-fans-dollars-on-september-2-164847466.html?src=rss",

But, when Mozilla announced in late May that it was shutting down the read-it-later app in July, the Kobo community was left in a bit of a lurch. To the company’s credit, in late July, it announced that it would be replacing Pocket with another stalwart of the scene, Instapaper. And, just a month after that, support is already live and available as a free firmware update for all currently supported Kobo readers (and the list is surprisingly long). If you’ve been on the hunt for a Pocket replacement ahead of all your data disappearing on October 8th, Instapaper now seems like the clear front runner if you’re a Kobo user, especially since you don’t need an Instapaper Premium subscription to take advantage. Hopefully the partnership will prove more fruitful than the one with Mozilla which hadn’t seen any significant improvements in years and was nearly killed off in 2023."

    "summary": "The RX1R III is an incredible camera, capable of capturing stunning photos. However, for something Sony waited nearly a decade to update and is charging $5,100 for, it also feels like a missed opportunity. First, the RX1R III is nearly $2,000 more expensive than its predecessor. Plus, it’s missing a handful of features the company really should have included for it to hold its own against other high-end compact cameras, including Fujifilm’s X100VI and GFX100RF, as well as the Leica Q3 family. I love the RX1R III, but I wish it was easier to recommend.\n \nImage quality and autofocus\n\n\n\n\n   Igor Bonifacic for Engadget \n \n\nNew to the RX1R III is a 61-megapixel full-frame sensor Sony first introduced alongside the A7R IV back in 2019. It might be an old component, but having so much resolution in a camera I could carry everywhere felt like cheating. \nWhat hasn't changed is the glass on the RX1R III. The camera still has the same fixed 35mm f/2.0 Zeiss lens that debuted on the original RX1R in 2012. With past models, autofocus was often an issue, but it turns out the Zeiss lens wasn't to blame. It was the focusing algorithms on the older cameras.\nLike the A7R V, the RX1R III comes with Sony's flagship Bionz XR image processor and a dedicated chip for AI-assisted subject detection. At first, I was skeptical of the RX1R III's autofocus capabilities since the camera doesn't come with a joystick to make it easy to set a focus point manually. As it turns out, it doesn't need one. The autofocus on the RX1R III feels magical, thanks to its subject tracking. The seven different recognition modes offered by the RX1R III cover most of the things I like to shoot — including people, pets and birds — and getting the camera to lock onto a subject was simple. All I had to do was press and hold the new \"AF-ON\" button. The camera can be configured to prioritize specific subjects, but I found that wasn't necessary to do; I could delegate focusing entirely to the camera.\nAll of that brings me back to the RX1R III's Zeiss glass. I know some people will be disappointed Sony didn't add a new lens, but I'm a fan of the decision. For me, the character of that lens has always been part of the appeal of the series, and it's my favorite aspect of the new model.\nWith Sony's 61MP sensor behind it, the Zeiss optics can capture photos with a great amount of detail without ever feeling clinical or overly sharp like with many of the company's G Master lenses. The best way I can describe the rendering is that it's Leica-like with beautiful, creamy bokeh. With the right light, the RX1R III can produce images that look almost painterly, and reviewing the photos I snapped with it, they're among some of the best I've captured in the 10 years I've been shooting.\nAt the same time, I think Sony deserves credit for greatly improving the color science of its JPEGs. The company has long offered excellent RAW support, but the older I get, the more I appreciate a camera that can produce great images with minimal editing. With the RX1R III, Sony has delivered that. The camera offers a total of 12 JPEG profiles with six custom slots. Two of the default profiles, Film 2 and Film 3, are borrowed from the FX3, and offer calming, muted tones that are a nice contrast to the more vivid colors Sony is typically known for.\nAs for video, there's not much to say. The RX1R III can capture 4K footage at 60 frames per second and 1080p clips at 120 fps. That said, as I'll get to in a moment, Sony's new model is missing some features that would have made it a competent video camera. As things stand, I think it's only suited for capturing home videos you don't plan to share with the world.\nDesign and handling\n\n\n\n\n   Igor Bonifacic for Engadget \n \n\nThe first time I looked through the RX1R III's viewfinder, I thought Sony had sent me a defective unit. The redesigned EVF is now built into the top left of the camera, but the company seems to have pulled the screen from the parts bin, as it only offers 2.36 million dots of resolution. For context, the A7R V has a 9.44-million-dot OLED EVF, while the older A7R IV has a 5.76-million-dot screen. It's jarring going from the new rear-panel LCD and viewfinder. It also feels cheap. A $5,100 camera should include a top-of-the-line EVF.\nThe viewfinder is not the only part of the RX1R III that left me confused about what Sony was thinking. There's the rear screen I just mentioned, which is both better and worse than the one before. On the one hand, it offers nearly double the resolution, thanks to its 2.36-million-dot panel. On the other hand, it's no longer articulating, which feels like a major step back since it makes shooting candid shots from the hip a lot harder. And forget about vlogging or taking selfies.\nSeparately, Sony hasn't weather-sealed the III. Again, that's a feature I'd like to see on such an expensive camera. Thankfully, battery life is improved, with the RX1R III supporting Sony's larger NP-FW50 batteries. I could comfortably get a day of shooting out of the latest model if I was good about powering off the camera when I wasn't using it.\nI could overlook all the complaints I mentioned if Sony had just added in-body image stabilization (IBIS). When I reviewed the Fujifilm X100VI last year, that feature alone felt transformational. More than just improving image quality, it made the X100VI into a camera that could shoot in nearly any light. I understand Sony likely wanted to keep the III small and light, but again, $5,100 is a lot to pay to not have a feature that many high-end cameras offer.\nWrap-up\nI've mentioned a few of the RX1R III’s competitors in passing, but now I think it makes sense to consider where Sony's new camera fits in the market. Most people shopping for a premium compact camera will probably start their search with the X100VI. If you can find one in stock, it's significantly cheaper than the RX1R III, coming in at $1,800. Sure, you're forgoing a full-frame sensor for a smaller APS-C sensor. But for most people, I think that's a fair tradeoff, especially when the X100VI also offers IBIS, an articulating screen, an optical viewfinder and Fujifilm's excellent color simulations.\nIf you want the largest possible sensor, I'd argue Fujifilm's GFX100RF, which has a medium-format 100MP sensor, makes more sense — even with all of its faults and a price increase coming at the end of the month. There are also the Leica Q3 and Q3 43 to consider. At $6,735 and $7,380 respectively, both are more expensive than the RX1R III, but come with nicer displays, IBIS and Leica glass.\nLike I said at the start, I wish the RX1R III was easier to recommend, but it occupies a strange space where it's not necessarily better or different enough from its rivals. Inflation and Trump's tariffs likely tied Sony's hands to a degree, but the company could have still made the new model more compelling by avoiding some of its questionable design decisions.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cameras/sony-rx1r-iii-review-waiting-10-years-to-be-underwhelmed-160036397.html?src=rss",

    "full_text": "In Star-Crossed World, the promise of a more difficult Kirby game reaches its conceptual limits. But how hard can a game built around pressing one button to obliterate the problems in front of you get? To keep things simple, almost every action that Kirby can take requires one button. Gear lets Kirby climb up walls, introducing entirely vertical platforming sections with a satisfying haptic feeling in the hand. Over five hours of gameplay, I was entertained by the new ideas and puzzles presented in these levels. Much like Link in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, closely evading an enemy’s attacks slows time, allowing Kirby to get hits in with vacuumed up stars or whatever copy ability is on hand. And it all feels balanced around revisiting my old, near 100 percent save with leveled-up copy abilities that resemble demigod-like powers. I mostly used my overpowered sword, which was drawn from the grim reaper that multiplies in size and crashes down with fiery tornadoes. Against even powered-up versions of basic bosses, it takes just two hits to deplete entire health bars. They also deal out enough blows that losing all of Kirby’s health becomes an inevitable threat."

    "summary": "Bose announced its latest earbuds in June, but the QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds (2nd gen) ($299) won’t arrive until early September. Today, though, they’re available for preorder, and I’ve spent the last few weeks testing all the new features. This model is an overhaul of the noise-canceling earbuds the company debuted in 2023 alongside its take on spatial audio. Among the upgrades, Bose has improved the active noise cancellation (ANC) performance, enhanced call quality and added wireless charging to the case. Two years later, the QuietComfort Ultra is still the best option for those primarily concerned with blocking distractions, and Bose’s tweaks make its best earbuds even better.\n \nWhat’s new on the QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds (2nd gen)?\nThe new QC Ultra Earbuds are at their best in Quiet mode. This is Bose’s option for full noise cancellation without spatial audio (or Immersive Audio, as the company calls it). Here, there’s no doubt these are still the best noise-cancelling earbuds available right now. The first-gen version achieved the same feat, but Bose has gone a step further to enhance its ANC setup for this refresh. \nSpecifically, the company updated the algorithm for its ActiveSense technology in Aware (transpancy) Mode. Now the QC Ultra Earbuds offer smoother changes in ANC levels to combat sudden spikes in ambient noise. This means things like sirens should no longer drown out your music or podcast. Unfortunately, I wasn’t able to trigger the retooled adaptive ANC with simulated police sirens from YouTube — the best option on my quiet cul-de-sac — but I’ll report back if I notice any oddities here.\nBose also upgraded call quality on the QC Ultra Earbuds. The company says a new AI-powered setup, known as SpeechClarity, works with “the earbuds’ eight microphones, dynamic mixing and adaptive filters” to focus on your voice. Bose explains that it uses audio augmentation tech that was originally developed for hearing aids here, which can reduce background noise like wind or the drone of an office. During my tests, the revised system silenced a noisy fan, rendering it completely absent from my recordings. However, overall voice quality suffers as you will sound a bit staticky when all the audio processing kicks in.\nThankfully, you no longer need an additional accessory for wireless charging on the QC Ultra Earbuds. With the first-gen model, you had to buy a separate cover to enable cable-free recharging. Bose has now built all of that into the case for the second-gen set, a welcome upgrade that really should’ve been here from the start. When the original QC Ultra Earbuds debuted in 2023, wireless charging was certainly already the norm.\nWhat’s still great about the QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds (2nd gen)?\n\n\n\n\n   Billy Steele for Engadget \n \n\nAs I mentioned, the overall ANC performance of the QC Ultra Earbuds remains unmatched. If you’re looking to block out distractions, this is the best option that still offers great sound quality. Bose even manages to cancel out human voices better than most of its rivals, which can be a struggle for much of the competition.\nAudio quality on these earbuds remains near the top of the heap. You won’t notice as much detail as Noble Audio’s FoKus Rex5 or Technics’ AZ100, but there’s great clarity here nonetheless. Bose says the tuning was “slightly refined” for improved bass response and smoother high frequencies. I noticed that tracks with deep bass, like Deftones’ “locked club,” are clearer at the low end. Meanwhile, treble-forward instruments in songs like Miles Davis’ “Green Haze” sound crisper and cleaner than before.\nDespite their larger size, this year’s buds offer a surprisingly balanced and comfortable fit. Bose refreshed the ear tips for the QC Ultra Earbuds with a new guard to prevent wax build up. Touch controls are still reliable, and you can disable them entirely on this second-gen version.\nWhat’s not so good about the QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds (2nd gen)?\nThe biggest gripe I have with the overhaul of the QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds is the lack of improvement to battery life. I was disappointed to see that a better runtime wasn’t part of the upgrades when I read the announcement in June, and I’m still not over it. On this model, you’ll get up to six hours of use with ANC turned on. Like before, if you listen with that spatial Immersive Audio enabled, that drops to four hours. A couple more hours would’ve been nice, enough to keep the QC Ultra Earbuds in place for a full work day without having to give them a lunch break in the case.\nWhile the design doesn’t bother me too much, I know the look of the QC Ultra Earbuds isn’t for everyone. There is a bit of a mini Bluetooth headset vibe going on here, and the overall size of the buds are on the larger side when much of the competition is racing to be the smallest. Like I said, none of this impacts comfort or stability, and I’d bet many prospective buyers are willing to live with the aesthetic in exchange for the type of silence the QC Ultra Earbuds deliver.\nWrap-up\nThe upgrades on the second-gen QC Ultra Earbuds don’t make for a wildly new product, but they do provide enough for a notable improvement over the previous version. ANC and call performance are both enhanced, and though it’s late to the party, the addition of built-in wireless charging is a welcome change. Other updates, like the tuning tweaks and the ability to turn off touch controls, are quality-of-life changes that undoubtedly improve the overall experience. Bose has done all of this without changing the price from the 2023 model, which is a surprising choice in the current economic climate. Simply put, the QC Ultra Earbuds remain the best option for wireless noise-cancelling earbuds, and that’s not likely to change anytime soon.\nThe Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds (2nd gen) are available for preorder in the US today, August 28. The general on-sale date is scheduled for September 10.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/bose-quietcomfort-ultra-earbuds-2nd-gen-review-still-a-noise-canceling-powerhouse-153017601.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Labor Day marks the unofficial end to summer as the weather starts to get crisper and students head back to school for the new semester. It also marks a good time to check out the tech deals available across the web. While seasonal holidays like Memorial Day and Labor Day are not the boon for tech sales that shopping events like Amazon Prime Day are, they can present good opportunities to save on things like laptops, tablets, smart home gear and more.Here, we've curated the best Labor Day sales on tech we could find this year. Since this time of year does overlap with the back-to-school season, students should be first in line to check out these deals. If you need some new gadgets for college, or refreshed tech to help you out in your first job after graduating, now's the time to see if you can get it for less. Student discounts are handy and exclusive to those who can prove their student status, but the good thing about Labor Day sales is that anyone can take advantage of them — student ID not required.\nBest Labor Day sales: Engadget's top picks\n \nApple MacBook Air (13-inch, M4) for $799 ($200 off): Apple's latest MacBook Air is the top pick in our guide to the best laptops, and it earned a score of 92 in our review. The M4 model isn't a major refresh overall, but that's not a bad thing — the design remains exceptionally thin, light and well-built, with long battery life and a top-notch keyboard and trackpad. Now it's a bit faster thanks to the updated chipset. \nApple iPad (11-inch, A16) for $299 ($50 off): Apple's entry-level iPad is, unsurprisingly, the best iPad option for those on a budget. It has solid performance thanks to the A16 chipset, 128GB of storage in the base model and good battery life.\nApple iPad Air (11-inch, M3) for $449 ($150 off): The latest iPad Air is a relatively minor update; the only big addition is a more powerful M3 chip. However, we still recommend this iPad over the base model in our iPad buying guide: Its display is more color-rich and better at fending off glare, its speakers are more robust, it works with Apple’s best accessories and its performance should hold up better in the years ahead.\nSony WH-CH520 wireless headphones for $38 (46 percent off): Sony makes headphones at all price ranges, and the WH-CH520 provides good sound quality and long battery life at an affordable price. They support custom EQ with Sony's mobile app, multipoint connectivity, a built-in microphone and up to 50 hours of battery life.\nAmazon Kindle Colorsoft (16GB) for $220 ($30 off): This is the latest version of Amazon's color ereader that has half of the storage of the original model, but otherwise functions the same. That makes it a little cheaper to start off, but you're still getting a 7-inch color e-paper display, full access to the Kindle shop and a waterproof design. We also appreciate that the Colorsoft comes with no lockscreen ads by default.\nGoogle Pixel 10 smartphone + $100 Amazon gift card for $799 ($100 off): More of a pre-order deal than a Labor Day deal, this bundle includes a free gift card when you order the latest Google Pixel phone in advance. You'll find different gift card deals at Amazon depending on which phone you go with: the Pixel 10 Pro and Pro XL have a $200 gift cards included, while the Pixel 10 Pro Fold comes with a free $300 gift card.\nEufy 11S Max robot vacuum for $159 (43 percent off): This model is one of our favorite budget robot vacuums thanks to its slim design that lets you get underneath furniture more easily and strong suction power for its size. Note that it does not have Wi-Fi connectivity, but it comes with a remote that lets you control the robot to your liking.\nShark AI Ultra robot vacuum for $298 (50 percent off): This Shark robot vacuum is a version of one of our favorites and it comes with a auto-empty base that can hold up to 60 days worth of debris. It has strong suction power and home mapping capabilities, so you can tailor cleaning jobs to your liking in addition to putting the robot on a cleaning schedule.\nDyson 360 Vis Nav robot vacuum for $500 ($500 off): Dyson made one of the most impressive robovacs with the 360 Vis Nav. It has some of the strongest suction power of any robot vacuum I've tried, and its impressive obstacle avoidance allows it to move around furniture and other objects with basically not intervention from humans necessary.\nBlink Outdoor 4 security cameras (3 camera system) for $100 (47 percent off): Some of our favorite security cameras, Blink Outdoor 4 devices support 1080p video, two-way talk, motion alerts and night vision. The most convenient thing about these is that they're totally wireless and run on AA batteries that can last up to two years before you need to replace them. That combined with their weather-proof design allows you to place them both inside and outside.\nCosori 9-in-1 air fryer for $90 (25 percent off): One of our picks for the best air fryers, this Cosori model has a spacious six-quart cooking basket and nine prep modes to choose from. In our testing, it consistently crisped up all kinds of foods, from frozen appetizers to raw proteins, and it has a nifty safety feature with its built-in basket release button.\nHORI Piranha Plant camera for Switch 2 for $40 (33 percent off): If you plan on taking advantage of the Switch 2's video and group chat feature, there's no cuter way to do it than with this Piranha Plant camera. In addition to using it with the pot as a stand, the plant itself detaches from the pot so you can use the camera in portable mode with the USB port on the new console.\nESPN Unlimited with Disney+ and Hulu (with ads) for $30/month ($6/month off): ESPN’s new streaming service is officially available now, and new subscribers can get Disney+ and Hulu included for one year when they sign up. The regular price of the new ESPN Unlimited plan is $30 per month, but this bundle offer throws in Disney+ and Hulu (with ads) for one year at no extra cost. If you want to break it down, you’re essentially getting each of the three services for $10 monthly with this offer.\nNordVPN deal — Get up to 77 percent off two-year plans: Most of NordVPN's two-year plans are on sale right now. You'll get 77 percent off the Prime tier, bringing the price down to $189 for 27 months of service (Nord throws in an extra three months for free). Arguably the best plan for most people is the Plus tier, which is 73 percent off and down to $108 for the 27-month term.\nMasterClass deal — Get 50 percent off one-year subscriptions: You can sign up for one year of MasterClass access for as low as $5 per month thanks to this sale that runs through September 1. A subscription lets you watch hundreds of online video classes taught by experts in their fields, and subject matter ranges from writing to cooking to sports.\nBest Labor Day sales on tech\n\nApple 24-inch iMac (M4) for $1,149 ($150 off)\n8Bitdo Ultimate 2C Wired Controller for $15 (25 percent off)\nXbox wireless gaming controller for $54 (17 percent off)\nRoku Ultra streamer for $79 (21 percent off)\nSony WH-1000XM4 wireless headphones for $198 (43 percent off)\nAnker Laptop Power Bank (25K, 100W) for $95 (30 percent off)\nGovee RGBIC Floor Lamp Basic for $60 (40 percent off)\nAmazon Fire Max 11 tablet for $175 (24 percent off)\nNothing Headphones (1) for $269 ($30 off)\n\nMore Labor Day sales\n\nAmazon Labor Day sale: Get up to 40 percent off headphones, earbuds, tech accessories and more\nBest Buy Labor Day sale: Get up to 50 percent off appliances, laptops, TVs, smartphones and more\nWalmart Labor Day sale: Save hundreds on electronics including TVs, laptops, headphones and more\nDyson Labor Day sale: Save up to $500 on vacuums, hair care and more\nSonos Labor Day sale: Save up to 25 percent on headphones and speakers\nTherabody Labor Day sale: Save up to $150 on percussion massage guns and more\nOoni Labor Day sale: Get 20 percent off the Koda 2 Max and save on other pizza ovens\nSolo Stove Labor Day sale: Get 20 percent off fire pits and 15 percent off select accessories\nMeater Labor Day sale: Get up to 27 percent off smart meat thermometers\n\nFollow @EngadgetDeals on X for the latest tech deals and buying advice.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-labor-day-sales-for-2025-get-up-to-50-percent-off-gear-from-apple-dyson-sony-and-others-120049238.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Here's how Apple's iPhone 17 lineup will differ when they launch on Sept. 9 -- at least according to the rumors we've heard.",
    "full_text": "Last year's iPhone 16 series added a handful of upgrades over its predecessors, most notably the new Camera Control key. Increased costs of imports mean Apple could raise iPhone price tags, with Jefferies analyst Edison Lee predicting a $50 price hike across the lineup aside from the base iPhone 17 model. If that's the case, then anticipated US starting prices could be as follows: iPhone 17: Camera bump redesign -- Rumors suggest that the square-shaped camera bump from prior years will give way to a vertical pill-shaped ovoid with the usual two cameras (main and ultrawide). And case-maker Dbrand is preselling an iPhone 17 Pro Tank case that shows off the wider camera bump as well. Another display rumor suggests that Apple will close a feature gap between the baseline and pro models by making all phones have a maximum 120Hz refresh rate (prior lineups have kept the cheaper phones at 60Hz). -- While not widely corroborated, one rumor suggests the Pro models will get an up to 8x zoom camera, up from the 5x telephoto found in last year's iPhone 16 Pro. iPhone 17 Pro Max: Improved zoom camera -- Likewise, the iPhone 17 Pro Max could get a better telephoto camera and keep its predecessor's 48-megapixel main and 48-megapixel ultrawide cameras. There's also no reason to believe Apple will switch up its storage options. The iPhone 17 Pro Max will likely only have 256GB, 512GB and 1TB options."

    "summary": "We're now less than two weeks away from the Apple iPhone 17 event. Themed \"Awe dropping\" this year, the event — confirmed after Apple sent \"save the date\" invitations to the media on August 26 — will be livestreamed on YouTube September 9 at 1PM ET from Cupertino. And Engadget staff will be there, reporting and liveblogging from Apple Park to give their hands-on impressions. This year is shaking up to be a departure from recent September product rollouts, with the strong possibility of an all-new superthin iPhone expected to join the company's lineup. Also on tap could be new Apple Watch models — including the first truly new Ultra model in two years — and (maybe) the long-awaited AirPods Pro 3.\nThat rumored thin iPhone — possibly called the iPhone Air — would be the newcomer of what's expected to be four new handsets this year. Expected to be roughly 5.55 mm thick, it would be the thinnest iPhone yet, besting 2014's iPhone 6 which, at 6.9 mm, was the previous svelteness champ. And they've only gotten chunkier since then. (The iPhone 16 Pro has a depth of 8.25 mm.) The Air would also give Apple a direct rival to Samsung's Galaxy S25 Edge, which we found to be more than a gimmick.\nBut the iPhone Air's thin design will likely lead to some compromises. It's rumored to have only a single 48 MP camera and a smaller battery. So, expect a stylish phone that... won't be for everyone.\nThis is the image that accompanied Apple's event invitations this year.Apple\nThe Pro lineup could offer some design tweaks and performance improvements. The iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max are rumored to switch from titanium to aluminum. They could also see the rear camera array expand to an entire \"island\" that extends across most of the phone's backside. It's expected to house three cameras (as before), but multiple rumors have suggested it will have an improved telephoto one. The zoom lens could jump to 48MP, which would strengthen its digital zooming / cropping chops. The phones may also add an anti-glare coating, similar to those found on iPads.\nThe standard iPhone 17 could see some welcome display upgrades. At least one supply chain source claimed it will add a 120Hz variable refresh rate (ProMotion) display, which the Pro series has used since 2021.\nApple\nOne thing we know without a doubt is that the new iPhones will launch with iOS 26, which brings Apple's biggest design refresh in years. It's easy to imagine the company highlighting the new model's displays as the best way to experience the new Liquid Glass visual language. As for the naming scheme, there haven't been any leaks pointing to a similar hardware rebranding (\"iPhone 26,\" \"iPhone 26 Pro,\" etc.). But hey, Apple does like surprises.\nEngadget's iPhone 17 rumor roundup gives you a deeper dive into what to expect from the new models.\nCherlynn Low for Engadget\nApple's fall event isn't just for iPhones. The company is also expected to roll out new Apple Watch models. 5G and a processor upgrade are expected for the Apple Watch Ultra 3. It may also let you send texts via satellite, handy for those who use it out in the wilderness. Regardless of the details, Apple hasn't launched a new rugged and premium model since 2023 (apart from a new color), so it's due for an upgrade.\nThe Series 11 model is unlikely to depart dramatically from the Series 10. After all, that model introduced a new design, with a thinner body and larger screen. (And Apple has historically kept those around in three-year cycles.). But a faster chip also seems logical. Perhaps we'll see 5G arrive on the standard wearable, too.\nWe may also see the AirPods Pro 3 at the event. It's been about three years since Apple last upgraded its premium earbuds. The new model could also bring some biometric sensors to the earphones: an in-ear heart-rate monitor and (maybe) temperature sensing. Live translation is also rumored, although that may not be exclusive to the third-gen model. But don't expect major design changes, if the latest reports from leaker Majin Bu (via MacRumors) are to be believed: In addition to a \"slight reduction in size,\" Bu notes the case will lose the physical pairing button, while gaining capacitive controls.\nWill there be other announcements? Time will tell, but now we know we won't have to wait long to find out. The official countdown clock has begun, and the answers are just days away.\nUpdate, August 28, 2025, 10:45AM ET: Added new report on AirPods 3 case details. \nUpdate, August 26, 2025, 5:41PM ET: Added confirmation of official event invitation, date and time. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/apples-iphone-17-awe-dropping-event-is-on-september-9--heres-what-we-expect-090059664.html?src=rss",

With the ESPN Unlimited subscription tossed in, you can stream live events for leagues like the NBA, NHL and NFL along with on-demand content on the app. Normally priced at $30 a month, the plan is an added money-saving perk with Fubo's package. DirecTV offers a comparable channel roster for its MySports subscription at $70 per month and Comcast's $70 Xfinity Sports & News TV bundle is also geared toward sports fans.

    "summary": "As soon as I picked up Honor’s Magic V5, I was a little concerned about its durability. The fourth generation of Honor’s Android foldable may not be massively thinner than its predecessor, but it sure feels like it. Yes, it’s built with aerospace-grade materials to make it sturdy despite its svelteness, but it’s also the first foldable I’d insist on buying a case for because goodness me, it’s thin.\nIf you recall, the last handset in this series was the Magic V3 and no, you haven’t fallen asleep and missed a year. The number four can represent bad luck in Chinese culture as its Cantonese form (sei) sounds almost identical to the word for death (séi). Consequently, we’ve skipped a model number.\nThe V5 is so svelte it’ll barely make an impression on your pants pocket, measuring 8.8mm folded and 4.1mm open. That’s not a big difference to the V3’s 9.2mm / 4.35mm, but it certainly feels like a rubicon has been crossed. It’s worth noting Honor is marking its own homework with one eye closed here, since it can only reach that thickness with the white V5. The other colorways (black, red and gold) stack up at 9mm / 4.2mm, which is almost the same as Samsung’s Z Fold 7.\nPhoto by Daniel Cooper for Engadget\nNaturally, a premium foldable deserves premium internals, and the V5 packs a Snapdragon 8 Elite with 16GB RAM and 512GB storage. There’s a 5,820mAh silicon carbon battery that, when paired with the company’s usual AI power-management tools, promises nearly 50 hours of life on a charge. I won’t comment on that claim but I can say this is the snappiest and fastest Honor foldable I’ve laid my eyes and hands on. There’s no lag or delay when switching displays, and everything feels like it’s already served up seconds before you’ve even asked for it.\nBut in the same way no modern smartphone is a dramatic departure from what went before, the rest of the story here is nips and tucks. The Magic V5 has the same 6.43-inch cover display as the V3, and the main screen has grown only slightly, from 7.92 inches to 7.95 inches. The only useful tweak is support for Honor’s MagicPen stylus on both screens, but it’s the same size as an Apple Pencil, so you’ll need to find a place to store it.\nPhoto by Daniel Cooper for Engadget\nIt’s a similar story of modest changes on the imaging front as the V5 is equipped with a 50-megapixel f/1.6 primary camera with OIS. That's paired with a 64-megapixel, f/2.5 periscope telephoto (also with OIS) and a 50-megapixel f/2.0 ultra-wide. Overall, that’s an improvement on the previous model, but both selfie cameras (in the cover and primary display) are the same 20-megapixel shooter found in the V3. Of course, performance is bolstered by the usual AI features that may or may not be useful.\nHonor has announced European pricing for the V5, with it costing €1,999 (around $2,317) in the EU and £1,699 (around $2,283) in the UK. That puts it in the same rough bracket as the Z Fold 7, although there's so many deals and discounts these days you can always save money if you look. I'm still not sure if Honor isn't selling itself short by not undercutting its rivals more aggressively, but it must feel it can compete, and win, against Samsung and the like on an even playing field. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/honors-magic-v5-foldable-almost-feels-too-thin-143022082.html?src=rss",

Honor doesn't sell its phones officially in the US, so for reference that UK price converts to $2,299. I'd have loved to see what a foldable phone felt like that was so slender the whole way across. The inner screen measures 7.95 inches and provides loads of room for videos or games. You'll also find the usual array of Google AI tools including Gemini Live and Circle to Search. But as with most book foldables, watching widescreen content results in a lot of wasted black space on the nearly square aspect ratio. But they can't quite challenge today's top camera phones like the iPhone 16 Pro or Galaxy S25 Ultra. Lovely crisp details and accurate colors on this image taken with the main camera. Its slim design alone makes it one of the more impressive foldable phones I've held. Sadly, I haven't had my hands on the Z Fold 7 so I can't say how the two phones compare, but on paper it seems like it's a close battle."

Honor is winning this race on a theoretical basis with its 8.8 mm (when folded) thick Magic V5 foldable. I’m saying theoretical because there is a huge, camera-bump-sized caveat to this. Apart from that, the phone is a solid piece of hardware. The front display is a 6.43-inch screen with 2376 x 1060 resolution, and the main (unfolded) display is a 7.95-inch screen with 2172 x 2352 pixels. The company said it’s using a carbon fiber reinforced inner panel for better fall protection. So far, I haven’t seen notable scratches on either screen. Honor has included a bunch of AI editing tools with the phone. There is an AI eraser that lets you draw on objects to remove them. I tested this feature with a French-speaking friend, and the results were very good."

If you want to limit your intake, it starts with cutting back on these eight high-risk items. How to avoid it: Drinking tap water from a stainless steel or glass container can reduce your risk of ingesting plastic particles. How to avoid it: Buying honey from local beekeepers who often use more natural and sustainable harvesting methods may reduce the risk of microplastic contamination. How to avoid it: Wash your fruit thoroughly, peel when possible and choose local or organic produce. To help address the overall issue of microplastics, you can install a filter in your clothes-washing machine. If you can afford it, a special filter will catch microfibers before they pollute water systems. We still have a lot to learn about microplastics and their long-term implications for our health when ingested. It might be hard to hear they're in so many of our foods but that shouldn't deter you from eating well."

    "summary": "DJI's busy engineering team is at it again with the creation of the company's third wireless mic system in less than two years. The new flagship DJI Mic 3 has a wholesale design change from the Mic 2 plus numerous improvements in areas like sound quality, noise reduction and the number of subjects you can record at once — though there is one downgrade compared to to the last model. I've had one for over a week so I'll provide some impressions as well.\nThe most noticeable change with the Mic 3 is the smaller transmitter size and lighter weight. It weighs just 16 grams (.58 ounces) compared to 28 grams (.99 ounces) for the Mic 2, though it's bigger and heavier than the Mic Mini transmitter (10 grams). DJI has also improved the transmitter mounting options, introducing a rotating clip along with the magnetic option. There's even a choice of five colors for the windscreen to better match your subject's clothing. \nThe smaller size and rotating clip makes the Mic 3 more discreet and easier to attach to any shirt or hat. However, there's still a large \"DJI\" logo on both sides of the transmitter that looks ugly but gives the company free advertising, I suppose. \n\n\n\n\n  Steve Dent for Engadget\n \n\nThe charging case holds a receiver and two transmitters and, unlike the last model, now lets you insert the transmitter with the magnetic mount and windscreen still attached. Fully charged transmitters can run for about eight hours and the receiver can go 10 hours. However, the case provides enough power to charge all three devices 2.4 times for about 28 hours of extended use. This feature makes the Mic 3 useful for marathon shoots and was key to the success of the original DJI Mic, though competitors like Sennheiser have caught on and introduced similar cases.\nThe Mic 3 now supports up to four transmitters and eight receivers at once. That means you can record four subjects at a time to as many as eight receivers simultaneously for multi-camera shoots (if you purchase the extra kits, of course). I wasn't able to test this feature as I had just a single kit, but it'll be handy for large jobs if it works as advertised. \nTo make syncing and lining up all that audio and video simpler, the Mic 3 now offers high-precision timecode capture embedded during internal recording. I tested this feature with two cameras, and once I figured out how to align the shots in DaVinci Resolve, it proved to be a valuable post-production timesaver.\n\n\n\n\n  DJI\n \n\nThe receiver can also be set to quadrophonic mode for select Sony cameras and software, allowing independent output of four channels at once to a single camera. DJI is promising a range of 400 meters (around 1,300 feet) and strong resistance to interference via automatic frequency hopping between the 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands.\nThere are some major improvements in audio quality as well. It's DJI's first microphone with two adaptive gain control modes. For noisy outdoor environments like sporting events, Automatic mode suppresses sudden volume spikes to prevent clipping. Dynamic mode, meanwhile, adjusts gain on the fly in response to volume changes to ensure consistent loudness in quieter settings like studios. \nI tested this feature in Paris in a relatively quiet studio and outside with traffic and other city noises. The Automatic setting did a good job suppressing those unwanted sounds without a noticeable impact on audio quality. And the dynamic mode kept my speaking levels steady even when I trailed off at the end of sentences, again without impacting voice timbre or clarity. \n\n\n\n\n  DJI\n \n\nThe Mic 3 is also DJI's first with three tone presets (Regular, Rich and Bright) to handle different voice characteristics (medium, low and high pitches). This feature also worked as advertised. Set to \"Regular,\" I needed less equalization than usual to even out my voice and it worked equally well on a higher-pitched female voice. \nTwo-level active noise cancelation reduces background sounds like air conditioning and wind noise. Again, this worked effectively, though like any noise reduction algorithm, it impacted voice quality by artificially reducing some frequencies. Finally, the lossless audio feature lets the mic send uncompressed 48kHz 24-bit audio directly to the receiver to eliminate any MPEG audio artifacts. This is likely overkill for most use cases. While the Mic 3 offers good sound quality, it's nowhere close to a dedicated high-end studio microphone — so you'll be hard pressed to notice any difference.\nDJI also added internal dual-file 24-bit and 32-bit float recording, which records the highest quality possible without any clipping. That allows you to capture two files of 32-bit float sound without algorithmic changes, two channels of 24-bit sound with algorithmic changes or one of each. That's an improvement over the Mic 2, which only captured a single file of the original sound internally in 32-bit float. \n\n\n\n\n  DJI\n \n\nThere's one key feature missing on DJI's Mic 3 that might make it a non-starter for some audio pros. Unlike the Mic 2, the transmitter lacks a 3.5mm mic port for wired lav or other microphones. That means you're relying on the Mic 3's built in microphone, and although it offers high quality sound, may not be high enough for applications like broadcast. \nFinally, the Mic 3 works with DJI's OsmoAudio system, so it pairs with the Osmo 360, Osmo Action 5 Pro, Action 4 and Osmo Pocket without the need for a receiver. I tested it with the Osmo 360 and Action 5 Pro and it connected without any issues. For other devices, you can wire it in via a 3.5mm TRS port, TRRS monitoring and a USB-C port, or to smartphones via Bluetooth or USB-C using the included adapter. \nDJI's Mic 3 is now on sale in most territories, priced at $329 in a kit with a charging case plus two transmitters and a receiver, or $219 with a single transmitter and receiver.\n\n\nUpdate, August 28, 2025, 9:45AM ET: This story was updated with US sales links. DJI originally said the Mic 3 wasn't available in the US yet, but the company changed course and the new product can be purchased from DJI or Amazon.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/djis-much-smaller-mic-3-can-record-four-subjects-at-once-120032192.html?src=rss",

You can grab it for $150 off at Amazon right now.\nThis deal applies to each configuration of the 11-inch and 13-inch versions of the most recent iPad Air. So, the 11-inch model is as low as $449, while the 13-inch model is down to $649. The same deals can be found at Best Buy and Target if you prefer to shop somewhere other than Amazon. This is an all-time low price and beats the deal we saw on Prime Day by $30. \n \nThe iPad Air M3 is more of an iterative refresh than a grand overhaul, but the spec bump means it’ll last you a long time before the tablet’s performance becomes a problem. This iPad occupies the position of \"best for most\" in our iPad buying guide, reinforcing that goldilocks analogy. The M3 chip is the main draw here, with Geekbench 6 scores proclaiming it around 16 percent more powerful than the M2 iPad Air, which is no slouch itself.\nBeyond the chip, it has a superior display and speakers to the entry-level model, and wider accessory support. You also get the option of a 13-inch display, which is great for artists or anyone who sees the iPad as a viable laptop replacement.\nIf there’s an obvious downside to the iPad Air M3, it’s that it doesn't have the nice 120Hz OLED display of the iPad Pro. This is hardly surprising, as Apple often focuses on display tech to differentiate its Pro and non-Pro devices, but it’s probably time the refresh rate on the middle-of-the-road iPad at least jumped up to ProMotion. Face ID is long overdue too. If you can live with these caveats, though, the iPad Air is an excellent option, particularly at this price.\nIf you think the Air is too much for your needs, the iPad A16, Apple's entry-level tablet, is down to $299 right now. It was slightly cheaper during Prime Day in July, but this discount is still worth considering if you're looking to pick up a newer iPad for less.\n \nCheck out our coverage of the best Apple deals for more discounts, and follow @EngadgetDeals on X for the latest tech deals and buying advice.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/apples-ipad-air-m3-gets-a-150-discount-for-labor-day-162908706.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "NVIDIA has revealed that its revenue for the second quarter ending on July 27 rose 56 percent compared to the same period last year, and that's without shipping any H20 chips to China. It reported a revenue of $46.7 billion and a net income of $26.4 billion. As CNBC has noted, the company previously said that H20 shipments to China could have added $8 billion in sales to its second quarter figures. Instead, the company was only able to release $180 million worth of the chips to a customer outside of China. NVIDIA clearly still did very well in the second quarter, however, just like in the previous ones. This is the ninth straight quarter, ever since AI skyrocketed in popularity back in 2023, wherein the company's year-on-year revenue increase has exceeded 50 percent. \nThe company designed the H20 specifically for the Chinese market, but the US government blocked its shipment earlier this year over concerns it could aid the nation's military. In mid-July, the government told NVIDIA that it will be able to ship the H20 to China again, but Chinese authorities discouraged local tech firms from using the chips. Now, the company is believed to be developing a new chip for China that's more advanced than the H20 and is based on the company's Blackwell architecture. Both the H20 and this upcoming more advanced chip could lead to another big leap in revenue and sales for the company. \nSpeaking of Blackwell, NVIDIA has also announced that sales for its Blackwell-based chips rose 17 percent from the first quarter. The new product line, which is designed for advanced AI, reached $27 billion in sales and represented 50 percent of the company's data center revenue. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/nvidia-is-really-profiting-from-the-ai-boom-133044352.html?src=rss",

The 16GB RAM/256GB SSD laptop is down to $799 from $999, which is the lowest price we've seen. You can upgrade to 512GB SSD for $999, down from $1,199, another all-time low price, or 24GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD for $1,199, down from $1,399. \n \nThen there's the 15-inch MacBook Air M4, whose cheapest model is on sale for $999, dropping from $1,199.

Then there's the 24GB upgrade, which is $1,399, down from $1,599.\nWe're big fans of the MacBook Air M4, giving it a 92 in our review. Part of that comes from an already lower starting price for the MacBooks than their predecessors. The 2025 models also get a speed boost thanks to the M4 chip and are very thin with a 0.44-inch thickness.

Plus, they both have excellent battery life, lasting over 18 hours while playing an HD video. \nThe big differences in the 15-inch model mostly come down to size.

Former Apple design visionary Jony Ive and OpenAI are working on their own AI-centric \"screenless phone\" concept. This third device from Plaud is an update to its original tabletop note-taking device (it also sells a wearable note taker) and comes with more powerful recording capabilities, along with a clutch of new features. That brings me to the big question hanging over the Note Pro, which is why would I carry a separate device to record my meetings when my phone is more than capable? Plaud CEO Nathan Xu laid out his vision for the Note Pro in a briefing, explaining why he thinks people would want to carry one themselves. There are other questions I still have about the Note Pro, largely based around privacy. Xu says Plaud's privacy protections are \"best in class,\" which it will need to be if it's capturing confidential and sensitive medical, legal or corporate discussions. A lesser, but still significant concern is how long it will take for me to lose the proprietary charging cable. The Note Pro is slimmer than a USB-C connector, so it's clear why having its own charging connector is necessary, but it may prove tricky to keep tabs on. I'll be updating this piece with my impressions as I get to grips with using the Note Pro, but if you just can't wait for that, it is available for preorder now for $179 (£169 or roughly AU$350) and will ship at some point in October."

The 2015 film from writer-director George Miller is set in a post-apocalyptic desert and is essentially a nonstop battle sequence where hero Max Rockatansky (Tom Hardy) teams up with Theron's Imperator Furiosa to wage battle against warlord Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne) and his army. David James/Paramount Pictures Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation (2015) Netflix just released the first five movies in the Mission: Impossible franchise and while we really enjoy them all, 2015's Rogue Nation is one of our favorites. After reconnecting, the two friends explore their friendship and wonder what might have been had Nora never left. Grug doesn't always welcome learning new things from a human and Eep's curious, sometimes rebellious ways also contribute to family disagreements. Taylour Paige, Colman Domingo and Glynn Turman co-star in the film that was adapted from August Wilson's 1982 play. Rustin's outspoken activism and homosexuality made him a target -- not just for political adversaries but sometimes even among his allies.

    "summary": "Early this summer, my wife and I had an inconvenient realization: we may need to be in two places at once. An urgent doctor appointment could conflict with YMCA day camp pickup, or our kids would get invited to two birthday parties on the same morning at godforsaken activity centers in separate towns. There was no doubt we needed another car. A big ticket purchase seemed unjustifiable when we don't know what eggs will cost next month — and my search for an aftermarket Prius within my budget was strangely fruitless. As it turns out though, now might be the best time to grab a used EV.\nDuring my search, I saw BMW i3s (those freakish go-kart looking EVs) and VW e-Golfs selling for around $15,000, both of which are more fun to drive and have better tech features than older Prii. Couple those low prices with the soon-to-be-expired EV tax credit — which can get you up to $4,000 off certain used EVs and plug-in hybrids (PHEVS) — and some cars could cost $10,000 or less! Meanwhile, I couldn't find a decent 2015 Prius below $17,000.\nLong story short, I settled on a boring-yet-secretly-fun option: A 2018 Nissan Leaf. It has a range of 150 miles and a hatchback design that looks less funky than the original bug-eyed sub-compact. It accelerates quickly, it's relatively engaging to drive and it also has premium leather seats, radar-assisted cruise control and a decent Bose speaker system. Not bad for something close to $15,000 with only 33,000 miles!\nEven though it's worth far less than our stately Volvo XC90, I genuinely have more fun zipping around town in the Nissan Leaf. There's the magic of the instant torque you get from its electric motor, the convenience of one-pedal driving (Nissan calls it \"e-pedal\") and its cherry red paint lets me pretend I'm having a mid-life Miata crisis like my middle school rhetoric teacher. Plus it can easily fit a large toddler car seat and a booster for my six-year old, and it has enough trunk space to deal with massive grocery hauls. Thank god I didn't get a Prius.\nDevindra Hardawar for Engadget\nWhy are used EVs so cheap?\nMany EVs just don't hold their value — you can blame the fast-evolving EV components and consumer uncertainty for that. But that also means you can find gently used models for far less than their list price. If I was less responsible and pushed my budget a bit higher, I'd absolutely consider a recent Hyundai Ioniq 5 for around $25,000. It's well-reviewed, and it looks like an '80s retro-future hatchback. What's not to love?\n(And yes, you could also look for used Teslas if you want. I can't vouch for the quality of that brand, and personally I wouldn't recommend getting stuck in its ecosystem.)\nYou can find even deeper discounts for less popular cars, like the Polestar 2 (which would honestly look great in my driveway next to its Volvo cousin). That luxury EV started at $61,000 at launch — but now it's easy to find used Polestar 2s for around $25,000.\nNo matter which used EV you're looking at, be sure to check out its battery health level. Most early EVs relied on air cooling for their batteries, and their chemistry isn't advanced as modern cars, which means degradation can be common. You can typically find a battery health indicator in a car's settings, but OBD sensors and apps like LeafSpy may provide a more accurate sense of their longevity.\n\nSo long, EV tax credit\nThe Biden-era EV tax credit can also shave off up to $4,000 from select used EVs and $7,500 from new models, but unfortunately thanks to Trump's \"Big Beautiful Bill\" it's likely to be discontinued at the end of September. I've seen some dealers highlight cars eligible for tax credits, and that's also true for online stores like Carvana. Just be sure to check the IRS requirements — notably, the new vehicle credit only applies for individuals earning less than $150,000 and married couples filing jointly who earn less than $300,000.\nThe used vehicle credit is even more restrictive, as it only applies to individuals earning less than $75,000 and married joint filers earning under $150,000. Additionally, qualifying EVs have to be priced under $25,000, and must be 2023 models or older. You'll also have to buy the used EV from a dealer — personal sales don't apply.\n\nHow I learned to deal with range anxiety\nOne major reason older EVs have gotten cheaper is that they often offer relatively low driving ranges. The 2021 BMW i3 can run up to 153 miles, but older models topped out at 85 miles (there are also Range Extender models that use a small gas engine to slowly recharge the battery). My 2018 Leaf tops out at 150 miles, but there are also \"Leaf Plus\" models that can reach up to 226 miles.\nThose numbers are a long way off from the 300-miles or so we expect from new EVs and gas cars, but I'd also argue the shorter range isn't a huge deal for many people. US DOT data tells us that 95 percent of trips in personal vehicles cover less than 31 miles, and the average driver travels 37 miles per day. That makes low-range EVs ideal as secondary vehicles for local driving.\nBetween day-care pickup, grabbing groceries and other local errands, I rarely drive more than 20 miles a day in my Leaf. That typically eats up only 10 to 15 percent of charge per day, depending on how much I need to blast the AC to deal with Georgia summers.\nNow I won't deny that you wouldn't want to go road tripping with a low-range EV, especially with America's messy charging infrastructure. Low-range EVs aren't for everyone. But if that's your worry, I'd just recommend avoiding the cheap sub-$15,000 used EVs. You'll find plenty of models with bigger batteries near $25,000.\nDevindra Hardawar for Engadget\nCharging might be easier than you think\nIf you can string a 25 foot power cord outside, you can easily Level 1 trickle charge an EV. And for moderate drivers, that may be all they need to keep their car juiced up. If I plug in my Nissan Leaf at 5PM, it can typically charge up by 40 percent by 8AM, thanks to its small battery. For larger EVs like the Kia EV9, I can usually get 10 to 15 percent of a charge overnight.\nOf course, things become more complicated if you're in your car all day and need faster charging, or if extreme weather causes your battery to drain faster than usual. At that point, you'll either have to seek out a public charging point, or get a Level 2 charger installed at home. Neither option is especially difficult, but they're more annoying than simply going to a gas station for a few minutes. I wouldn't be surprised if that's the big stumbling block pushing mainstream shoppers away from EVs.\nFrom what I've seen, though, many people are just hesitant to break their existing habits. If you have the ability to install a Level 2 charger in your garage, it's not especially difficult or expensive (though running an extra power line could be a big spend). And EV chargers are also popping up like weeds in shopping centers, so it may not be that tough to park up and charge while running errands.\nIn my case, I’m perfectly fine running a Level 1 charger to an outlet near my front door. That does mean I’ll occasionally have a thick electrical cord draped across my front porch (something I’m sure my wife just loves), but I can live with it for now. I do plan to get a Level 2 charger installed eventually though — it’ll make testing EVs a lot easier, and I can prepare myself for a more spacious family EV to replace our gas guzzling SUV.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/its-the-perfect-time-to-buy-a-cheap-used-ev-123015687.html?src=rss",

An urgent doctor appointment could conflict with YMCA day camp pickup, or our kids would get invited to two birthday parties on the same morning at godforsaken activity centers in separate towns. Even though it's worth far less than our stately Volvo XC90, I genuinely have more fun zipping around town in the Nissan Leaf. Many EVs just don't hold their value — you can blame the fast-evolving EV components and consumer uncertainty for that. You can find even deeper discounts for less popular cars, like the Polestar 2 (which would honestly look great in my driveway next to its Volvo cousin). No matter which used EV you're looking at, be sure to check out its battery health level. You'll also have to buy the used EV from a dealer — personal sales don't apply.

    "summary": "Streaming services keep raising prices. At this point, if you subscribe to all the major services out there, you're basically paying the same price as cable — those antiquated local monopolies that streaming was supposed to save us from. But streaming still has one big advantage over the old ways: no contracts. That means you can grab a good streaming deal and then cancel without penalty.\nOur advice is to sign up for a service when you see a good streaming deal (or the latest season of, say, Doctor Who, Severance, Andor and/or The Last of Us). Then, when the deal ends or you've binged whatever it is you want to watch, cancel as needed. But streaming deals don't come around all that often and, when they do, it's easy to miss them thanks to...everything. So we're keeping eyes out for the best streaming deals out there and we update this guide often — so check it out the next time you have a hankering to watch something new. \nBest streaming deals\nTrue streaming deals can be hard to come by. Most often, they’ll pop up during the Black Friday shopping period. On occasion, we’ll see them sparingly throughout the year and they usually take the form of a discounted monthly or annual rate for a limited period of time. Also, true streaming deals are typically on the ad-supported versions of a service, but once in a while you’ll find a unicorn of a deal on a tier that has ad-free viewing.\nIf you’re able to wait for a deal before subscribing to a streaming service, we recommend doing so. You’ll save money upfront and in the long run, and you also have the option to cancel your subscription before the price goes back up to the normal rate. Maybe you find you like the service so much that you’re fine paying full price for it — that’s the ideal situation. But if you’re not compelled to keep that app on rotation in your smart TV, most streaming services make it easy for you to cancel at any time. With that said, these are the best streaming deals you can snag right now.\n\n\nDirecTV starting at $50/month for one month ($35 off): All of DirecTV's signature packages are $35 off right now for your first month when you sign up. If you opt for the base \"Entertainment\" package, you'll spend $50 for the first month and get access to over 90 channels, including many local stations as well as ESPN, ESPN 2 and Fox Sports 1. You'll also be able to watch on the go with the DirecTV mobile app.\nDashPass Annual + HBO Max (with ads) for $96/year ($144 off): This offer includes access to HBO Max with ads for no extra cost when you sign up for a DashPass Annual plan. You can then decide to upgrade to Max Standard, which removes ads, for a discounted rate of $11 monthly if you want. Aside from the obvious streaming benefits, this deal gives you $0 deliver fees and lower service fees on some restaurant DoorDash orders, five percent DoorDash credits on pickup orders, on-demand grocery delivery and other members-only exclusives.\nSpotify Premium Individual (3 month) for $0 ($36 off): This is our favorite music streaming service for podcasts and social features. Right now, users who have not signed up for Spotify's Premium service before are eligible to get three months for free. The Premium Individual plan lets you listen ad-free and skip songs at will. You can also organize your listening queue and download content for offline listening. Just be aware, your subscription will auto-renew at the end of the trial period. So if you don't want to be on the hook for the $12 monthly fee, set a reminder to cancel and go back to the free version.\nFubo Pro for $55/month for the first month ($30 off): Fubo has introductory discounts on most of its packages, and the Pro package is the least expensive plan currently listed. It offers access to 224 channels, unlimited cloud DVR and up to 10 simultaneous streams. It even includes regional sports content from the NHL, MLB and NBA.\nYouTube TV (three months) for $150 ($99 off): You can get three months of our favorite live TV streaming service for $50 per month. That should give you a decent chunk of time to see if the service is right for you while saving some cash. The discount and trial are only open to new subscribers to YouTube TV’s base plan, which includes access to over 100 channels, unlimited DVR space and six household accounts with the ability to stream on three devices at once. \nSling Orange for $23/month for the first month (50 percent off): New customers can get Sling Orange or Sling Blue for half off the usual price for the first month, bringing the final prices to $23/month and $25.50/month, respectively. Orange is likely best for sports fans, with eight exclusive sports and family channels, while Blue includes 19 exclusive news and entertainment channels. You can get both Orange and Blue access also for half off for one month, or $33 total.\nPeacock first responders discount — one year for $48 (50 percent off): Medical professionals and first responders can save 50 percent each year of Peacock. The deal requires annual verification and is open to those who work for either private or public institutions. Peacock has some great stuff to watch, including Poker Face and Killing It and more.\nStudent discounts on streaming services\nHBO Max student discount — subscribe for $5/month (50 percent off): HBO Max offers their ad-supported tier to students for half off the usual rate. You’ll just have to verify that you’re a student through Unidays, and make note that this offer is only good for up to 12 months of service.\nHulu student discount — subscribe for $2/month (75 percent off): Those with a valid student ID can get Hulu’s ad-supported tier for 75 percent off the typical rate. They’ll keep the same sale price for as long as they’re a student as well.\nSpotify student discount — Premium + Hulu with ads for $6/month (72 percent off): Spotify’s student offer continues to be one of the best around, giving you access to the Premium tier of the music streamer and Hulu’s ad-supported plan for only $6 monthly. Purchased separately, you’d pay $22 per month for both of the services. Plus, the first month is free when you sign up.\nNBA League Pass student discount — one year for $120 (40 percent off): Students can get one year of League Pass for only $10 per month, which includes access to NBA TV and the ability to watch classic and archive games on-demand. On the NBA League Pass website, look for the student discount banner at the top and follow the instructions to verify your student status.\nStreaming bundle discounts\nThere’s more consolidation happening now than ever before in the streaming space, and that means there are more streaming bundle options. These bundles offer you access to more content with one subscription price, but those prices are typically higher than paying for a single service by itself (obviously). It may be tempting to just get the bundle, but if only one of those services in the bundle speaks to you, you’ll spend less overall by just paying for the single service.\nSpeaking of a deep love for a single streaming service: if all of your favorite shows are on Peacock or the latest releases on HBO Max consistently bring you joy, consider paying for one year upfront. Subscribing with an annual plan usually saves you money in the long term over paying on a monthly basis. Unfortunately, not all streaming services (looking at you, Netflix) have an annual subscription option. Here are some of the best streaming bundles you can get right now.\n\n\nDisney+, Hulu, HBO Max bundle with ads for $17/month: Ad-supported HBO Max is included here, along with full, ad-supported access to Disney+ and Hulu. You’ll save 43 percent with this bundle, as opposed to paying for all three services individually.\nDisney+ and Hulu Bundle Premium for $20/month: Disney and Hulu offer a few different bundles, which you can view in the drop-down lists under Choose Your Plan. This bundle removes the ads from both Disney+ and Hulu (with the exception of select live and linear content) and allows you to download content for offline viewing. You’ll save 42 percent with this bundle, as opposed to paying for both ad-free tiers individually.\nHulu + Live TV with Disney+ and ESPN+ for $96/month: This streaming bundle amalgamation is a bit confusing but it does offer a lot: you get live TV streaming via Hulu’s service plus access to the following VOD services: Hulu, Disney+ and ESPN+. Out of those three, only ESPN+ will have ads.\nDisney+, Hulu, ESPN+ Bundle Basic for $17/month: You get full access to Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+ content with this package, albeit with ads across the board. This bundle price is 46 percent off the total price of all three separate subscriptions.\nDisney+, Hulu, ESPN+ Bundle Premium for $27/month: Similarly to the Duo bundles, the Premium version of the Trio removes ads from most content in Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+, and you can download content for offline viewing. This price represents a 43-percent savings when compared to paying for all three ad-free tiers separately.\nSling TV + HBO Max starting at $53/month: Sling TV and HBO Max have partnered on a discount that gives new subscribers 50 percent off their first month of Sling TV, plus $5 off monthly when you subscribe to the Sling TV + HBO Max bundle. The standard price for the Sling Blue + HBO Max duo is roughly $58/month, so you'll get a monthly discount of $5 off that. In addition, for the first month only, you'll get half off the price of the bundle. The promotion also applies to the Sling Orange & Blue + HBO Max package, which has a standard price of $73/month.\nParamount+ with Showtime for $13/month or $120/year: This includes everything in Paramount+’s Essential plan, except the ads, and also provides access to Showtime content, live CBS streams and download features.\nRead more streaming coverage\n\nThe best live TV streaming services to cut cable\nThe best streaming services: Netflix, Hulu, HBO Max and more\nThe best streaming devices\n\nFollow @EngadgetDeals on X for the latest tech deals and buying advice.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/best-streaming-service-deals-133028980.html?src=rss",

This thing can pull up dirt like a beast. We said it had the strongest suction power of any robovac we've tested and easily took out pet fur from a carpeted floor. We also noted in our official review that the power here was on par with Dyson's stick vacuums. \n\n\nThe unit includes a stellar obstacle avoidance system, with cameras and LED lights to help the vacuum navigate around furniture. During our testing we found it to be nearly flawless, as it only crashed into a chair leg a couple of times. Also, we never received any alerts that the robot got stuck somewhere while working.\nThe bin here is on the larger side, but there's no self-emptying base. This is also not a hybrid unit. It's a vacuum and not a mop. This made it tough to recommend the unit at $1,000, despite the fantastic suction, but $500 makes it a whole lot easier.\nThe Dyson V15s Detect Submarine is also down to $800 as part of this sale, which is a discount of $200.

One of the more intriguing Ultra 3 rumors comes from Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, who has reported that Apple is exploring satellite connectivity for the next Apple Watch Ultra model. This would enable emergency messaging and location sharing even in areas without cellular coverage. If implemented, it could build on the Apple Watch's existing lineup of potentially life-saving features like emergency SOS, fall detection and car crash detection to outdoor enthusiasts going off the grid or even people who live in remote areas. Gurman's report also suggests the Ultra may gain 5G connectivity, a step up from its current LTE-only support. This would build on Apple's recently announced AI powered Workout Buddy which delivers personalized motivation for certain workouts with Watch OS 26. The Ultra's durability and long battery life could make it an ideal platform for round-the-clock training guidance, though based on current rumors, the rollout may be better aligned with a 2026 release. If the pattern holds, preorders should begin a few days after the keynote and arrive in stores (or at your doorstep) one to two weeks after that."

    "summary": "Commentary: While eSIM has its kinks, changes at the wireless carriers and with Apple's iOS might bode well for Google's new phone.",
    "full_text": "While I was initially concerned that an eSIM-only phone might be a frustrating roadblock for the Pixel 10, several advances in how the US carriers support eSIM, along with a new iOS 26 feature, might actually make it easier than ever to switch your phone. In an ideal world, changing an eSIM from one phone to another should be as simple as a couple of taps during your new phone's setup process. My former colleague Lisa Eadicicco reported losing access to MMS during her own eSIM swap between an iPhone and Android, also on Verizon. According to a Reddit post spotted by MacRumors, this new feature would generate a QR code that can be scanned on an Android phone to start the transfer. Apple and Google didn't respond to a request for comment about these eSIM transfer tools. While the most ideal method is to not involve your carrier at all -- even opening my T-Life app for T-Mobile shoves multiple sponsored offers in my face -- it's a relief that eSIM exchanges won't require tapping through a customer service phone call in order to get a representative. All three carriers and other retailers can help program phones with eSIMs as part of the purchase. Internationally, the Pixel 10 series will continue to have a physical SIM slot. International travel in particular could require some advanced planning, as you won't always be able to buy a prepaid SIM card to install it for temporary service. That's long been the method in other countries for buying a short-term prepaid cellular plan, and depending on where you're going, setting up service with eSIM might not be as accessible."

It provides 40 pounds of pressure and has five built-in speeds, ranging from 1,750 to 2,400 percussions per minute. It also has an amplitude of 16 millimeters, which gets deeper into the muscles. It also lets you access preset guided routines from the Therabody app (available for iPhone and Android) in case you need help getting started with your massage gun. Once turned on, I liked that the Elite has a screen that indicates its current speed setting and remaining battery. Physical therapists who use massage guns in their practice may find this massage gun to be a good option to have on hand for their patients. Who shouldn’t buy it: My one gripe with the Elite is that it's supposed to be one of Theragun's quieter massage gun models, but I still thought it was on the louder side, especially as you amp up the power. It also has a shorter battery life (120 minutes) than the other guns on this list and isn’t ideal to carry with you when you’re traveling since it isn’t compact. If you want to be able to carry your massage gun everywhere, then I would recommend one that is smaller, like the Theragun Mini or Ekrin Athletics Bantam. Editors' note: The Theragun Elite has since been discontinued, and this page will be updated as we re-test massage guns."

    "full_text": "It would allow Apple to capitalize on the skinny phone hype while also diverting attention from its fledgling AI efforts. It might also help to silence critics who say the iPhone's design has become too predictable in recent years – though consumers don't seem to be demanding skinny phones as much as other attributes, like better cameras and longer battery life. \"Slimness is a factor that can be clearly marketed, unlike uncertain use cases for AI.\" Charging more for an innovative design could be a more straightforward pitch than trying to monetize a phone's AI features, especially since platforms like Gemini and ChatGPT have free tiers -- and the smarter, Apple Intelligence-powered Siri that Apple promised in 2024 has yet to arrive. But there might be more to Apple's long-term plan than simply releasing a slimmer iPhone 17. She adds that minimizing the screen's crease (which Apple is reportedly doing in partnership with Samsung Display) can help it stand out. If Apple debuts a foldable next year, it could also be thin to compete with phones like the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7. Still, Apple quickly dominated those spaces -- and it's possible the rollout of a foldable iPhone could follow suit. It also faces mounting pressure due to its slower rollout of Apple Intelligence, which is still leagues behind what competitors like Samsung and Google have loaded onto their devices. Foldables remain a niche category, and Apple's entry could give the form factor a significant boost, thanks to the company's scores of loyal fans and its tendency to usher innovation into well-established categories."

For instance, Sega released Sonic Dream Team in 2023 on Apple Arcade to largely positive reviews. While streaming exclusives are common on video services like Netflix and Amazon Prime, for gaming it's not ideal for me to only be able to access a title while I have an active subscription.

Prohibiting electronic access to your SSN may feel inconvenient and extreme.

You can contact the SSA at 1-800-772-1213 between 8 a.m. and 7 p.m. local time, Monday through Friday. You can also create a MyE-Verify online account to lock your SSN and use the service's self-lock feature. This resource comes in handy because many employers use E-Verify, a service administered by SSA and the US Citizenship and Immigration Services, to check your employment eligibility. For added protection against tax identity theft, you can create an identity protection pin with the IRS to prevent someone else from filing a tax return with your SSN or individual taxpayer identification number.

    "summary": "If your Wi-Fi signal is struggling to reach every corner of your home, a signal booster — also known as a Wi-Fi extender — might be the fix you need. Whether you're dealing with annoying dead zones, buffering video calls or laggy gaming sessions, the right Wi-Fi extender can help expand coverage and improve connectivity without forcing you to move your router.There are different types of Wi-Fi extenders to choose from. Some models use external antennas to push the signal farther, while others, like mesh extenders, create a seamless, whole-home network. If you're simply looking to extend coverage into a specific room, a Wi-Fi repeater can do the job — but it may cut your bandwidth in half. More advanced extenders, however, can help maintain strong speeds and reliability throughout your home.We've rounded up the best Wi-Fi extenders to suit different needs, whether you're looking for an affordable fix or a high-performance upgrade.\nTable of contents\n\nBest Wi-Fi extender for 2025\nHow do Wi-Fi extenders work?\nWhat to look for in a Wi-Fi extender\nWi-Fi extender FAQs\n\nBest Wi-Fi extender for 2025\n \n \n \nHow do Wi-Fi extenders work?\nThese handy wireless devices do exactly what their name suggests: extend your Wi-Fi network so it covers more areas of your home. Most wireless extenders plug into an AC outlet and connect to your existing router so they can then rebroadcast it to spots that your router alone may not cover well. As a rule of thumb, you’ll get the best results by placing the extender half way between your router and the dead zone you’re trying to fix or improve your W-Fi connection and strengthen the wireless signal. \nOne important thing to note about Wi-Fi range extenders (also sometimes called “repeaters”) is that most of them actually create a new Wi-Fi network when rebroadcasting your existing one. That network will have a new name (it’ll often be your default network’s name with an EXT appended at the end, unless you change it) and that means you’ll have to connect to different networks when in different parts of your home. While that’s a small tradeoff in return for improved internet connection, some will be more inconvenienced than others.\nIf you’d rather have one, much larger network in your home, you’re better off upgrading to mesh networking systems. Mesh systems come with a main router and a wireless access point or two that, by default, create one large Wi-Fi system that should be accessible throughout your whole home. They tend to be the best Wi-Fi routers you can get, but that also translates to more expensive, and possibly more complicated, devices. Mesh Wi-Fi systems are, by far, more costly than a simple extender, plus you may have to work with your internet service provider to get your home’s existing network working on your new router.\nWhat to look for in a Wi-Fi extender\nSpeed\nExtenders today can support single, dual or tri-band Wi-Fi, and they will tell you the maximum speeds they support on all of their available bands. For example, one dual-band device might support 600Mbps speeds over its 2.4GHz band and up to 1300Mbps over its 5GHz band, for a combined maximum speed of 1900Mbps. For the best performance, you’ll want to go with a Wi-Fi extender that has the highest speeds possible (and those, as you might expect, tend to cost more). Some extenders even support Wi-Fi 7, giving you the latest in wireless technology for higher bandwidth, faster internet speed and lower latency.\nHowever, it’s important to remember that Wi-Fi extenders are not true “signal boosters” since they are not designed to increase speeds across your home. In fact, you may find that the extender’s network is slower than your router’s. Instead, extenders are designed to increase the strong Wi-Fi coverage throughout your home, making them ideal for filling in dead zones. Some mesh extenders can help create a more seamless network, reducing the drop in speed and improving connectivity in larger spaces.\nRange, and number of supported devices\nWith the name of the gaming being coverage area, taking note of a device’s range is important. Depending on the size of your home and property, you may only need up to 1,200 square feet of coverage. But those with larger homes will want to spring for an extender that can support upwards of 2,000+ square feet of coverage.\nSimilarly, those with lots of gadgets will want an extender that can handle them all at once. If you spend most of your time on your phone or laptop and maybe have your smart TV online for a few hours of Netflix each day, you could get by with a more limited extender. Smart home aficionados and tech lovers should invest in one that won’t buckle under the pressure of a few dozen connected devices. This is especially important if you plan on linking all of the devices in a certain part of your home to your Wi-Fi range extender’s network, rather than directly to your existing router. Some models with external antennas can improve performance by providing stronger, more directional wireless signal.\nDesign\nThere isn’t a ton of innovation when it comes to design in the Wi-Fi extender space. Most of the ones you’ll find today are rounded rectangles roughly the size of your hand that plug into a standard wall outlet. They usually have a few indicator lights that will show you when the extender is connected, how strong its signal strength is and when there’s a problem, and some will even have moveable external antennas that companies claim provide even better Wi-Fi signal. Generally, they are pretty simple to install and get connected, but if you’re struggling with how to set up your Wi-Fi extender, there are plenty of YouTube videos you can check out.\nAside from that, there are the scant few standalone Wi-Fi extenders that sit on an end table or a desk, and those look pretty similar to regular ol’ routers. But make no mistake, anything labeled as an extender or a “Wi-Fi repeater” will need an anchor router in order for it to work.\nAnother convenient feature you’ll find on most Wi-Fi extenders is an extra Ethernet connection port (or a few). This allows you to use the extender as a wireless access point if you connect it to your existing router, or an adapter to provide devices like TVs, smart home hubs or game consoles a hardwired connection to the internet. Unsurprisingly, this wired connection usually provides you with the fastest speeds possible, so you may want to use it for your most crucial devices.\nWi-Fi extender FAQs\nWhat's the difference between a wifi booster and extender?\nNowadays, there’s really no difference between a Wi-Fi booster and Wi-Fi extender - they’re just different names for the same thing. Previously, however, Wi-Fi boosters were devices that received signals from wireless routers, broadcasting them to another network. This essentially extends the range of the signal. Wi-Fi extenders expand the coverage within your home’s Wi-Fi network, but often you will see extenders described as boosters.\nIs a Wi-Fi extender better than a mesh router?\nMesh routers, or mesh Wi-Fi systems, use multiple devices (or nodes) across your home to create a larger home network. Essentially, you have multiple routers around your home with these systems, and that will hopefully provide the best coverage possible. Wi-Fi extenders, on the other hand, are usually just one device that extends your existing Wi-Fi signal, and they often require you to switch networks when connecting. Wi-Fi extenders are more affordable, though, and are great if you’re traveling or need a Wi-Fi signal in harder-to-reach areas. However, a mesh router can offer a better long-term solution to upgrade your entire home’s Wi-Fi.\nShould I use multiple Wi-Fi extenders?\nSome people may need to use multiple Wi-Fi extenders, for instance, if your home is large or has dead zones in different areas. But if you do use multiple Wi-Fi extenders, there’s a chance of interference. You may also need to manually connect to the extenders separately, which isn’t always convenient.\nWhat is the maximum distance for a Wi-Fi extender?\nThe maximum distance for a Wi-Fi extender varies depending on the model, but most can effectively extend your wireless signal between 800 and 2,500 square feet. Some high-end models may reach even farther, especially if they feature external antennas or are part of a mesh system with additional dedicated wireless access points.\nHowever, keep in mind that real-world performance depends on factors like your home's layout, wall materials and interference from other devices. For best results, place your extender about halfway between your router and the area with weak or no Wi-Fi connection. Always check the manufacturer’s specs — some of our top picks clearly list their expected range so you can find one that fits your space.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/best-wifi-extender-130021313.html?src=rss",

Only our top pick (see below) got close to my router’s standard speeds, but I expected this.

    "summary": "Figuring out the best iPad for you can be tricky. Apple now sells three 11-inch tablets and two 13-inch ones, each with key differences in pricing, specs and accessory support. The iPad mini is still hanging around, too. Ahead of the big changes coming with the iPadOS 26 update later this year, we’ve tested each current iPad and broken down which ones best fit different needs, whether you want a laptop replacement or just a big screen for streaming.\nTable of contents\n\nThe best iPads for 2025\nHow we test the best iPads\niPad FAQs\nRecent updates\n\nThe best iPads for 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow we test the best iPads\n\n\n\n  The top edge of the iPad mini.\n \n\n  Photo by Nathan Ingraham / Engadget\n \n\nMuch like we do for our guide to the best tablets overall, we spend several days with each iPad to see how they feel and perform with different tasks: watching videos, web browsing, playing both casual and graphically intense games, editing 4K photos and video, running multiple apps side-by-side, making FaceTime calls and the like. To better measure performance specifically, we use benchmarking tests like Geekbench 6, 3DMark and GFXBench Metal, plus we measure how long it takes for each tablet to boot up and open various apps. We also check how well each tablet holds up long-term, whether it’s with a review unit provided by Apple or an iPad model that’s owned by a member of the Engadget staff. \nTo help compare the color performance and brightness of the displays, we play the same videos on different iPads, side-by-side, at equal brightness levels. We use each tablet in direct sunlight outdoors to see how well they hold up to glare, and we play a handful of the same musical tracks to evaluate speaker performance. For battery life, we keep track of how long each tablet generally lasts before it needs a recharge, but we also play a 1080p movie on a loop at roughly 70 percent brightness with power-sapping background processes off. We also test each device with an Apple Pencil and note how responsive the stylus feels. Finally, we carefully pore over spec sheets and software updates to keep track of which features are available on certain iPads but not others.\niPad FAQs\n\n\n\n  The iPad (A16) on top of an 13-inch iPad Air.\n \n\n  Jeff Dunn for Engadget\n \n\nWhat are some new features coming to iPadOS 26?\nApple first previewed iPadOS 26 during its WWDC keynote in June. The update looks to be a major overhaul, one that brings iPadOS closer to macOS than ever before. New features include the ability to open more windows simultaneously and resize or tile them more freely; a Mac-style Menu bar; a dedicated Preview app; an upgraded Files app; an improved ability to export or download large files in the background; an Exposé view that shows all open windows; a pointier cursor and the option to add folders to the Dock. It’ll also use the new “liquid glass” design language Apple is rolling out across all of its platforms in 2025. Importantly, Apple says these features will be available across its tablet lineup, from the iPad Pro to the entry-level iPad. That could make the latter a particularly enticing value. You can find the full list of compatible devices at the bottom of Apple’s press release.\nHow long do iPads typically last?\nIf history is any indication, expect Apple to update your iPad to the latest version of iPadOS for at least five years, if not longer. The current iPadOS 18 update, for example, is available on iPad Pro models dating back to 2018 and other iPads dating back to 2019. How long your iPad’s hardware will last depends on which model you buy and how well you maintain it. (If you’re particularly clumsy, consider an iPad case.) A more powerful iPad Pro will feel fast for a longer time than an entry-level iPad, but each model should remain at least serviceable until Apple stops updating it, at minimum.\nWhat’s the difference between the iPad and the iPad Air?\nCompared to the 11th-gen iPad, the iPad Air runs on a stronger M3 chip (instead of the A16 Bionic) and has 2GB more RAM (8GB total). Both come with 128GB of storage by default. The Air is also available in two sizes, 11 and 13 inches, whereas the 11th-gen iPad doesn't offer the larger screen option. The M-series SoC gives the Air better long-term performance, plus access to certain iPadOS features such as Apple Intelligence and Stage Manager. Its display supports a wider P3 color gamut, has an antireflective coating and is fully laminated. The latter means there’s no “air gap” between the display and the glass covering it, so it feels more like you’re directly touching what’s on screen instead of interacting with an image below the glass. The Air also works with the newer Pencil Pro stylus and more comfortable Magic Keyboards, and its USB-C port supports faster data transfer speeds. It technically supports faster Wi-Fi 6E, too, while the lower-cost iPad uses Wi-Fi 6.  \nStarting at $349, the 11th-gen iPad is $250 less expensive than the iPad Air. It has a similarly elegant design with flat edges, thin bezels, USB-C port, and a Touch ID reader. Battery life is rated at the same 10 hours, and both devices have their front-facing camera on their long edge, which is a more natural position for video calls. The cheaper iPad works with the first-gen and USB-C Apple Pencils – which are more convoluted to charge – and a unique keyboard accessory called the Magic Keyboard Folio.\n\n\n\n\n  Jeff Dunn for Engadget\n \n\nWhat’s the difference between iPads and Android tablets?\nThe operating system, duh. But to give a few more specifics: Android devices are available from more manufacturers and cover a wider price range. You won’t see an $80 iPad anytime soon. Android is also more malleable in that you can easily sideload apps from places beyond Google’s official app store and more extensively customize the look of the OS. Several Android tablets still have features like a headphone jack or a microSD slot for adding storage, too, though those are getting rarer.\nBut we tend to recommend Apple tablets to those who have no allegiance either way. iPad apps are still a bit more likely to be designed specifically for larger screens, rather than looking like blown-up phone software, and Apple is just about peerless when it comes to long-term software support. Every new iPad hits a certain baseline of hardware quality and performance — none of them feel cheap, and all of them are fast enough for most needs. Plus, you’ll get the most out of an iPad if you use other Apple devices.\nCan an iPad replace a laptop?\nThis is a loaded question, since laptop workflows differ from person to person. If you mostly use a notebook for browsing the web, watching videos or writing emails and word docs, then sure, you can get along just fine with an iPad and the right iPad accessories. It’ll be easier to carry around, the battery life is great and having the touchscreen and stylus support is handy (though many Windows users have that regardless). Even beyond the basics, plenty of media editors, graphic designers and digital artists have shown they can get things done on an iPad.\nBroadly speaking, though, a laptop OS tends to be more flexible when it comes to file management, multitasking, coding or other “heavy” tasks. Safari on the iPad isn’t quite on par with desktop browsers either. So the answer really depends on you. That said, the iPadOS 26 update could close the gap, so check back on this in a couple of months.\nHow do I take a screenshot on an iPad?\nAs we note in our screenshot how-to guide, you can take a screenshot on your iPad by pressing the top button and either volume button at the same time. If you have an older iPad with a Home button, simultaneously press the top button and the Home button instead.\nRecent updates\nAugust 2025: We've taken another sweep to ensure our picks are still accurate and added a few more notes to our FAQ section.\nJune 2025: We’ve made a few minor edits to reflect the announcement of Apple’s latest iPadOS update, which we detail above.\nMay 2025: We’ve lightly edited this guide to ensure all details and links are still correct. We’re also keeping an eye on how the Trump administration’s tariff policy affects the pricing and stock of the iPad lineup (and every other tech category). All of our picks are still available at normal prices today, but we’ll update this guide if that changes.\nMarch 2025: We've reviewed the iPad (A16) and named it our new budget pick, removing the discontinued 10th-gen iPad in the process. \nMarch 2025: The recently-launched iPad Air M3 has replaced its predecessor as our top overall recommendation. We’ve also made a note regarding the new iPad (A16), which we plan to test in the near future and expect to become our new budget pick.

    "summary": "Apple on Tuesday finally announced that its iPhone 17 event will take place on Tuesday, September 9. So in just under two weeks, we'll get to take a first look at the new iPhone 17 lineup. If Apple keeps with tradition, expect to see iOS 26 available for download about one week after the event. If you can't wait any longer, you can download and install the newly released public beta 5 (or iOS 26 developer beta 8 for developers). I've been playing around with it for the past couple of weeks, and have found that taking screenshots is way better in the new operating system, as well as getting to choose how long you snooze. You can see a more complete view of the new features in our preview of the iOS 26 public beta release, which shows off the fresh home and lock screen redesign. Called Liquid Glass, the translucent look will extend across all of Apple's upcoming operating systems. The overhaul is one of several big changes coming to iOS, macOS, iPadOS and the rest of Apple's software suite, all of which were showcased during the company's WWDC keynote on June 9.\nAfter overpromising on AI plans last year, Apple kept its iOS roadmap focused more on basic quality of life improvements this year. There are multiple useful additions coming to the Phone and Messages apps on your iPhone, for instance: Apple execs outlined the ability to weed out spam texts or other unknown senders and an option to hold your spot on a phone call when you've been waiting for a representative to pick up. Plus, a treasured feature that we took for granted is coming back (hint: it's in the Photos app).\nSiri, meanwhile, is in a holding pattern. Apple has previously specified that its smarter voice assistant — first promised at WWDC 2024 — is delayed until some point \"in the coming year,\" so you shouldn't expect any major changes in the current betas. But there are reports that Apple is aiming to give Siri a bigger brain transplant by basing it on third-party artificial intelligence models like OpenAI's ChatGPT or Anthropic's Claude, which could make 2026 a pivotal year. The company is also reportedly working on a 'stripped-down' AI chatbot to rival ChatGPT.\nWith each beta, it seems like additional new improvements are popping up, like this new AirPods gesture we're all curious about, and this FaceTime feature that'll freeze your video if it detects nudity. With the release of the iOS 26 developer beta 5, we saw more added features, like a new bouncy animation on the passcode screen and in the Control Center, MacRumors reports. Some or all of those changes will likely soon migrate into the separate public beta (see below). Most newer iPhone models are eligible to download iOS 26 (both the betas and final version). Want to see the full list of new features coming this fall? Read on. \nWhat is iOS 26?\nThe current iPhone operating system is iOS 18, and Apple is still actively updating it — version 18.6.1 was released to restore Apple Watch blood oxygen monitoring functionality for certain users in the US. More recently, Apple released 18.6.2 to address a vulnerability related to image processing. Apple has officially stopped signing iOS 18.6, MacRumors reports, which means it can no longer be installed on your iPhone due to a \"server-side software verification check.\" That's pretty normal when newer versions are available to download.\nBut don't expect to see iOS 19 soon — or ever. Instead, Apple is skipping the numbering ahead to iOS 26 next month. The company has decided to line up its iOS version numbers with a year-based system, similar to car model years. So while iOS and its sibling operating systems will be released in late 2025, they're all designated \"26\" to reflect the year ahead. \nIt's official, we're moving to iOS 26. (Apple)\nWhat is Liquid Glass design?\nLet's be honest. Out of everything announced at WWDC this year, the new Liquid Glass design was the star of the show. The iPhone's home and lock screens have looked pretty much the same year after year — the last exciting thing (in my opinion) was the option to add your own aesthetic to your home screen by customizing your apps and widgets. So seeing the home and lock screens' new facelift is refreshing.\nSo what exactly is Liquid Glass? Apple calls it a \"new translucent material\" since, well, the apps and widgets are clear. However, the screen can still adapt to dark and light modes, depending on surroundings. You'll also notice buttons with a new floating design in several apps, like Phone and Maps. They're designed to be less distracting than the current buttons, but are still easy to see. While the design overhaul has proven to be controversial since its announcement, some — including Engadget's own Devindra Hardawar — like the new direction, even if it's somewhat reminiscent of Microsoft's translucent Windows Vista Aero designs from nearly twenty years ago.\nThat said, as of the release of the iOS 26 beta 2, Apple has already incorporated some user feedback into the design, dialing back the transparency in at least some places. And while it will continue to evolve, Apple users won't be able to escape it: Liquid Glass was designed to make all of Apple's OSes more cohesive. Here's a look at how the translucent aesthetic will look with the new macOS Tahoe 26 on your desktop.\nWhat are the new and notable features of iOS 26?\niOS 26 has a laundry list of new features. Among the most worthwhile:\nPhone app redesign: You'll finally be able to scroll through contacts, recent calls and voicemail messages all on one screen. It also comes with a new feature called Hold Assist that'll notify you when an agent comes to the phone so you can avoid the elevator music and continue on with other tasks.\nLive Translation in Phone, FaceTime and Messages: iOS 26 is bringing the ability to have a conversation via phone call or text message with someone who speaks another language. Live Translation will translate your conversation in real time, which results in some stop-and-go interactions in the examples Apple shared during its presentation.\nPolls in group chats: Tired of sorting through what seems like hundreds of messages in your group chat? You and your friends will soon be able to create polls in group messages for deciding things like which brunch spot you're eating at or whose car you're taking on a road trip.\nFiltering unknown senders in Messages: If you haven't received spam texts about unpaid tolls or other citations, you're lucky. For those of us who have, those annoying messages will soon be filtered away in a separate folder.\nVisual Intelligence: Similar to a reverse Google image search, this new feature will allow you to search for anything that's on your iPhone screen. For instance, if you spot a pair of shoes someone is wearing in an Instagram photo, you can screenshot it and use Visual Intelligence to find those shoes (or similar ones) online.\nPhotos tabs are back: For anyone who's still frustrated with the Photos changes made last year, you'll be happy to know that your tabs are coming back. Library and Collections will have their own separate spaces so you don't have to scroll to infinity to find what you're looking for.\nFaceTime \"Communication Safety\" feature: A newer addition to iOS 26 appears to be the FaceTime \"Communication Safety\" feature that pauses communications if and when nudity is detected. The feature appears to be a child safety feature that uses on-device detection, thus obviating any cloud-based privacy issues. \nNew lock screen options: The iPhone lock screen gets more customizable in iOS 26, with a cooler clock, 3D wallpaper effects, more widgets and better focus mode options. \nApple's Hold Assist will be nifty for those pesky services that put you on hold for 10 or more minutes. (Apple)\nNew changes coming to iPadOS 26\nYour iPad isn't getting left behind when it comes to big updates. Here's what's coming this fall.\nMultitasking and real windowing: When you download the newest update, you'll be able to have multiple apps running on your screen at the same time. Once you open an app, it'll appear on your screen as normal but you'll be able to resize and move it across your screen to make room for other apps. This feature is optional so you can turn it off if you don't like it.\nVisual update: Along with the other new OSes, iPadOS 26 is coming with the Liquid Glass aesthetic. This new look will appear on the lock and home screens, as well as the drop-down menus.\nNew menu bar: When you swipe down on your screen, the new menu bar will appear with options like File, Edit, Windows and more. There's also a search option if you're looking for something specific.\nCheck out our first impressions of iPadOS 26. \nWhat about AirPods?\nAirPods are also getting updated with iOS 26. Here are some of the more notable functions.\nEnhanced audio recording: Apple calls this \"studio-quality\" audio recording, and with it, you'll notice more clarity while in noisy environments.\nCamera remote control: Using this, you can take a photo or start and stop video recording with just one press on your AirPods. When taking photos, you'll get a three-second countdown before your iPhone or iPad snaps the picture.\nLive translation feature: While not officially announced or confirmed, it appears that the long-rumored live translation for AirPods could be coming with iOS 26. The evidence comes from a system asset spotted in the in iOS 26 beta showing a gesture that's triggered by pressing both earbud stems at the same time. The photo also shows words in several different languages. \nHeart rate monitoring (rumored for now): Bloomberg's Mark Gurman believes Apple will introduce new AirPods Pro earbuds this year, which could have heart rate monitoring. It would work with Apple's Health app and other fitness apps that track heart rates.\nWhich iPhones will be able to upgrade to iOS 26?\nA few iPhone models that run the current version of iOS — iPhone XR, XS and XS Max — won't be compatible with the latest upgrade. But any iPhones released in 2019 or later will be eligible for the iOS 26 update.\n\niPhone SE (second generation or later)\niPhone 11\niPhone 11 Pro\niPhone 11 Pro Max\niPhone 12\niPhone 12 mini\niPhone 12 Pro\niPhone 12 Pro Max\niPhone 13\niPhone 13 mini\niPhone 13 Pro\niPhone 13 Pro Max\niPhone 14\niPhone 14 Plus\niPhone 14 Pro\niPhone 14 Pro Max\niPhone 15\niPhone 15 Plus\niPhone 15 Pro\niPhone 15 Pro Max\niPhone 16\niPhone 16 Plus\niPhone 16 Pro\niPhone 16 Pro Max\niPhone 16e\n\nNot listed here are the presumed new iPhone 17 models (or maybe iPhone 26?) that are all but certain to be announced and released in September. \nHow to install iOS 26 beta\nThe iOS 26 public beta is now available to download via the Apple Beta Software Program. If you're not already a member, you'll need to sign up to try out all the latest features. Just visit beta.apple.com and sign up with your phone number or email address. It's free.\nOnce you're in, you can install it by going to Settings > General > Software Update and selecting iOS 26 public beta. \nA word of caution: Don't sign up with your main iPhone unless you're OK with any risks that occur with using an OS that isn't finalized.\nWhen will the final version of iOS 26 be released?\niOS 26 will be released to the public this fall. It usually comes in September, within a week of the Apple iPhone event. Last year, it rolled out to iPhone users on September 16 — exactly one week after the iPhone 16 lineup was announced. Since the iPhone 17 event falls on September 9 this year, it's possible the downloads will hit our phones on September 16.\nIf you're more interested in the Apple Intelligence features coming, here's everything Apple revealed for iOS, macOS and more during WWDC. Also, check out how iOS 26 screenshots could be an intriguing preview of Apple's delayed Siri rework.\nUpdate, August 27: Added the official iPhone 17 event date, as well as the potential iOS 26 release.\nUpdate, August 25: Added a rumor about new AirPods Pro having heart rate monitoring.\nUpdate, August 22: Noted that Apple has officially stopped signing iOS 18.6.\nUpdate, August 20: Noted that iOS 26 public beta 4 and iOS 18.6.2 are now available to download.\nUpdate, August 18: Added details about a potential iOS 18.6 update.\nUpdate, August 15: Added to link to what to expect at the Apple iPhone event and details about what's available in the iOS 26 screenshots editor.\nUpdate, August 13: Added new AirPods detail spotted in the iOS 26 beta.\nUpdate, August 11: Noted that iOS 26 developer beta has hit beta 6. \nUpdate, August 8: Added new features coming with iPadOS 26 and AirPods.\nUpdate, August 6: Noted the release of iOS 26 beta 5 and the new bouncy feature on passcode screen and Control Center.\nUpdate, August 4: Noted that Apple is reportedly working on a ChatGPT rival.\nUpdate, August 1: Added quote from Tim Cook about iOS 26.\nUpdate, July 31: Noted that iOS 18.6 is now available. \nUpdate, July 24: Noted the iOS 26 public beta is now available.\nUpdate, July 3: Noted new FaceTime feature found in the developer beta.\nUpdate, June 30: Noted ongoing iOS 18 releases, and reports that Apple is considering additional external LLMs for Siri. \nUpdate, June 25: Noted changes added in iOS 26 beta 2. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/apple-ios-26-public-beta-5-is-live-here-are-all-the-new-iphone-features-coming-in-september-135749996.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "It's official: The Apple iPhone 17 event will take place on Tuesday, September 9 at 1PM ET. That means we'll finally get to take a look at the much-anticipated iPhone 17 lineup — which will come equipped with the latest iOS 26 features preinstalled — and any new features Apple reveals that day. But since we still have to wait a couple of weeks until the iPhone event, we can only speculate what the new devices will look like. As with most unreleased iPhones, rumors and leaks have trickled in about the hardware side ahead of the official introduction. Here's what we're expecting and what we can reasonably assume we'll get from Apple in September.\nWhat are the latest iPhone 17 rumors?\nAfter the announcement dropped yesterday for the official iPhone 17 event, MacRumors speculates the Apple logo says a lot about the new iPhones. Apple's logo \"hints at two rumored iPhone 17 Pro features.\" \nThe logo shows bright orange and dark blue colors, rumored to be two of the iPhone 17 Pro colors, so they could be onto something. They also noticed it looks like an infrared heat map, hinting at the vapor chamber cooling system.\nGet ready for an awe dropping #AppleEvent on Tuesday, September 9! pic.twitter.com/uAcYp2RLMM— Tim Cook (@tim_cook) August 26, 2025\n\nThese rumors haven't been confirmed by Apple and we won't know what the actual iPhone 17 models will look like until the iPhone event next month. \nHow much will the iPhone 17 cost?\nApple's announced plan to expand US-based manufacturing partners seems to give it at least some shielding from the steepest Trump administration tariffs that have already triggered price increases on everything from PlayStations to Switch consoles to high-end cameras to Sonos speakers. But given that President Trump's trade policies can change from week to week, and Apple's continuing reliance on Asia-based supply chains, price shocks remain an ongoing possibility. The bigger question is: Will Apple absorb any higher costs, or pass them on to consumers? \nIf prices do creep up, Apple may choose to pair it with an \"upgrade.\" Consider this recent rumor posted by MacRumors from a leaker known as \"Instant Digital,\" suggesting that the default storage of the iPhone 17 line may start at 256GB, doubling the current 128GB baseline. While that could be accompanied by a price increase of $50, Apple could at least pitch it as a \"better value.\" That said, the company doubled the default RAM of its Mac computers from 8GB to 16GB at no extra cost in 2024 — but that was before the current Trump tariff cycle started.\nWhen will the iPhone 17 series be announced?\nMost years, the flagship smartphones are introduced in September. MacRumors highlighted a story originally reported by iphone-ticker.de that the Apple iPhone 17 event could be Tuesday, September 9, according to information gleaned from German mobile phone providers.\nIt's still too early to have the specific dates; some years, Apple only gives a week or two of lead time between sending invites and hosting the event. But years of past precedent show that sometime in September should be when the 17 models make their debut. This family of smartphones may be the last to follow that trend, however. There have been hints that the introduction of the iPhone 18 collection in 2026 will be split into a pro-tier announcement in the fall and a standard model announcement the following spring.\nWhat will the new iPhone 17 lineup include?\nDesign leaks suggest that Apple is building an ultra-thin smartphone, likely to be named the iPhone 17 Air to match Apple's ultralight laptop designation. Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, often a solid source of advanced intel about Apple, reported in January that the iPhone 17 Air will be equipped with a basic A19 chip and will only have a single camera lens. It may also use Apple's new in-house modem, which was introduced in February on the iPhone 16e. More details about this development may leak ahead of September, but that's what we know for now.\nAn investor note from Apple analyst Jeff Pu indicated that the Air will have a titanium frame. If his reports are accurate, the lightweight smartphone will be the only entry in the iPhone 17 lineup to use that metal; the iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone 17 Pro Max are expected to be made of aluminum, which is oddly a lighter material than titanium. Other speculation had suggested that the Air would use a blend of aluminum and titanium, so the exact materials may not be known until the official announcement.\nAdditionally, an August 4 MacRumors report says the internal battery pack of the iPhone Air is just 2.49mm thick — half the thickness of the iPhone 17 Pro battery. The leak was posted on the Korean-language Naver blog, where they show the alleged batteries of the iPhone 17 Air and 17 Pro side by side. The same account claimed the 17 Air's battery capacity was a mere 2,800 mAh, MacRumors notes. (That's below the battery capacity of current iPhone 16 models.)\nOn a similar topic, an iPhone 17 Pro production leak appears to have revealed an all-aluminum chassis, according to MacRumors. Originally posted by leaker Majin Bu, the image shows a shell that has a large round hole on the back (where the Apple logo typically is) to allow for MagSafe charging. MacRumors says this could just be a molding but notes that the aluminum frame (versus the current titanium in Pro iPhone models) would yield a significantly lower weight.\nThat same leaker (Majin Bu), whom MacRumors classifies as a \"hit-or-miss leaker,\" suggests the iPhone 17 Pro will have better wireless signal strength thanks to an updated antenna design. The individual posted a render on X that shows a new antenna system that wraps around the iPhone 17 Pro's supposedly wider rear camera bump. Again, this is a render, not a real-world photo. That said, we can't knock the goal of better wireless reception, so we're hoping this one has a degree of truth to it.\nLeaker Majin Bu also claims \"TechWoven\" cases could be introduced, per a MacRumors report. The cases match the rumored design on the iPhone 17 models, with the wide camera bump. The leaker noted there are two lanyard holes for \"convenient and secure carrying,\" so it could be worn around your neck. The colors would come in grey/black, blue, green, purple and orange. Additionally, he says there will be new Liquid Silicone cases in eight colors, including Deep Orange, Pale Orange, Grass Green, Celadon, Fog Purple, Grey Blue, Dark Blue and Midnight Black. \nEach new roster includes a base model, but over the years, Apple has shaken up the variety of phones it offers. Most likely there will be an iPhone 17 and an iPhone 17 Pro. Apple has also committed to the size matters philosophy, and has been building an iPhone Pro Max option with an even bigger screen and better battery life; the 17 roster will almost certainly have one as well. \nThe new Pro iPhones are said to have a full-width \"camera island\" on the rear, which would mark the first time an Apple model opted for that design. This feature can be seen in the purported iPhone 17 \"spotted in the wild.\" The pics, highlighted on MacRumors, show a black cased iPhone (17 Pro?) with the distinct back panel. Is it the real deal? The dual angles lend a degree of credibility in a social media landscape increasingly polluted with AI-enhanced fakes, but your guess is as good as ours.\nI just spotted a test development iPhone in the wild 🤩🤩🤩 pic.twitter.com/iS3PtKWqxJ— Fox Pupy 🦊🧡 (@Skyfops) July 28, 2025\n\nThe iPhone 17 Air seems primed to take the place of a potential iPhone 17 Plus. Since the iPhone 16e was only just introduced in February at a surprisingly high price point, it seems unlikely that there will be a new addition to that lower end of the spectrum, the models that were previously called SE. \nAt the very least, it sounds like the iPhone 17 Air won't take away the charging port and rely only on wireless connectivity. Bloomberg said that while Apple had investigated making the iPhone 17 Air without a single port, the company (fortunately) changed plans. He also says that the rumored phone will have a 6.6-inch screen and include the Dynamic Island and Camera Control button. Finally, the price is rumored at $900 — likely more than the standard iPhone 17 but less than the Pro.\nWe've also gotten what seems to be a reliable look at what the color lineup will be for the new smartphones. Macworld reported that the iPhone 17 will be available in black, white, steel gray, green, purple and light blue. The iPhone 17 Air will reportedly have four color options: black, white, light blue and light gold. While the Air colors will be less saturated, the visuals for the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max will go bold. The options for the Pro models are expected to be black, white, gray, dark blue and orange.\nBloomberg's Mark Gurman believes there actually will be a new orange color offered for the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max, as well as a light blue color for the iPhone 17 Air, he confirmed in his weekly Power On newsletter.\nOn July 30, Tom's Guide highlighted an X post from Sonny Dickson — a longtime and generally reliable leaker of unreleased iPhone information — showing \"dummy\" iPhone 17 models in the new colors that were the source of the aforementioned Macworld story. While these are literally just mock-ups — not real, leaked iPhones — it's interesting to see how the design and color rumors translate into a real-world look and feel.\nTo add the the rumors, a Weibo leaker known as Digital Chat Station suggests the iPhone 17e will come equipped with a new design that includes the Dynamic Island, MacRumors reports. According to the post, the new phone will have the A19 chip and could have a 6.1-inch OLED display with a front-facing 12-megapixel camera and a rear-facing 48-megapixel camera. However, it's important to note this report refers to the 17e model that would be expected to launch no earlier than February 2026, if it followed the same release pattern as the iPhone 16e.\nWhat will iOS 26 be like?\nApple upended its numbering conventions with WWDC 2025, and will match the name of each new operating system to the year it's released. So when the next wave of iPhones hits, they'll be running on iOS 26.\nOn the design side, the smartphone OS introduced during the big developer showcase took a contentious approach dubbed Liquid Glass. Apple has been scaling down the amount of transparency effects in the subsequent beta tests of iOS 26, but it will still have a glass-like visual.\nThe feature list includes big and small updates. On the more impactful side, the Phone and Photos apps have been redesigned. There will be several features leveraging artificial intelligence, such as live translation capabilities coming to Phone, FaceTime and Messages. Apple is also currently testing a sensitive content warning for child accounts that will freeze FaceTime video if nudity is detected by on-device machine learning tools. And the company is also launching Visual Intelligence, which will use AI to search for elements in an image.\niOS 26 also has a litany of minor, quality of life improvements. Group texts are getting support for polls. And for the slow risers out there, iOS 26 will finally let you escape the tyranny of the nine minute snooze alarm. \nThe next iOS is now available as a public beta. Here are our initial impressions of the Liquid Glass design and other new features. iOS 26 is compatible with all models back through iPhone 11.\nWhat other products are expected to be released alongside the iPhone 17?\nIf Apple follows its usual pattern, the iPhone 17 will be announced alongside new Apple Watch products. That would be the Apple Watch Series 11 (if Apple sticks to the same naming scheme), and maybe an Apple Watch Ultra 3 and/or an updated Apple Watch SE. (They'll all run watchOS 26, of course.) Other possibilities — and this is, again, speculation — could include refreshed Apple AirPods Pro (which received its last big update in 2022) and maybe new AirTags trackers (first released in 2021).\nThe Apple rumor mill got a big shot in the arm this week thanks to the reported inclusion of product ID numbers in recent beta software builds. Per MacRumors, it's a laundry list of new hardware, including long-rumored product updates like the Apple TV, HomePod mini, new Apple Studio Display monitor and two fresh iPads. \nOf course, even if that list is totally accurate, we may not see those products until 2026 — if ever. So don't expect all of products to share the stage with the iPhone 17, especially since Apple likes to keep its star performer at the center of attention. \nThat said, keep in mind that Apple has recently been having Mac-centric announcements in late October (as it did last year to debut new M4 Macs), so there's always the chance of another shoe dropping a few weeks down the road.  \nUpdate, August 27, 2025, 5:44PM ET: Added official Apple iPhone 17 event date, and a rumor about its event logo.\nUpdate, August 25, 2025, 5:15PM ET: Added new reports about the iPhone 17 Pro's orange color as well as new rumored Liquid Silicone cases.\nUpdate, August 22, 2025, 11:52AM ET: Added new details about the colors of the rumored TechWoven case.\nUpdate, August 20, 2025, 7:12PM ET: Added new rumor about potential TechWoven case for iPhone 17 series.\nUpdate, August 18, 2025, 6:23PM ET: Added new rumor about the iPhone 17e potentially having the Dynamic Island.\nUpdate, August 15, 2025, 2:05PM ET: Added new rumor about the all-aluminum chassis on the iPhone 17.\nUpdate, August 13, 2025, 10:02PM ET: Added a list of the products that are expected to be released alongside the iPhone 17s. \nUpdate, August 11, 2025, 7:27PM ET: Added a render of a rumored new antenna design for the iPhone 17 Pro.\nUpdate, August 8, 2025, 4:43PM ET: Added new speculation and reports about iPhone 17 pricing.\nUpdate, August 6, 2025, 4:05PM ET: Added latest details about the potential iPhone 17 event date.\nUpdate, August 4, 2025, 5:23PM ET: Added latest battery leaks about the iPhone 17 models.\nUpdate, August 1, 2025, 8:15AM ET: Added new photos showing potential iPhone 17 colors.\nUpdate, July 30, 2025, 11:08AM ET: Added latest leaks and rumors about the iPhone 17, and updated information on the iOS 26 public beta.\nUpdate, July 17, 2025, 4:40PM ET: Added latest information about iOS 26, possible materials for the Air, and the color options for the different models.\nUpdate, March 17, 2025, 2PM ET: Added details about the rumored price and features of the iPhone 17 Air.\nUpdate, April 11, 2025, 3:45PM ET: Added details from Front Page Tech's new video that claims to reveal details from a leaked iOS 19 build.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/the-iphone-17-event-is-september-9-heres-everything-to-know-about-the-upcoming-apple-lineup-153024127.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Choosing the best Android phone can feel overwhelming as there are so many options from so many brands, it’s hard to know where to start. Unlike Apple, which sticks to its sleek lineup of iPhones, Android offers a world of variety. Whether you're eyeing the latest flagship from Samsung, a budget-friendly smartphone from Motorola or something unique with a foldable design, there’s an Android device out there to suit your needs.The beauty of Android is its flexibility. You’ll find phones with different screen sizes, camera setups, battery life and even quirky extras like stylus support or rugged builds. Plus, Android lets you customize your device to your heart's content – something Apple fans might envy. We’ve tested and researched the top Android phones to help you find the right one for your budget, lifestyle, and tech preferences.\nBest Android phones for 2025\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhat to look for in a new Android phone\nPerformance\nWhen it comes to picking our favorite Android phones, the main things we look for are pretty straightforward: good performance (both compute and AI), a nice display, solid design, sharp cameras, long battery life and a significant commitment to ongoing software support. For performance, not only do we look at benchmarks and other metrics, but we also evaluate phones based on responsiveness. Regardless of whether you’re reading, text messaging, scrolling through social media or playing a game, no one wants a gadget that feels sluggish. \nDisplay\n\n\n\n\nWhen it comes to displays, we generally prefer OLED panels that can produce rich, saturated colors with at least 600 nits of brightness, though many of our top mid-range and high-end phones can hit 1,000 nits or more. And more recently, most of our favorite devices also support screens with fast refresh rates of 90Hz or 120Hz, which adds an extra level of smoothness and fluidity.\nDesign\nNow we will admit there is a bit of subjectivity when deciding which phones look the best, but there are other design aspects like dust and water resistance or screen durability that can make a big difference to long-term survival. It’s also important to consider things like support for wireless charging, power sharing (aka reverse wireless charging) and UWB connectivity, which can have an impact on how your phone interacts with your other devices.\nCameras\nObviously, for photos we’re looking for sharp, colorful shots in both bright and low-light conditions. And we want video clips with high dynamic range, rich audio and smooth image stabilization. Extra cameras for ultra-wide and telephoto lenses are a plus. The best cameras should also include features like dedicated night modes, support for various video recording resolutions, and additional photo modes like timelapse, slow motion and more.\nBattery and software\nFinally, in terms of longevity, we’re looking for all-day battery life on devices that also delivered great results on our local video rundown test (at least 16 hours on a charge, but more is obviously better). Wireless charging capabilities have become almost ubiquitous over the past few years, and most of our top picks have this extra perk. Fast-charging is available on some Android phones, too. Finally, with people holding onto their phones longer than ever, we like to see companies commit to at least three years of software support, upgrades and regular security updates.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/best-android-phone-130030805.html?src=rss",

Not only do both devices now support full high-res portrait shots, its 100x Pro Res Zoom captures long-range photos in ways that lenses and megapixels alone simply can’t. Then you add in noticeably better performance, bigger batteries, brighter displays and proper Qi2 magnetic charging (the first from a major Android phone maker) via Pixelsnap and you have truly smart devices that makes picking anything else seem kind of dumb.

    "summary": "Google marked the tenth generation of Pixels with four new smartphones. While the ‘pro’ and foldable Pixel 10 models might have no-compromise specs (and prices to match), Google has blurred the lines between its entry-level Pixel 10 and those premium devices. This year, the base Pixel 10 has a bigger battery, a new 5x zoom telephoto camera and almost as many AI features as the flagship Pixel 10 Pro and Pixel 10 Pro Fold.\nIf the celebrity-loaded Made By Google event was anything to go by, the company is putting a lot more effort (and money) into making the Pixel a genuine threat to the Galaxy S series and iPhones, and conveying that message to everyone. The Pixel 10 deserves those comparisons, and in a lot of ways, it’s the better smartphone. \n \nHardware and display\nGoogle’s 10th-generation of Pixels look a lot like their predecessors. There’s a protruding pill-shaped camera unit, which is the central design flourish. It’s substantial, which still looks a little jarring, but it also doubles as a sort of grip for my index finger while holding the phone, something I noticed after a year of using the Pixel 9 Pro. Google has also refreshed the color range of its Pixel family. Both a vivid blue (Indigo) and mild yellow (Lemongrass) shades are welcome additions to the typical black and white hues.\nThe 6.3-inch screen’s refresh rate still tops out at 120Hz, but that’s now pretty much standard across midrange devices and up. Even the entry-level Pixel 9a has the same smooth scrolling experience. However, Google has boosted the Pixel 10’s brightness, now peaking at 3,000 nits, which is a slight increase from 2,700 nits on the Pixel 9. The screen maxes out at 2,000 nits at its brightest setting for HDR, which is also a bump up from the Pixel 9. Google has also boosted the sound quality on the Pixel 10 to be noticeably less tinny and a little bassier than previous Pixels.\nAnother addition is Pixelsnap, which is essentially MagSafe for Pixels. The wireless charging integration is largely the same, with magnets that firmly attach the device to charging pucks, accessories and docks. It easily worked with a range of wireless chargers, although Qi2-supported options are still rarer than they should be. You’re more likely to find a MagSafe-branded wireless charger from third-party companies like Belkin, but those don’t achieve the faster charge speeds of Qi2.\nIf you’re feeling spendy, Google’s official Pixelsnap charger is $40 (or $70 with a stand) and reaches speeds up to 25W, while there’s a PopSocket-like Pixel ring stand that can snap to the back of the phone. Note that the Pixel 10 can only wirelessly charge up to 15W, though. Additionally, the Pixel 10 series supports most of the MagSafe peripherals that iPhone users have been enjoying since 2020.\nCamera\n\n\n\n\nThe big hardware upgrade this year is the cameras. The photo unit includes a 48-megapixel wide-angle setup, a 13MP sensor with an ultra-wide lens and a 10.8MP 5x telephoto camera. For a base phone, it’s an impressive combo, even though it doesn’t quite match the higher-res sensors found in the Pixel 10 Pro — or last year’s Pixel 9 Pro.\n\n\n\n\nThat new telephoto lens isn’t some middling 2x or 3x zoom, but a 5x zoom which puts it beyond rivals at a similar price point, like the Galaxy S25 (3x zoom). The iPhone 16 doesn't even have a telephoto lens and makes do with an \"optical-quality\" digital zoom. It’s like using a Pixel Pro, with an additional cropped zoom up to 10x and a (less consistent) Super Res Zoom up to 20x. This is a significant step up for the base model and something I’m sure we’ll see the aforementioned rivals likely try to match. Simply put, the Pixel 10 is just a better, more versatile camera phone than, say, the Galaxy S25.\n\n\n\n\nI tested the Pixel 10’s telephoto against the 9 Pro’s, and there were noticeable differences in detail and crispness, which is understandable as the latter has a much higher-res 48MP sensor. However, that doesn’t detract from the leap in both detail and shooting range compared to the base Pixel 9 from last year.\nThe Pixel 10 can also capture 10-bit HDR video now, although it doesn’t offer the Pixel 10 Pro’s 8K video, Night Sight Video and Super Res Zoom Video options. There’s no Video Boost, either, which uploads footage to Google’s cloud to enhance online.\n\n\n\n\nThere are plenty of other notable camera features onboard, including Night Sight low-light shooting, or Add Me, which is still the standout Pixel camera feature from last year and hasn’t been replicated by rivals yet. For those who missed my praise last year, Add Me stitches together two group photos, taken by two different people. The mode guides users to line up the shots, meaning your group photos can finally include the person who takes all of them (me).\nCamera Coach is an intriguing addition to the Pixel camera experience. Above the viewfinder, there’s a new camera icon with a plus sign in the top right corner. Tapping it makes the screen flash, and the coach will offer multiple framing and photo-taking suggestions. It’ll also add a Get Inspired option that goes a bit more avant-garde, generating thumbnails of possible results based off of the sample it took, filling the gaps with generative AI.\nI witheringly launched the Coach, ready to criticize its basic suggestions or common-sense ideas. But, you know what, it’s not bad. With hooks in Gemini AI, the mode will offer angle, lighting and composition suggestions. You can also choose whether to emphasize, say, the pattern of some leaves, or the background behind it or the group of people to the side. While the feature utilizes Google’s Tensor G5 chip to analyze shots, it does require an internet connection.\nSoftware\n\n\n\n\nThanks to the Tensor G5 chip, the Pixel 10 can run Google’s newest Gemini Nano model on-device. This means generative AI experiences can now be used without the need for connectivity. However, as I mentioned with Camera Coach, that isn’t always the case.\nHowever, Magic Cue does work without having to summon its answers from the cloud. And when it works, it’s what I’ve wanted from AI assistants for years. After gaining your permission, Gemini gets into your screenshots, calendar, Gmail accounts and more. Magic Cue will pull in the information you need, hopefully, where you need it. For example, it displays the email address for that comedy show venue your friend wants tickets for, or nudges your calendar to show availability when a friend asks what your weekend plans are. These cues are highlighted with a rainbow “aura” that has become the de facto visual shorthand for artificial intelligence. This is just the start: Google will eventually add the ability for Magic Cue to tap into your photos, suggesting images when someone’s mentioned in text messages, emails and more.\nMagic Cue has some blind spots, though. As my colleague Sam Rutherford noted in his Pixel 10 Pro review, I found it particularly fussy with calendar cues, often failing to identify dates or times in screenshots or emails. It’s also missing a major area of where I want all of this info: third-party messaging apps. But hey, if you’re using Google Messages, you’re good to go.\nGoogle’s almost-instantaneous voice translation during calls is impressive too. Managing Editor Cherlynn Low laid out how that works, and while it’s a technical marvel, I’m not sure how much I’d use the feature for high-stakes conversations like booking accommodations or sorting out travel issues.\nI also liked Take a Message, which transcribes calls when you’re unable to answer. However, just like I did while I was testing Apple’s similar feature during my iOS 26 preview, I either answered calls instinctively [Ed. note: Mat is clearly a different specimen from the rest of us humans] or people didn’t leave voicemails.\nThere are plenty of minor upgrades to existing tools and features on the Pixel 10. Gemini Live, which can “see” through your camera or read what’s on screen, can also now offer visual guidance, highlighting objects onscreen after hearing your request or question. NotebookLM now integrates with Pixel Screenshots and Recorder. If the former detects something that could be useful to an existing NotebookLM project, it’ll suggest adding it for easier access.\nThere are also Writing Tools (sound familiar?) within Gboard, which can retool your existing prose into specified writing styles. It’ll even suggest which emojis to add into the mix. For now, this is only compatible with US English, so it’s not my favourite favorite. There’s also a new Pixel Journal app, which sounds pretty familiar too. I briefly tested it out during the days I’ve had the phone, but if you haven’t found the app/notebook/diary to journal in yet, it’s a perfectly fine option, with AI-powered suggestions on what to write about and the ability to attach photos and other details that your smartphone can log. Something that wasn’t apparent during my review was that the Journal app will learn about your writing patterns and offer up insights on how often you write, when you typically write and more.\nPerformance and battery life\n\n\n\n\nGoogle says its new Tensor G5 chip is 34 percent faster than last year’s G4, while the TPU (Tensor Processing Unit, ugh) is 60 percent faster at AI tasks. Performance testing apps like Geekbench 6 can’t be installed on Pixel devices before the phones go on sale, so I wasn’t able to quantify the upgrade. I can feel those improvements with heavier processing tasks though, like transcription, translation and image generation, in apps like Pixel Studio. The Pixel 10 also had no issues running graphically intensive games like Infinity Nikki and Zenless Zone Zero, and seemed quicker to load most apps compared to Pixel phones of the past. Google’s Tensor chips are definitely catching up.\nAnecdotally, I find myself using Google’s Pixel AI features (and Gemini) significantly more often than on other Android devices I’ve used and tested. With comparable AI tasks, such as transcribing an interview, the Tensor G5 appears to handle them more efficiently, delivering results in less time.\nThe Pixel 10 has a 4,970mAh battery, which is not only bigger than the Pixel 9 (4,700mAh) but also the Pixel 10 Pro (4,870mAh). However, the Pixel 10 doesn’t quite match the 27 hours-plus rundown time of the Pixel 9. Running a looping video, this year’s phone lasted around 22 hours, which is a bit disappointing given the specs. I’ll retest and update this review if the results differ.\nThe Pixel 10 supports wired charging up to 30W, returning to over 50 percent in under 30 minutes. It can also be wirelessly charged at up to 15W, thanks to Qi2 support. That’s an improvement, but it’s not Qi2.2 like the Pixel 10 Pro XL, which can reach 25W charging wirelessly.\nWrap-up\n\n\n\n\nThe Pixel 10 redefines what we should expect from base flagship smartphones. With Apple’s next iPhone just around the corner, Google has added a 5x telephoto camera, rounding out the Pixel’s photography chops offering while augmenting it with more features powered by Gemini. Camera Coach might not be for everyone, but Magic Cue — like Pixel Screenshots last year — is a glimpse into the future of how we’ll use AI on smartphones.\nThe Pixel 10 is a substantial upgrade from the Pixel 9, although given it has the Tensor G5 chip, it’s a shame that software features like Zoom Enhance from last year’s Pixels didn’t make the cut. Unless you’re a die-hard smartphone gamer, there isn’t a more capable smartphone at this price.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/google-pixel-10-review-170041718.html?src=rss",
    "full_text": "While it doesn’t have cameras quite as powerful as the Pixel 10 Pro, it combines the utility of a long-range telephoto camera with an array of camera software tools that benefit both professional and novice smartphone photographers alike. Under the hood there’s a tangibly more powerful processor and a bigger battery, while Qi2 support with Pixelsnap means the Pixel 10 works with tripods, wireless charging docks and other accessories made for iPhones. It easily worked with a range of wireless chargers, although Qi2-supported options are still rarer than they should be. The iPhone 16 doesn't even have a telephoto lens and makes do with an \"optical-quality\" digital zoom. While the feature utilizes Google’s Tensor G5 chip to analyze shots, it does require an internet connection. However, Magic Cue does work without having to summon its answers from the cloud. These cues are highlighted with a rainbow “aura” that has become the de facto visual shorthand for artificial intelligence. I also liked Take a Message, which transcribes calls when you’re unable to answer. note: Mat is clearly a different specimen from the rest of us humans] or people didn’t leave voicemails. There are plenty of minor upgrades to existing tools and features on the Pixel 10."

    "summary": "In the ‘90s, the term “smartphone” emerged to denote devices with “advanced computing” features that allowed you to do more than just make calls. But if we’re being honest, applying that label to pocket-sized gadgets that ran cut-down versions of desktop PC apps with half-baked UIs was kind of overselling it. More recently though, we’ve seen handsets like those from Google come with sophisticated features that simply aren’t available anywhere else, due in no small part to the rise of AI. And now with the arrival of the Pixel 10 Pro and Pixel 10 Pro XL, these devices feel like they are redefining the “smart” in smartphone as we know it.\n \nDesign and display: Bringing the polish\nThe overall look and feel of the Pixel 10 Pro and Pro XL haven’t changed much since last year. You still get polished aluminum sides sandwiched by slabs of Gorilla Glass Victus 2 and an IP68 rating for dust and water resistance. The main differences are a slightly updated lineup of colors (moonstone, jade, porcelain and obsidian) and a switch from a matte to shiny finish on the back. This is a small bummer for me as I prefer the soft-touch feel of its predecessors. The pale gold frame on the jade model is a nice touch, even if I would have preferred a richer shade of green. \nThe Pixel 10 Pro and Pro XL’s 120Hz OLED screens have gotten a touch brighter, now topping out at 3,300 nits (up from 3,000). This makes them a bit easier to see outside in direct sunlight while retaining the gorgeous vivid colors we’ve enjoyed on Google’s phones since switching to its Super Actua-branded displays. And with the screens themselves coming in at 6.3- and 6.8-inches, there’s no deviation in sizing either.\n\n\n\n\n   Sam Rutherford for Engadget \n \n\nMy one small gripe is that at least in the US, the Pixel 10 family is now eSIM-only. As someone who prefers the convenience of being able to swap mobile networks at a moment’s notice, I really wish Google hadn’t. But ever since Apple made a similar switch back on the iPhone 14, this was bound to happen at some point. Like microSD card expandability and 3.5mm audio, physical sims have become another endangered feature on the brink of extinction.\nPerformance: The Tensor G5 is faster but not quite peak\nWith Google’s focus on AI performance, the everyday speed of its phones has always lagged a touch behind other Android flagships. However, thanks to the Tensor G5, the Pixel 10 line has closed that gap considerably due to CPUs that are more than 30 percent faster than before. Even without the ability to run some of our traditional tests like Geekbench 6 (which on Pixels often can’t be installed prior to a device’s official on-sale date), I noticed significantly shorter loading times in some of my favorite games.\n\n\n\n\n   Sam Rutherford for Engadget \n \n\nBooting up Sword of Convallaria only took 14 seconds, which is just one second longer than what I got recently from the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 and its Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chip. I recently clocked the Pixel 9 Pro Fold and its Tensor G4 processor taking 18 seconds to do the same task, so that’s a very encouraging improvement. And holding everything together is Google’s Material 3 Expressive UI for Android 16, which makes the whole OS feel snappier and more alive.\nSoftware: This is where the magic happens\nThe most tantalizing new feature on the Pixel 10 family is Magic Cue, because when it works, it really does feel like magic. If you allow it, it will look through your screenshots, calendar events, contacts, Gmail and Messages. So when someone texts you “Where are we getting dinner on Thursday?” that info appears in its own little animated rainbow bubble, exactly where you need it, instead of you needing to flip back and forth between multiple apps. It’s like your phone is actually looking out for you and wants to simplify things by cutting out tedious steps. Plus, all of this happens on device, so there’s no need to send your data into the wild wild web.\n\n\n\n   You can see that Magic Cue can't answer every question and doesn't work for events more than 10 days out, but when it does you'll see little rainbow buttons pop up with pertinent info or links to helpful apps. \n \n\n   Sam Rutherford for Engadget \n \n\nIn addition to reservations, if someone asks if you’re free, Magic Cue will pull up a shortcut to your calendar to make sure there aren't any conflicts. It can also retrieve flight info (or call the airline directly), phone numbers and more. And sometime later in September, Google is adding the ability for Magic Cue to send photos of a specific person or pet when they come up in conversation.\nOn the flipside, for all the times when Magic Cue feels like wizardry, there are just as many limitations. For example, if an event hasn’t been entered into your calendar (like a work event planned in Slack) , Google’s AI may not be able to find it. Magic Cue also doesn’t work on appointments that are more than 10 days away. And perhaps my biggest issue is that even within Google’s own first-party software, Magic Cue isn’t supported in Google Chat, not to mention the vast sea of third-party messaging apps like Discord, Line, etc. That’s a problem because those services have largely replaced texting for me. Now I’m sure Google will expand Magic Cue support to more apps in the future, but this is how it works right now.\n\n\n\n\n   Sam Rutherford for Engadget \n \n\nIt’s a similar situation for another new feature: natural sounding on-the-fly voice translation in calls. I rarely answer calls in general nowadays, let alone calls in a language I can’t speak. But when this works, it’s damn impressive and my relatives said the AI-generated voice sounded a bit like me (though the lack of support for Chinese seems like a strange omission). Same goes for Take a Message, which can create real-time transcripts (similar to Live Voicemail on iPhone) when you miss a call that you might have otherwise wanted to answer. To me, it’s a more modern take on voicemail, the difference being that Google will send the transcript to you as a text message as well. But once again, how often do people do that? For me, it’s become increasingly rare, but your mileage may vary.\nThat said, I do like the new Daily Hub as a way to make the far left panel on the Pixel 10 Pro’s homescreen more useful. It puts upcoming events, the forecast and interesting videos and articles (tailored to me, of course) all in one place, but I wish the box for it was a bit larger. On the flipside, I’m still kind of out on the Pixel Journal app. I’ve never been a big Dear Diary person and I’m not sure a digital version will get me to pick up the habit. But I do appreciate that it tries to surface things like the coolest photos you took on a certain day while encouraging you to be more introspective, or prompting you to keep track of things like fitness goals. Plus, you can lock it behind a PIN or biometrics to keep prying eyes away from your inner thoughts.\nCameras: Enhance mode activated\n\n\n\n\n   Sam Rutherford for Engadget \n \n\nWhile the physical hardware behind the Pixel 10 Pro’s 50MP main, 48MP ultrawide and 48MP telephoto cameras hasn’t changed much, its photo skills got a bump thanks to improved software. Now with support for full resolution portrait shots, the Pixel 10 Pros can capture a new level of detail which is generally great, unless you’re like me and you instantly cringe when you can see every single pore on your face. That said, all those pixels put more strain on processing power. I noticed that anytime I shot more than three max-res pics in a row, the phone has to pause while it cleared out its buffer before letting me snap any more. That isn’t great if you’re trying to capture candid reactions.\nIf you’re looking for guidance, Camera Coach does a surprisingly good job providing step-by-step instructions on how to improve your pics. Or, if you need inspiration, it can also suggest some more outside-the-box compositions. The downside to all this is that it does ask more of the user. Instead of just opening the camera app when you want to snap a quick pic, you need to carve out time to see how far Camera Coach’s AI-powered advice can really take you. This may result in more trial and error than some folks will really want to deal with. But considering this is a very optional learning tool, that last part isn’t a big deal.\nThis brings us to the new natural language editing powers in Google Photos. Instead of needing to fool around with sliders or figure out how to use an app like Lightroom or Photoshop, you can simply tell the Pixel 10 what changes to make and it will do it. This might be the most powerful new tool on the entire phone, because instead of needing to know about things like levels, curves or exposure, I was able to simply ask the Pixel 10 Pro to brighten my photo and voila, suddenly (well, after a few seconds of waiting) I had a low-light picture that was easier to see.\nAs a fan of telephoto photography, my favorite new camera feature is easily Pro Res Zoom. By taking the 5x optical lens and combining it with the power of on-device generative AI, the Pixel 10 Pro line can shoot at up to 100x. Sure, it’s not perfect and the results aren’t as good as real glass, but that’s not really an option for phones. And when I compared what Pro Res Zoom captured at 100x compared to what a Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra produced at the same magnification, the Pixel 10 Pro XL’s shot was sharper, more detailed and just better looking in almost every way. However, there are some limitations on Pro Res Zoom when taking long range shots of people that may cause you to fall back on 20x Super Res Zoom in certain situations.\n\n\n\n\n   Sam Rutherford for Engadget \n \n\nStill, all this feels weird because I remember a time when scenes from CSI where people yelling “Enhance” at a computer in order to create magically crystal clear zoom images from extreme digital crops felt like a meme. But now, that’s not very far off from what the latest round of Google’s AI-powered enhancements have given us.\nWhen it comes to standard daytime and low-light shots, Google’s image processing remains unmatched. Nighttime pics are brighter and more accurate while the Pixel 10 Pro XL more capably preserved things like highlights in my photo of some garden-raised tomatoes.\nBattery life and charging\nThe Pixel 10 Pro and Pro XL feature 4,870mAh and 5,200mAh batteries respectively, which are up from the 4,700mAh and 5,060mAh cells on last year’s phones. This translated into runtimes of 27 hours and 24 minutes for the 10 Pro and 28:01 for the 10 Pro XL — both healthy increases from the 25 hours of life we saw previously from the Pixel 9 Pro. And in the real world, Google’s latest handsets felt even more efficient than that, often ending the day with upwards of 35 percent juice left in the tank.\n\n\n\n\n   Sam Rutherford for Engadget \n \n\nAs for charging, wired speeds for both phones have gotten a small boost with the 10 Pro now topping out at 30 watts (up from 27W) or 40 watts (up from 37W) for the 10 Pro XL. However, the biggest upgrade when it comes to charging convenience is the addition of official magnetic Qi2 wireless support, or what Google is calling Pixelsnap. This means the entire Pixel 10 line now works with a huge range of accessories (including most MagSafe peripherals for the iPhone) that makes it easy to slap a wireless puck on the back without having to worry about if it's properly aligned or not.\nFurthermore, while wireless charging speeds for the 10 Pro are staying the same at 15 watts, the 10 Pro XL can now go up to 25 watts. Unfortunately, there still aren’t that many compatible accessories that support charging at that speed. But between Google’s new family of Pixelsnap peripherals and increased adoption for Qi2 as a whole, that won’t be the case for long. So if you care about getting the Pixel with the fastest charging speeds, the 10 Pro XL is what you want.\n\n\n\n   Thanks to the addition of Pixelsnap magnetic charging, Pixel 10 Pro and Pixel 10 Pro XL are now compatible with the vast majority of Qi2 wireless charging accessories including this previously available battery pack from Anker. \n \n\n   Sam Rutherford for Engadget \n \n\nThe one small downgrade for 2025 is that the Pixel 10 family no longer supports reverse wireless powersharing (aka Battery Share), which is a feature that has been available on several previous generations of Google phones. I will fully admit that this feature was never something I used everyday. But every now and then I would find myself with a gadget that needed some juice, and even if it was slow, it was really nice to be able to bestow some excess energy upon a device without a cable.\nWrap-up\nNow that we can look back at 10 generations of devices, Google’s overarching strategy is more convincing than ever. For the Pixel 10 Pro and 10 Pro XL, the company has combined iterative hardware upgrades with a solid (and attractive) design while its software and AI continues to outpace its rivals. Even though Magic Cue doesn’t work for everything and is limited to a handful of first-party apps, it feels like the omniscient computers from sci-fi shows and movies have finally been beamed into a device to help us organize our lives. Then you tack on support for high-res portraits and an AI-powered zoom that produces results better than the base optics ever could on their own and you get what might be the most versatile mobile cameras around. And let’s not forget all the great existing Google tools and features like the Pixel Recorder, Call Screener and more.\n\n\n\n\n   Sam Rutherford for Engadget \n \n\nFor the past couple years, my wife has been asking me if this is the year to upgrade. And up until now, I’ve said she’s better off waiting. But with the Pixel 10 Pro and Pro XL, unless you’re a hardcore gamer or high-level mobile creator who might actually notice a difference in performance, or have need for a stylus, Google’s latest handsets are the smartest picks.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/google-pixel-10-pro-and-pro-xl-review-redefining-the-smart-in-smartphone-170031073.html?src=rss",

Here is another comparison of the Google Pixel 10 Pro XL and Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra using their built-in 5x optical zoom lenses. In very low light, Google's Night Sight mode still reigns supreme thanks to much sharper details and a more pleasing exposure. And when I compared what Pro Res Zoom captured at 100x compared to what a Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra produced at the same magnification, the Pixel 10 Pro XL’s shot was sharper, more detailed and just better looking in almost every way. Now that we can look back at 10 generations of devices, Google’s overarching strategy is more convincing than ever."

    "summary": "Welcome to Video Games Weekly on Engadget. Expect a new story every Monday or Tuesday, broken into two parts. The first is a space for short essays and ramblings about video game trends and related topics from me, Jess Conditt, a reporter who's covered the industry for more than 13 years. The second contains the video game stories from the past week that you need to know about, including some headlines from outside of Engadget.\nPlease enjoy — and I'll see you next week.\n\nThe climbing genre is not a monolith. That is to say, there’s plenty of variation in the realm of mountaineering games, from mechanically driven cliff-scaling sims to silly multiplayer survival experiences, but they tend to share the same premise: Reach the peak. You’re miles from civilization, with no vehicles and a limited backpack of equipment, and directly in front of you, there’s a mountain. Ascend.\nAll you have is your body and mental fortitude against an overwhelming physical challenge, and your step-by-step journey is the story. There’s an obvious symbolism to these games, offering a cliff face as the manifestation of impossibility, hopelessness, oppression or fear, alongside a surface-level message about never giving up, trying again and generally hanging in there. Cat poster vibes, but an ever-relevant and poignant lesson nonetheless.\nToday, though — particularly after spending time playing the Cairn and Baby Steps demos, and watching PEAK streams — I want to focus on the other half of the climbing-game equation. The part where you fall, over and over and over again. Your grip slips, your leg doesn’t bend that way, your energy depletes, and your body tumbles down the mountain, bouncing off boulders and crashing into trees, leaving you bloody and broken and right back where you started. Or, at the very least, staining your onesie with mud. \nI’m learning to appreciate these moments. In mountaineering games, falling tends to generate the most powerful reaction in players, whether that’s immediate laughter (PEAK) or grim frustration (Cairn), and this is an admirable quality. It’s easy to argue that the fall is more important than the climb, because without the lush bed of emotion generated by the constant threat of slipping and tumbling and restarting, reaching the peak wouldn’t feel that special at all. There’s context in the fall, and with that, there comes a sliver of peace.\nWhen you spend all your time climbing, it’s easy to forget that falling is actually the most natural thing you can do. Next time you’re on your way down, try to make peace with the fall.\nOK — we’ve gone from motivational cat posters to new-age cult speak, so I’ll get to the point. There are a notable number of mountain-based games in the zeitgeist at the moment and I just wanted to shout them out because they’re all pretty incredible in their own ways.\nCairn is a climbing simulator, endurance test and survival game in one gorgeous package, complete with music by Furi composer The Toxic Avenger, French artist Gildaa, and Martin Stig Andersen, who did the soundtracks for Control, LIMBO and INSIDE. Climb absolutely anywhere, manage your inventory by shaking your backpack, bandage your wounds, forage for food and sleep under the stars. Cairn comes from Furi studio The Game Bakers and it’s due out on November 5 for PlayStation 5 and Steam; the demo is available on both platforms now.\nBaby Steps is a different kind of mountain-scaling game, and one could argue that it doesn’t even belong in the same category as something like Cairn, but I believe you’ll find that it does. Baby Steps adheres to the established premise of the climbing genre — reach the peak — and it features a distant mountaintop as the main waypoint for Nate, a lost and lonely man in a gray onesie. Nate is essentially a dude-sized baby learning how to walk, and creators Maxi Boch, Gabe Cuzzillo and Bennett Foddy are infusing his journey with the appropriate amount of hilarity and mechanical intrigue. Baby Steps is published by Devolver Digital and it’s heading to PC and PS5 on September 23, a date that was recently pushed back to avoid the curse of Hollow Knight: Silksong. (More on that below).\nPEAK is the thing all the cool kids are playing this summer, and as a fadingly hip not-kid who prefers solo games and familiar FPSes, I can attest it’s entertaining to watch and looks like a lot of fun to play. PEAK is a co-op climbing game with simple 3D models and deceptively challenging mountains to summit, each with four biomes. The map updates each day so there’s a steady stream of fresh climbing content, and the proximity voice chat works exceptionally well. I particularly like that players get to live on as little ghosts after they die. PEAK comes from indie studio Team PEAK and it’s on Steam for $8.\nAnd why not, I’ll shout out some other modern, but not as recent, mountain-based favorites of mine: Jusant, Celeste, GIRP and Journey are all pretty spectacular.\nEnjoy the climb — and the fall.\n\nThe news\nA selection of indie and AA games I’m looking forward to that aren’t Silksong\nBaby Steps is the latest game to change its release date in order to get out of the way of Hollow Knight: Silksong, which is coming out on September 4. Team Cherry dropped the release date in a trailer on August 21 and since then, at least eight indie studios have delayed their own games to avoid the Silksong window. It’s lovely to see Silksong have its day in the sun, but personally, I’m more interested in playing Baby Steps in full.\nWith that said, here’s a sampling of indie and AA games I’m anticipating that aren’t Silksong, in no particular order and right off the top of my head:\n\nBye Sweet Carole (October 9, 2025)\nKeeper (October 17, 2025)\nReanimal (TBA)\nLittle Nightmares III (October 9, 2025)\nPlease, Watch the Artwork (2025)\nBuilding Relationships (2025)\nMixtape (2025)\nCrisol: Theater of Idols (2025)\nUNBEATABLE (November 6, 2025)\nBig Walk (2026)\nGrave Seasons (2026)\nPetal Runner (2026)\nHades 2 (live in early access, 1.0 imminent)\nPossessor(s) (2025)\nNeverway (2026)\nDenshattack! (2026)\nAbsolum (October 9, 2025)\nSkate Story (2025)\nCronos: The New Dawn (September 5, 2025)\nLumines Arise (November 11, 2025)\nRelooted (TBA)\nEscape Academy 2: Back 2 School (2026)\nBlighted (2026)\n\nAnd obviously, Baby Steps (September 23, 2025) and Cairn (November 5, 2025).\nA date for skate.\nElectronic Arts has revived the Skate series after 15 years, and the (very youthfully styled) skate. is primed to hit early access on September 16 across PlayStation 4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S and PC. The new skate. is a shift for the series: It’s a free, online, open-world experience with microtransactions (but nothing in the pay-to-win realm, according to EA). The early access version will be free, too, of course.\nThe scariest part of Silent Hill f might be its mental health awareness\nYou’ll find this one alongside Resident Evil Requiem and Pragmata in my AAA-inclusive list of games I’m most looking forward to, and Engadget UK Bureau Chief Mat Smith’s preview from Gamescom is only making me more stoked on it. Silent Hill f is set in a remote village in 1960s Japan and stars a schoolgirl named Hinako. Here’s a bit of Mat’s take after a two-hour demo, which involved a scarecrow confrontation and marionette attacks:\n\nSilent Hill f is due out on PS5, PC and Xbox Series X/S on September 25, 2025.\nOVERWATCH 2 STADIUM GET'S ITS BIGGEST UDPATE EVER!\nRemember when I said I liked playing familiar FPSes? Overwatch 2 is my kind of decompression. With season 18, Blizzard is changing how hero progression is displayed, adding color-coded borders and top-hero cards to the character-selection process. The aim is to make it clearer how skilled you are with any given character, and also share this information with teammates and enemies in a way that won’t enable trolling during the ban phase. The progression 2.0 developer notes are here, if you’re interested. Season 18 also brings keyboard and mouse support to consoles, but those players will be thrown into the PC matchmaking pool, and introduces the water-bending support hero Wuyang.\nOverwatch 2 Season 18 went live today, August 26. My colleague and fellow Overwatch 2 player Kris Holt spotted two egregious copy errors in the new season’s welcome screen, captured for posterity below:\nOverwatch 2 Season 18's welcome screenBlizzard\nPete Parsons leaves Bungie\nBungie’s longtime leader has left the studio and the Destiny community couldn’t be happier. Pete Parsons has taken a lot of heat for the stale state of the company’s shooter (and the size of his car collection), but it’s more likely the whole art theft, bungled launch and indefinite delay of Marathon led to his departure. New CEO Justin Truman, who at one point ran Destiny 2 and most recently was the company’s “chief development officer,” has his work cut out to win back fans.\nAdditional reading\n\nKris Holt’s indie game roundup\nPlayStation Boss Says Company Now Does 'Much More Rigorous and More Frequent Testing' After Concord's Failure - IGN\n\n\nHave a tip for Jessica?

The first is a space for short essays and ramblings about video game trends and related topics from me, Jess Conditt, a reporter who's covered the industry for more than 13 years. Next time you’re on your way down, try to make peace with the fall. Baby Steps is a different kind of mountain-scaling game, and one could argue that it doesn’t even belong in the same category as something like Cairn, but I believe you’ll find that it does. Baby Steps is published by Devolver Digital and it’s heading to PC and PS5 on September 23, a date that was recently pushed back to avoid the curse of Hollow Knight: Silksong. I particularly like that players get to live on as little ghosts after they die.

    "summary": "It’s been a while since Tim Schafer’s done press briefings, he admits. The head of Double Fine, a studio best known for the Psychonauts series, is trying to explain Keeper, a puzzle adventure game where you are, literally, a sentient, walking lighthouse. Double Fine is now one of several studios bought up by Microsoft and the team apparently took the opportunity to lean into all the resources available and, he said, “make something weird.”\n\nIt’s definitely that. The colors and atmosphere of Keeper have at least the touch of Psychonauts DNA. Keeper puts players in control of the aforementioned lighthouse, awakened (and joined) by a curious, occasionally aggressive, bird named Twig.  Interestingly, the lighthouse currently has no name.\nDouble Fine's art director, Lee Petty came up with the concept for the game, apparently inspired by his time spent hiking during the COVID-19 pandemic. This is reflected in a lot of ways, whether its the rolling hills and landscapes that the anthropomorphised lighthouse roams, or the fact that there’s not a single word of dialogue. The interactions between the bird and building, which seem to pepper both cutscenes and gameplay, are like Pixar shorts.\nThe environments have a drippy surrealist style to them to, and the lack of a map, health bar or any HUD at all means you’re not distracted as you explore and solve puzzles.\nIn some early gameplay footage, I saw how the lighthouse's main form of interaction comes from its light beam. Not only does this help you seek out pathways and objects, but it can also be focused on the countless skittering creatures. Sometimes this causes creatures to flee, while other times they’ll offer up magical orbs willingly and unwillingly, which open up later areas or bring towering creatures (structures?) to life. In Double Fine fashion, things look weird, too, with melted mountain peaks with more than a dost of Dali.\nYou don't have to attack everything, either. During three different gameplay demos, I watched all kinds of creatures hide, run, and just exist in this world where humanity has long since disappeared. Oh there’s briefly a giant flying whale too.\nUsing the lighthouse’s beam on certain things will leave an twinkling spark behind, meaning that Twig the bird can interact with it. During a later segment, the lighthouse can manipulate time, turning its bird companion back into an egg while a building repairs itself — and frees up a pathway. Twig remains an egg for a while until later, when the lighthouse can fast-forward time. Abilities like this seem location-dependent, rather than a Metroidvania collection of skills built up over the game. At another juncture, the lighthouse walks into a cloud of pink fluffy mist, unlocking the ability to jump and float around levels.\nDouble Fine\nSchafer says the themes of life-changing and metamorphosis will continue to bubble up during Keeper and the lighthouse and bird duo is clearly central to all of it. It reminds me a little of Banjo Kazooie (the latter was a bird) but also Ico; at one point, the seemingly impervious lighthouse loses its footing, but Twig willfully tries to drag their partner to safety. Did Twig even help? Maybe not, but the sentiment was there.\nKeeper will launch on Xbox Series S|X and PC on October 17th, including Xbox Game Pass.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/doublefine-keeper-gameplay-gamescom2025-123038715.html?src=rss",

Twig remains an egg for a while until later, when the lighthouse can fast-forward time. Abilities like this seem location-dependent, rather than a Metroidvania collection of skills built up over the game. At another juncture, the lighthouse walks into a cloud of pink fluffy mist, unlocking the ability to jump and float around levels. It reminds me a little of Banjo Kazooie (the latter was a bird) but also Ico; at one point, the seemingly impervious lighthouse loses its footing, but Twig willfully tries to drag their partner to safety."

    "summary": "The best iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Pro cases do more than just guard against drops — they can add MagSafe compatibility, extra grip, built-in stands or even a touch of luxury. Whether you're after slim and stylish, rugged and shockproof or something that adds a bit of personality, there’s a case to match every need. With so many options to choose from, finding the best iPhone case overall depends on how you use your phone day to day. Maybe you need something minimal for pockets, or maybe you're after serious protection for travel and outdoor use. Either way, we’ve rounded up the best picks for both the iPhone 16 and 16 Pro, so you don’t have to waste time scrolling through endless listings.\nBest iPhone 16 cases for 2025\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBest iPhone 16 case FAQs\nWhat is the most protective brand of phone cases?\nThere is no one \"most protective\" brand of phone cases, but rather there are many that tout extra security for your handset. Some of the most protective phone cases we've tried come from Otterbox; most of the brand's cases have a bit more protection than your standard phone case, even the ones that are designed to be on the slim side. Otterbox also makes a wide variety of phone cases, so there's a good chance you'll find one that suits your style and provides the level of protection you're looking for. Otterbox's Defender series is one of the best you can get if you care first and foremost about making sure your phone survives all kinds of accidents (save for a dunk in a pool). \nSilicone vs hard case: Which one is better?\nNeither silicone nor hard cases are better than the other. Silicone cases tend to be thinner and feel soft to the touch, and they're often easier to put on and take off of phones. Hard cases can be on the thicker side, but they provide a bit more drop protection than silicone cases. Which type of case is best for you depends on the type of experience you want from your phone. It's also worth nothing that both silicone cases and hard cases come in a variety of colors, designs and styles, so you have plenty of choose from to match your personality on both sides.\nDoes an iPhone 16 need a screen protector?\nThe iPhone 16 features Apple’s tough Ceramic Shield front, which is definitely more durable than standard glass — but it’s not invincible. If you want to avoid scratches from keys, drops onto pavement or just the wear and tear of daily use, a screen protector is still a smart move. It adds an extra layer of defense without getting in the way of touch sensitivity or Face ID. So, while it’s not absolutely essential, using one is a good idea if you want to keep your screen looking flawless for the long haul.\nIs the iPhone 16 drop-proof?\nThe iPhone 16 is built to be tough, with Ceramic Shield on the front and a sturdy aluminum or titanium frame (depending on the model), but it’s not completely drop-proof. It can handle the occasional bump or short fall, especially if it lands on a flat surface — but drops on concrete or at awkward angles can still cause cracks or damage. If you’re prone to butterfingers, pairing your iPhone 16 with a durable case and maybe even a screen protector is the best way to play it safe.\nGeorgie Peru contributed to this report.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-iphone-cases-153035988.html?src=rss",

These thin cases are a bit rougher around the edges than Spigen’s cases, literally – Gripmunk covers have textured edges that make them easier to grip and less likely to slip out of your hands, while the backs of the cases show off cute patterns and designs like floral arrays, cosmic scenes and more. This wallet case can hold up to three credit cards and a few notes of cash. What’s more, Pela cases are available for a wide array of handsets. Peak Design Peak Design Everyday Case Features: MagSafe | Material: Recycled nylon canvas | Availability: iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Pro cases out now Peak Design’s Everyday Case not only looks attractive, but it turns your phone into a bunch of different things when you pair it with any of the accessories in the company’s mobile ecosystem. The company’s mobile tripod is one of our favorites for taking better photos with your phone, but also propping it up any which way you need.

    "summary": "A good fast charger can make a world of difference when you're low on battery and short on time. With more devices — from smartphones to laptops — supporting quick-charging tech, having an accessory that can deliver serious power in minutes is almost essential. Many newer phones no longer come with charging bricks in the box, so picking up a reliable fast charger will be essential for most people. Whether you're at home, at work or on the move, the right charger can help keep your gear topped up without wasting time.Today’s fast chargers come in all shapes and sizes. You’ll find compact wall plugs perfect for travel, multi-port hubs for charging several devices at once and GaN (gallium nitride) chargers that offer powerful performance in a smaller footprint. Some support multiple charging standards like USB Power Delivery (PD) and Qualcomm Quick Charge, making them great for everything from iPhones to Android phones, tablets and even some laptops. In this guide, we’ll help you find the best fast chargers for your setup, so you can spend less time tethered to an outlet and more time getting things done.\nBest fast chargers for 2025\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhat to consider before buying a fast charger\nBefore you start looking at specific chargers, it's critical to determine three things: how many devices do you need to charge, how much power do they require and whether or not you're planning on traveling with any of them. \nThe reason for the first question is simple. If you only need to charge a single device, like an iPhone or Android phone, it's cheaper and usually more space-efficient to get a lower-wattage phone charger with one port instead of two or three. Next, it's critical to figure out how much electricity your gadgets need because it doesn't make sense to buy a power brick that pushes out more juice than your device can actually use. This may sound a bit tricky, but most major manufacturers will list a product's max charging speeds in its tech specs, which is typically denoted by a specific wattage (15W, for example) or a quick-charge rating.\nUnfortunately, very powerful or large laptops like gaming notebooks can suck a ton of juice (more than 140 watts), which means they may rely on more traditional power adapters with barrel plugs. This may result in them not being compatible with universal chargers. Some of these PCs may also support charging over USB-C, so even if a specific adapter can't deliver its full power draw, it can still send over some energy — but it will do so at a slower rate compared to the laptop's included charger. To get the best performance, using a fast charging cable, such as a USB-C cable, can make a big difference in maintaining consistent power delivery.\nFor frequent travelers, size and weight are often important considerations, because the bigger and heavier a charger is, the more annoying it will be to lug around. You'll also want to think about other factors like support for international plugs, which can be a big help to anyone who regularly visits other countries. If you’re already traveling with power banks or a charging station, choosing a compact GaN charger can help streamline your gear.\nFinally, you'll want to figure out if your smartphone uses a proprietary charging standard or if it's compatible with the USB Power Delivery spec (USB PD). For example, the OnePlus 13's included SuperVOOC power adapter can send up to 100 watts to the phone. However, if you use a generic USB-PD charger, speeds top out at 45 watts. That’s still pretty quick, but not nearly as fast as OnePlus' brick — and the same applies to devices with super fast charging support. Also, make sure your charging cable and connector are up to spec, as lower-quality accessories can bottleneck your charging speeds.\nFast charger FAQs\nWhat is GaN?\nWhen looking for chargers, you may notice that some are marked as GaN, which stands for gallium nitride. This is an important distinction because, when compared to older adapters that use silicon switches, GaN-based devices support increased power efficiency and output, allowing manufacturers to create more compact bricks that run cooler and support higher wattages.\nDepending on the specific power output, GaN adapters can be 30 to 50 percent smaller and lighter than silicon-based alternatives. That might not sound like much, but when they’re sitting in a bag alongside a laptop and a half dozen other accessories you might have, cutting down on excess bulk and weight goes a long way.\nDo fast chargers affect battery life?\nTechnically yes, because the process of sending a ton of watts into a gadget and potentially generating additional heat while doing so can decrease battery health over time. That said, modern devices and chargers use various protocols to ensure temperatures and power levels stay within preset limits — in large part to avoid damaging the product or creating a safety risk. At a base level, simply charging a gadget regardless of speed will cause degradation over time (nothing stays perfect forever, you know?). So as long as you use compatible chargers and cables, the impact of fast charging is generally quite negligible.\nWhat's the difference between a fast charger and a regular charger?\nThere isn't a single generally accepted definition of fast charging. However, with power adapters capable of sending as little as five watts or less, it's important to know how much juice your device is getting, especially if you need to recharge something quickly. So depending on who you ask (particularly when it comes to smartphones), any charger that can push out more than 15 to 18 watts is generally considered to be \"fast.\" That said, with some phones capable of receiving more than 100 watts and up to 240 watts for some laptops, it's more important than ever to consider what devices you own before buying a new fast charger.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-fast-chargers-140011033.html?src=rss",

It's exceedingly affordable at under $20 while providing excellent charging speeds for its size. Like Anker’s model, it has three ports (one of which is USB-A) and a similar max power output. The one small issue is that it may block adjacent outlets if plugged into a crowded power strip due to its thin yet wide design. You also get four USB-C ports (though nothing in the way of USB-C) and a less premium plastic body, but those are very reasonable trade-offs for something with a more affordable price of $120.
