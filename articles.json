    "summary": "I’m not going to beat around the bush: iPadOS 26 and its new multitasking features are a game-changer for Apple’s tablets. Pretty much ever since Steve Jobs introduced the iPad 15 years ago (!), Apple has tried to straddle two worlds. In one, the iPad is a super-simple, easy-to-use tablet with a gorgeous display and tons of good apps from the App Store for gaming, entertainment and light work. The other world is one where the iPad replaces your traditional computer, letting people do the serious work that’s been typically reserved for a Mac or Windows PC. iPadOS has too often served as a hindrance to the latter goal over the years, particularly as the iPad Pro has gotten more powerful.\nThe Stage Manager multitasking experience Apple introduced with iPadOS 16 in 2022 was a major step towards making the iPad’s software suitable for power users — but it was rather buggy at launch and not as flexible as iPad power users were hoping for. The calls to just put macOS on the iPad grew louder. But this year, Apple took a different approach: it brought crucial macOS features like the familiar “stoplight” window controls, the menu bar at the top of the screen and vastly improved window management tools to iPadOS 26. The result is an iPad experience where you can easily jump between multiple windowed apps set up just how you like and one where you go full screen to focus on your content. It’s a massive refinement over the old Stage Manager experience and one that I think will finally satisfy iPad die-hards who want to push their tablets to the limit.\nBefore diving into the details, a quick word on betas and stability. As usual, Apple’s public betas feel pretty stable and capable, but that doesn’t mean you won’t run into weirdness here and there. App crashes, particularly with third-party apps, happened far more on this beta than with iPadOS 18. I’m confident those things will be ironed out as more developers update their apps for the new OS, but you’ll also run into things like UI inconsistencies and occasional stutters and jerkiness when jumping between apps. As we always say, think hard about what you’re willing to put up with to try a beta, even the relatively stable public beta. After all, the final version of iPadOS 26 will be out in just a few months.\n(Ed. note: Apple just released the public betas for iOS 26, iPadOS 26, macOS 26 and watchOS 26. This means, as Nate stated above, you can run the preview for yourself, if you are willing to risk potentially buggy software. As usual, we highly recommend backing up all your date before running any beta, and you can follow our guide on how to install Apple's public betas to do so.)\nMultitasking\nTime for the nitty-gritty. When you update to iPadOS 26, you’ll be asked if you want to enable multitasking or have apps run in full screen mode only. When Apple says full screen only, they mean it. Past versions of iPadOS offered either Stage Manager or a basic, two-app split screen view with a third app available in a Slide Over window. The latter option is gone now, though you can still easily set up two or three apps side by side with  iPadOS 26’s window tiling features. You can use multitasking mode or full screen only, with no in between. I think that’s a smart move, as plenty of people who use an iPad probably never use these multi-app features, and having a “multitasking on or off” toggle keeps things simple.\nWhen you turn on multitasking mode, apps still open in full screen first — but you can grab any corner of the window to resize it or touch the top of the app and drag it around the screen. You could already do this with Stage Manager, so what really sets this new mode apart is how it interacts with other windows. Swiping up from the bottom of the display reveals the usual Home Screen view, but with your apps tucked to the side as a visual cue that you can add another app to that group. And, as before, you can move, resize and stack that app window wherever you want.\n\nAs I’m writing this, I have nine separate app windows open on my iPad, and getting around them feels more Mac-like than ever before. I can swipe up and hold from the bottom of the Home Screen and see every open app in a smaller window, which makes finding the specific thing I want a lot easier; I can also just command-tab through them. Apps can be minimized down to the dock and when I want the app back, it’ll pop open in the same size window and same placement as before. Swiping up from the bottom of the screen twice minimizes everything I have open to start fresh — but again, if I reopen those apps, they’ll go back to exactly where I had them set up before.\nI realize it sounds kind of silly to make a big deal of this, but it’s hard to overstate how much this improves the iPad multitasking experience. With Stage Manager, I was never quite sure where an app would open or if it would be full screen or windowed. It can be useful for setting up multiple groups of apps, but adding and removing apps from that view was not terribly intuitive. Just opening everything in one space is a lot more intuitive. And if you want to have various different spaces with specific apps, you can still turn on Stage Manager. It’s a lot easier to add and remove apps from various different groups than it used to be; minimizing a window puts it into its own space that you can add more apps to (or just use it on its own).\n\nThere are a few other new components that make multitasking work as well as it does. These should be quite familiar to Mac users: The three-button “stoplight” controls and the menu bar. The stoplight buttons replace a similar three-dot window management system from older versions of iPadOS but are far more intuitive. The red one closes an app window entirely, the green one makes a window full screen and then yellow one minimizes it to the dock. These controls are crucial to making iPadOS 26 feel more flexible and fluid than ever before, particularly if you want to have more than one window of a single app open. I’ve also found them to be crucial when working with multiple apps on a smaller display, like on the 11-inch iPad Pro. Stage Manager usually felt like more trouble than it was worth on anything but a 13-inch iPad, but these new multitasking features make it easy to flip through a bunch of apps and pop into full screen if I need more space.\nThe expanded window tiling controls here also make that easier. If you press and hold the stoplight buttons, you’ll get more options to resize apps to take up a quarter, third or half the screen; you can also grab drag bars to further adjust how much space each app takes up. I really liked a mode where three iPhone-sized apps fill the screen, and when there was something I wanted to devote more focus to, I just hit its green button and went full screen.\n\nThe menu bar, meanwhile, is pretty easy to explain. If you swipe down from the top of the screen (or move your trackpad cursor up to the top) you’ll see familiar menus like File, Edit, Window and so on. It’s a handy way to find more advanced controls for an app, and it also keeps the various toolbars in apps from getting too overloaded with options.\nLong story short, this all adds up to a wildly improved iPad experience. It doesn’t compromise the single-screen, focused mode that the iPad has always been known for, and it greatly improves working across multiple windows and apps. And unlike Stage Manager, which was limited to M-series iPads, these new multitasking features will work on any iPad that can run iPadOS 26, including the base A16 iPad and the iPad mini.\nEverything else\nIf this was the only change to iPadOS Apple made this year, it would already be a worthwhile upgrade, but there are a bunch of other improvements coming this fall. These include an improved Files app, the Preview app that has long been a core part of macOS, the new Liquid Glass design, some potentially useful Apple Intelligence features, a nice set of updates to the Messaging app and a new Phone app.\nMuch has been said about Liquid Glass, with tons of prognostication about how Apple was ruining usability and throwing its UI back to 2006 in a blatant Windows Aero ripoff. As usual, the truth is much more nuanced. No one familiar with Apple’s software will be thrown off by this update — everything works as it did before, and while you’ll definitely notice some refractive visual elements, it’s not the wholesale change that aggrieved social media posters would have you believe. You can make things look very different if you, say, opt for the new clear glass icon look, but you can also leave the standard colorful iOS icons in place.\nThe Music app’s Now Playing bar is a perfect place to see iPadOS 26’s Liquid Glass transparency in action.\nOver the course of the developer betas Apple has released since WWDC, the company has responded to feedback and reduced some of the transparency effects that were present in the first version of Liquid Glass — as it turns out, submitting feedback during a beta works!  (Interestingly, they bumped some of the transparency back up in the fourth developer beta, right after turning it down in beta 3. This is still a work in progress.) Probably the biggest functional change is that app controls, toolbars and sidebars float over apps in a new, distinct layer rather than being wholly separate from an app’s content — but again, it’s not the kind of thing that’ll faze anyone who has been using an iPad or any other Apple device.\nPreview isn’t exactly a thriller, but it’s a much better way to work with PDFs and images than the old interface that launched them in a separate Files window. You can still find PDFs in Files easily enough, but actually dealing with the document in a separate app is better than making Files pull double duty.\nApple\nSpeaking of Files, it has even more in common with the Mac Finder than before. You can now put specific folders in the dock for faster access to whatever you’re working on, and the app list view has resizable columns and collapsible folders, just like on the Mac. You can also add emoji and colors to folders for more visual differentiation (and, let’s be honest, a little more fun). And for the first time, you can pick specific apps to open different file types by default — so if you’d rather have PNG images open in Photomator than Preview, go nuts.\nThere are also major updates to the communication experience across the board in iPadOS 26. The FaceTime app got a nice redesign with large contact posters of your recent calls. But what’s most handy here is that the FaceTime app no longer tries to do double-duty with voice calls. A dedicated Phone app handles that now. Assuming you also have an iPhone, you’ll see all your recent voice calls and voicemails here and you can quickly place a new call through your contact list or using a traditional dialer. I’ve always liked the idea of being able to place calls on devices I’m using during the work day like my Mac or iPad, and this makes it far easier.\nApple\nMessages is getting some fun visual enhancements like backgrounds for your conversations, but the thing I’m most interested in is message filtering. The app now identifies unknown senders and puts those messages in a separate folder, and there’s also a new spam folder where it drops messages that Apple strongly believes are spam.\nIf a message gets filtered into unknown senders or spam, you can mark it as known even if the contact isn’t in your address book and those messages will end up in your main view by default. The system also attempts to recognize when a message from an unknown sender is timely and needs to be delivered to your main inbox — something like a delivery person saying they’re nearby or other urgent content like a two-factor authentication code. This feels primarily like a phone-first feature; I get messages on my iPad, but haven’t seen much get filtered directly to spam or unknown callers yet. Once all my devices are running Apple’s latest software, we’ll see how that goes, but I’m still very excited about any feature that’ll help combat the deluge of spam messages that plague my inbox.\nFor more details on the updated communications experience and other new features like the Apple Intelligence-powered Live Translation, I’ll point you to my colleague Mat Smith’s iOS 26 overview. As is usually the case, nearly every feature coming to the iPhone this year is also coming to the iPad, meaning Live Translation will arrive on the tablet too.\nThere’s a lot more here that I haven’t been able to get to, like improved background tasks that let you export a video without keeping the app in focus, updates to Genmoji and Image Playground, the Journal app finally coming to iPad, Apple Intelligence-powered Shortcuts updates and much more. I’ll be continuing to check out how things change between now and the final release this fall, but even based on my experience with the recent beta, I’m quite pleased with where iPadOS 26 is at. The updates to multitasking are so significant that I can’t imagine going back to an iPad without them. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/ipados-26-preview-a-long-awaited-multi-tasking-update-pays-off-so-far-172522054.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "I've learned not to expect much from macOS updates — not through sheer cynicism, but from the obvious reality that Apple pays far more attention to iOS and iPadOS than its desktop platform. I get it. macOS is a thing of the past, while smartphones and tablets are Apple's profitable present and future. But still, I think Mac users deserve more than just widgets, or the ability to merely mirror their iPhones (a feature that's not only genuinely useful, but also cements how crucial iPhones are to Apple and its users today). Now with macOS 26, Apple is finally showing a bit more love to its laptops and desktops. \nAfter testing the macOS Tahoe 26 developer beta for a few weeks, it definitely feels like a more substantial update than the last few versions. The revamped Spotlight alone will likely delight Mac diehards, since it makes it easier to find apps and perform all manner of tasks without requiring your fingers leave the keyboard. Add in a lovely visual refresh thanks to Apple's Liquid Glass design, as well as enhanced iPhone continuity features, and you have an operating system that feels like a genuine step forward for the Mac faithful.\n(Ed. note: Apple just released the public betas for iOS 26, iPadOS 26, macOS 26 and watchOS 26. This means you can run the preview for yourself, if you are willing to risk potentially buggy or unstable software that could cause some of your apps to not work. As usual, we highly recommend backing up all your date before running any beta, and you can follow our guide on how to install Apple's public betas to do so.)\nSpotlight becomes more than a search engine\nI've never been a heavy Spotlight user, aside from the few times I've needed to quickly look for an app or file. But in macOS Tahoe 26, it's suddenly a lot more useful. Now Spotlight can also help you find specific files; search cloud file services and websites; run Apple shortcuts and automations; and even run basic commands, like looking up your recent screenshots when you type \"/screenshot.\" Spotlight has become more than just a search engine for your Mac, it's practically a super-powered command line. (And notably, it has no real equivalent on Windows. So once again, Mac power users will be able to gloat about the supremacy of macOS.)\nApple\nOver the course of my testing, tapping the command key and space bar to trigger Spotlight practically became second nature. I'd bring it up to find files, as usual, but I noticed that it was better at unearthing what I was looking for than before. Spotlight also replaced my usual practice of typing in search strings in Safari or Chrome's address bar. It takes just a few seconds to bring up Spotlight, type \"YouTube,\" hit tab to trigger the search box and type in the video I'm looking for. This intelligent site searching also works for Amazon and IMDB — hopefully, Apple will add more commonly used sites over time (or perhaps just the ability to map a site's internal search engine to Spotlight).\nIf you're often buried by tons of tabs in your web browser, Spotlight can also quickly search through them. That helped me avoid getting distracted by social media and Slack conversations. I could just stay in my productivity flow, since I didn't have to sift through multiple app windows and tabs. The ability to trigger actions from Spotlight was similarly useful — it's a cinch to pop it up, start typing \"Send Message\" and jot out a quick text to my wife. Spotlight also learns your most common commands over time, so now I just have to type \"se\" for the Send Message action to pop up.\nI'm sure for a certain type of Mac power user, Spotlight will give them far fewer reasons to ever touch their mouse or trackpad.\nApple\nA more refined user interface with Liquid Glass\nWhile Spotlight is the most powerful upgrade in macOS Tahoe 26, you'll notice the spiffier Liquid Glass interface first. As with iOS 26, it basically amounts to more transparencies and visual flourishes spread throughout the OS. The menu bar at the top of the screen is now fully transparent, instead of looking foggy like before. It's not much, but it does make your Mac's screen seem a little bigger (or perhaps that may have just been extra noticeable on the cramped 13-inch MacBook Air I've been testing on).\nSimilarly, widgets and the Control Center dropdown have more glass-like visual elements that make them look a bit more modern. There's no real practical advantage, but to paraphrase a classic Marge Simpson quote, I just think it's neat. Apple Silicon-equipped hardware has more than enough graphics power to spare, so these visual upgrades also don't hinder performance at all. I didn't notice any slowdown during my testing, and according to Activity Monitor, there didn't seem to be a big hit to CPU or GPU usage.\nApple\nBetter iPhone integration\nEven though you've been able to make phone calls on Macs for a while now through FaceTime, it's taken until macOS Tahoe 26 for Apple to debut a dedicated Phone app. The app itself is nothing special — it gives you a quick glance at your contacts and recent calls, all in a compact Liquid Glass window — but at least it's a more logical place for phone calls.\nEven better than the standalone app, though, is the addition of iPhone Live Activities appearing in the macOS Tahoe 26 menu bar. That makes it easier to keep track of an inbound Uber or Doordash order, without whipping out your phone. And if you need to tap into a specific activity, macOS will also automatically launch the app from your phone via iPhone mirroring. It's the sort of usability feature you'd expect from Apple, and notably it's also not easily replicable on Windows. (And sure, you can also view it as a way to keep iPhone users from straying to the dark side too.)\nOther useful upgrades\nThe more I dug into macOS Tahoe 26, the more intriguing it became. Here are a few other updates worth highlighting:\n\nThe Shortcuts app seems a lot more powerful now, especially with the addition of custom automations and Apple Intelligence-powered actions. You can have an automation trigger writing tools or Image Playgrounds, and there's also a new \"Use Model\" command that can tap into on-device AI models and ChatGPT. I'm still trying to wrap my head around building a complex automation, but conceivably it could let you do something like compare an audio transcript to text notes, according to Apple.\nSafari has received a Liquid Glass redesign that looks pretty polished. It's not nearly as transformative as the Safari iOS upgrade, which makes it easier to read websites on a small phone screen, but at least it looks nice.\nThe Notes app now has Apple Intelligence-powered reminders whenever you share content to it. That could help you unearth some key tasks from a large email.\nThe Photos app has also received the Liquid Glass treatment, and you can finally use Pinned Collections on Macs to keep your favorite photo groups handy.\nThe Apple Music app can now use AutoMix to intelligently blend songs together, similar to a DJ. I've been using this feature on iOS 26 a lot, and it's honestly delightful — so long as you're not a total gapless playback purist.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/macos-26-beta-preview-spotlights-time-to-shine-171700779.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "At WWDC 2025, Apple revealed a major visual shake-up for iOS (not to mention the rest of the company’s operating systems). This is the biggest change, aesthetically, since the shift away from the stitching, textures and skeuomorphic design of the iOS 4. It also comes with significantly fewer AI and Siri updates this time around. However, it’s the smaller touches that make iOS 26 seem like a notable improvement over its predecessor.\nI’ve been running the iOS 26 developer beta for the last two weeks and here's how Apple’s new Liquid Glass design — and iOS 26 broadly — stacks up.\n(Ed. note: Apple just released the public betas for iOS 26, iPadOS 26, macOS 26 and watchOS 26. This means you can run the preview for yourself, if you are willing to risk potentially buggy or unstable software that could cause some of your apps to not work. As usual, we highly recommend backing up all your date before running any beta, and you can follow our guide on how to install Apple's public betas to do so.)\nLiquid Glass changes everything\n\niOS 26 looks new and modern. And for once, how Apple describes it — liquid glass — makes sense: it’s a lot of layers of transparent elements overlapping and, in places, the animations are quite… liquidy. Menus and buttons will respond to your touch, with some of them coalescing around your finger and sometimes separating out into new menus.\nLiquid Glass encompasses the entire design of iOS. The home and lock screens have been redesigned once again, featuring a new skyscraping clock font that stretches out from the background of your photos, with ever-so-slight transparency. There’s also a new 3D effect that infuses your photos with a bit of spatial magic, offering a touch of Vision Pro for iPhone users.\nThe experience in the first few builds of the iOS 26 beta was jarring and messy, especially with transparent icons and notifications, due to those overlapping elements making things almost illegible. Updates across subsequent releases have addressed this issue by making floating elements more opaque. There is also a toggle within the Accessibility tab in Settings to reduce transparency further, but I hope Apple offers a slider so that users can choose exactly how “liquid” they want their “glass” to be. If you own other Apple products, then you’ll come to appreciate the design parity across your Mac, iPad and Apple Watch.\nOne noticeable change I'd been waiting for was the iOS search bar’s relocation to the bottom of the screen. I first noticed it within Settings, but it reappears in Music, Podcasts, Photos and pretty much everywhere you might need to find specific files or menu items now. If, like me, you’re an iPhone Pro or Plus user, you may have struggled to reach those search bars when they were at the top of the screen. It’s a welcome improvement.\n\nVisual Intelligence\nScreenshot (Apple)\nWith iOS 26  on iPhones powerful enough to run Apple Intelligence, the company is bringing Visual Intelligence over to your screenshots. (Previously it was limited to Camera.) Once you’ve grabbed a shot by pressing the power and volume up buttons, you’ll get a preview of your image, surrounded by suggested actions that Apple Intelligence deduced would be relevant based on the contents of your screenshot. \nManaging Editor Cherlynn Low did a deep dive on what Visual Intelligence is capable of. From a screenshot, you can transfer information to other apps without having to switch or select them manually. This means I can easily screenshot tickets and emails, for example, to add to my calendar. Apple Intelligence can also identify types of plants, food and cars, even. If there are multiple people or objects in your screenshot, you can highlight what you want to focus on by circling it. There aren’t many third-party app options at this point, but that’s often the case with a beta build. These are features that Android users have had courtesy of Gemini for a year or two, but at least now we get something similar on iPhones.\nOne quick tip: Make sure to tap the markup button (the little pencil tip icon) to see Visual Intelligence in your screenshots. I initially thought my beta build was missing the feature, but it was just hidden behind the markup menu.\nMore broadly, Apple Intelligence continues to work well, but doesn't stand out in any particular way. We’re still waiting for Siri to receive its promised upgrades. Still, iOS 26 appears to have improved the performance of many features that use the iPhone’s onboard machine learning models. Since the first developer build, voice memos and voice notes are not only much faster, but also more accurate, especially with accents that the system previously struggled with.\nApple Intelligence’s Writing tools — which I mainly use for summarizing meetings, conference calls and even lengthy PDFs — doesn't choke with more substantial reading. On iOS 18, it would struggle with voice notes longer than 10 minutes, trying to detangle or structure the contents of a meeting. I haven’t had that issue with iOS 26 so far.\n\nVan life vlogger, bald or running for Congress?Image by Mat Smith for Engadget\nGenmoji and Image Playground both offer up different results through the update. Image Playground can now generate pictures using ChatGPT. I’ll be honest, I hadn’t used the app since I tested it on iOS 18, but the upgrades mean it has more utility when I might want to generate AI artwork, which can occasionally reach photorealistic levels.\nOne useful addition is ChatGPT’s “any style” option, meaning you can try to specify the style you have in mind, which can skirt a little closer to contentious mimicry — especially if you want, say, a frivolous image of you splashing in a puddle, Studio Ghibli style.\nApple also tweaked Genmoji to add deeper customization options, but these AI-generated avatars don’t look like me? I liked the original Genmoji that launched last year, which had the almost-nostalgic style of 2010 emoji, but still somehow channeled the auras of me, my friends and family. This new batch are more detailed and elaborate, sure, but they don’t look right. Also, they make me look bald. And contrary to my detractors, I am not bald. Yet. This feels like a direct attack, Apple.\nYou might feel differently, however. For example, Cherlynn said that the first version of Genmoji did not resemble her, frequently presenting her as someone with much darker skin or of a different ethnicity, regardless of the source picture she submitted. \nStill, the ability to change a Genmoji’s expression, as well as add and remove glasses and facial hair through the new appearance customization options, is an improvement.\n\nA Camera app redesign for everyone\n\nApple has revisited the camera app, returning to basics by stripping away most of the previously offered modes and settings — at least initially — to display only video and photo modes.\nYou can swipe up from the bottom to see additional options, like flash, the timer, exposure, styles and more. You can also tap on the new six-dot icon in the upper right of the interface for the same options, though that requires a bit more of a reach. These behave in line with the new Liquid Glass design and you’ll see the Photo pill expand into the settings menu when you press either area. Long-pressing on icons lets you go deeper into shooting modes, adjusting frame rates and even recording resolutions.\nWhat I like here is that it benefits casual smartphone photographers while keeping all the settings that more advanced users demand. None of the updates here are earth-shattering, though. I hope Apple takes a good look at what Adobe’s Project Indigo camera app is doing — there are a lot of good ideas there.\nOne extra improvement if you use AirPods: Pressing and holding the stem of your AirPod (if it has an H2 chip) can now start video recording.\nApple Music tries to DJ\n\nAlongside the Liquid Glass design touches, the big addition to Apple Music this year is AutoMix. Like a (much) more advanced version of the crossfade feature found on most music streaming apps, in iOS 26, Music tries to mix between tracks, slowing or speeding up tempos, gently fading in drums or bass loops before the next song kicks in. Twenty percent of the time, it doesn’t work well — or Apple Music doesn’t even try. But the new ability to pin playlists and albums is useful, especially for recommendations from other folks that you never got around to listening to.\n\nMessages get a little more fun\nImage by Mat Smith for Engadget\nApple is making Messages more fun. One of the ways it’s doing so is by enabling custom backgrounds in chats, much like in WhatsApp. I immediately set out to find the most embarrassing photo of my colleague (and frenemy) Cherlynn Low and make it our chat background. I know she’s also running iOS 26 in beta, so she will see it. [Ed. note: Way to give me a reason to ignore your messages, Mat!]\nApple’s Live translation now works across Messages, voice calls and FaceTime. Setting things up can be a little complicated — you’ll first need to download various language files to use the feature. There’s also some inconsistency in the languages supported across the board. For instance, Mandarin and Japanese are supported in Messages, but not on FaceTime yet. In chats, if your system language is set to English or Spanish, then you’ll only be able to translate into English or Spanish. For those polyglots out there, if you want to translate incoming Japanese texts into German, you’ll need to set your device's language to German.\nWhile I didn’t get to flex my Japanese abilities on voice calls and FaceTime, iOS 26 was more than capable of keeping up with some rudimentary German and Spanish. I’m not sure if I’d rely on it for serious business translation or holiday bookings, but I think it could be a very useful tool for basics. \nThere’s also the ability to filter spam messages to their own little folder (purgatory). Spam texts remain a nightmare, so I appreciate any potential weapons in the fight. Sadly, it hasn’t quite manage to deal with the TikTok marketing agencies and phone network customer services that continue to barrage my Messages. Still, hopefully Apple will continue to improve its detection algorithms.\nOne more tool in the battle against spam: You can mute notifications for Messages from unknown numbers, although time-sensitive alerts from delivery services and rideshare apps will still reach you.\n\nNew apps are hit-or-miss\n\nNot everything in the beta lands, however. I’ve already touched on how Liquid Glass was initially a semi-transparent mess. The Games App, too, seems like an unnecessary addition. Because it’s a blend of the Games tab of the App Store and a silo of your preinstalled games, I’m not sure what it’s adding. It’s not any easier to navigate, nor does it introduce me to games I want to buy.\nCherlynn did want to highlight that for a casual gamer like herself, it’s intriguing to see if the Games app might start to recommend more mind-numbing puzzles or farming simulations. She was also intrigued by the idea of a more social gaming experience on iOS, issuing challenges to her friends. Still, because the phone she has been testing the beta on doesn’t have access to all her contacts or her gaming history, the recommendations and features are fairly limited at the moment.\nGames is one of two new apps that will automatically join your home screen. (Fortunately, they can be uninstalled). The other is Preview, which should be a familiar addition to any Mac user. It offers an easy way to view sent or downloaded files, like menus, ticket QR codes and more. During the developer beta, the app pulled in a handful of my documents that previously lived in the Files app. Navigation across both those apps is identical, although Preview is limited to files you can actually open, of course.\n\nAirPods, upgraded\n\nThis is more iPhone-adjacent, but iOS 26 includes several quality-of-life improvements for some of Apple’s headphones. First up: notifications when your AirPods are fully charged, finally! The Apple Watch got this kind of notification back in iOS 14, so it’s great to see Apple’s headphones catch up.\nApple is also promising “studio-quality sound recording” from the AirPods, augmenting recordings with computational audio improvements. There’s a noticable bump in audio quality. It appears that AirPods 4 and AirPods Pro 2 will record files at a sample rate of 48 kHz, which is double the rate used in the past. The sample rate bump happened last year, but it is dependent on what the app you're using. Is it “studio quality”? I don’t think so, but it’s an improvement. While recordings sound slightly better in quiet locations, the bigger change is in loud environments. The algorithm doesn't appear to be degrading audio quality as much while trying to reduce background noise.\niOS 26 also adds sleep detection to the buds. If the AirPods detect minimal movement, they’ll switch off automatically, which could be helpful for the next time I’m flying long-haul.\n\nWrap-up\n\nIn iOS 26, Apple has prioritized design changes and systemwide consistency over AI-centric software and features. While Liquid Glass is a big change to how your iPhone looks, Apple has drawn from user feedback to finesse the design into feeling less jarring and gelling better when the home screen, Control Center and Notification drop-downs overlap with each other.\nThere are numerous quality of life improvements, including Messages and Visual Intelligence, in particular. If anything, the AI elephant in the room is the lack of any substantial updates on Siri. After the company talked up advanced Siri interactions over a year ago, I’m still waiting for its assistant to catch up with the likes of Google.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/ios-26-beta-preview-liquid-glass-is-better-than-you-think-172155402.html?src=rss",
    "full_text": "However, it’s the smaller touches that make iOS 26 seem like a notable improvement over its predecessor. There is also a toggle within the Accessibility tab in Settings to reduce transparency further, but I hope Apple offers a slider so that users can choose exactly how “liquid” they want their “glass” to be. Once you’ve grabbed a shot by pressing the power and volume up buttons, you’ll get a preview of your image, surrounded by suggested actions that Apple Intelligence deduced would be relevant based on the contents of your screenshot. These are features that Android users have had courtesy of Gemini for a year or two, but at least now we get something similar on iPhones. Apple also tweaked Genmoji to add deeper customization options, but these AI-generated avatars don’t look like me? Long-pressing on icons lets you go deeper into shooting modes, adjusting frame rates and even recording resolutions.

It should make them virtually impervious to drifting and waning responsiveness, as iFixit explains here. You can even customize the hot-swappable face buttons to match your preferred platform, and to the delight of tournament players, you can play with a 1,000Hz polling rate for reduced input lag on PC (wired or wireless via a dongle). Both share Switch and Windows PC support, but 8BitDo gets a leg up with full Steam Deck compatibility. It also comes with a charging dock, which stores the 2.4GHz dongle when not in use. You can even save up to three control scheme profiles and cycle through them with a button located between the analog sticks.

The first public betas for iOS 26, iPadOS 26, macOS 26, watchOS 26 and tvOS 26 are now available, and we have directions on updating your devices if you're feeling brave.\nThe two most obvious changes serve to unify Apple's platforms. First, we have Apple's biggest cosmetic overhaul to date. Liquid Glass is the company's name for the shiny, translucent redesign that will be heading to its software this fall. The other significant change is in the numbering. Apple traded its old chronological system for a year-based one. Since 2026 is when the software will spend the bulk of its time in the spotlight, \"26\" it is.\nApple\niOS 26 brings new personalized backgrounds and polls to Messages. Live Translation is another new arrival, making it easier to communicate in Messages, FaceTime and Phone. In addition, Visual Intelligence inches forward: It now lets you interact with content on your iPhone's screen. There are also new screening tools to decide whether a conversation is worth your time. The Phone app even includes Hold Assist, which listens to the Muzak so you don't have to. Check out our preview of iOS 26 for more.\nArguably, Apple's most significant update this year is iPadOS 26. The new software makes Apple's tablet more of a workhorse. The iPad finally has desktop-like window management and Menu Bar dropdown entries. It even includes the Preview app and Exposé, both familiar to Mac users. The update should do a lot to calm the fury over the iPad Pro's wasted productivity potential. We got into the details of the iPadOS 26 public beta and found the new multitasking features to be a big deal.\nApple\nMeanwhile, Apple's Mac software adopts the \"26\" branding without ditching California landmarks. macOS Tahoe 26 adds the Phone app and Live Activities from the iPhone. The update also introduces a more advanced Spotlight that allows you to take actions directly from the launcher. Here's our first look at macOS Tahoe 26.\nFinally, watchOS 26 adds Workout Buddy, a virtual fitness coach. The AI-powered feature learns from your fitness history to \"identify meaningful insights in real time.\" A text-to-speech model then communicates those to you verbally. \"You're crushing it — closing that move ring for six straight days!\"\nAlthough the public betas are less risky than installing a developer beta on day one, remember that this is still pre-release software.

That’s not “an honest indicator of a relationship dynamic,” he argued. Garcia noted that AI companions can be good training wheels for certain folks, like neurodivergent people, who might have anxiety about going on dates and need to practice how to flirt or resolve conflict. But it’s no substitute for human touch, which Garcia says we are biologically programmed to need and want.

There’s a new design language called Liquid Glass, which means that you won’t be looking at a lot of items on your screen, but rather looking through them. Getting set up to run the beta is a straightforward process. First, make sure you’re on at least iOS / iPadOS 16.4 by going to Settings > General > About and checking your iOS version. You’ll need to be signed up for the Apple beta program. Next, you’ll need to start the update. In that case, you can skip the next two steps. Look for a new Beta Updates option and tap it."

The rumor that the affordable EV would just be a bare-bones Model Y has been circulating ever since Musk canceled a previous model that was to be built on an entirely new platform. The so-called “Model 2” was meant to be Musk’s long-promised “$25,o00 EV” that at one point was presented with having a Cybertruck-inspired design. He also suggested a lower-quality speaker array and cheaper exterior lighting that doesn’t use matrix headlights or light bars. This seems incredibly unlikely, as Tesla’s software is fairly central to the ownership experience. The Model Y currently sports eight cameras; if Tesla removes some of them, will FSD still work? The trade-offs could get pretty steep if Tesla starts down that road. Tesla’s cheapest EVs already utilize low-cost lithium-iron-phosphate (LFP) chemistries, nearly all of which are supplied by Chinese battery manufacturers. The company recently started production on its own LFP cells at its factory in Nevada, so it stands to reason that the new, cheaper Model Y is likely to use these batteries."

    "full_text": "I’ve been testing the developer beta on an M4 MacBook Air since WWDC in June, and after using it through to the latest dev beta release (which is similar to the public one), I’ve had some ups and downs. 1 / 15 Here are a bunch of ways you can customize the Liquid Glass look of macOS Tahoe, starting with light mode and the default icons. But Sequoia’s flatter, simpler design felt cleaner and more purposeful — and every time I see or use a Mac that’s not on the beta I want to go back. But even though Apple is improving Liquid Glass a little, it’s still making choices I find odd or out of place. In the past you could field an incoming call on your Mac, but now you get a full app that works just like it does on iOS, complete with the ability to listen to voicemail and dial numbers via your keyboard if you’re inclined (and actually have phone numbers memorized). But the new features in Tahoe are getting me to dabble. I imagine Apple may slowly flesh out these features over time, and that might be a healthy on-ramp for the power user-curious. However, Apple is likely to not be as freewheeling as an app like Raycast, since one person’s expansive clipboard history is another person’s privacy nightmare — likely the reason for the eight-hour time limit. I’ve noticed Signal and some Adobe apps acting up when displaying lots of white, temporarily looking like washed-out gray (though it’s not visible in saved files or screenshots, and some Lightroom Classic tools like cropping and the auto white balance eyedropper work fine but don’t always get picked up by your cursor).

But while there are aspects of the design that bother me, my biggest surprise about Liquid Glass has been the way I’ve just… gotten used to it. Which is a good thing, because Apple seems committed to hurtling us into this mixed-reality-ready aesthetic whether we wanted it or not. The outgoing design (left) in iOS 18 put navigational elements on a solid background. Liquid Glass (right) in iOS 26 opts for a water droplet look. Sure enough, the first beta was a little too glassy and sci-fi. I’m sure as hell not enabling the feature that turns all your homescreen icons into colorless blobs. You can turn down the Liquid Glass effect in accessibility settings by toggling on “reduce transparency.” The spatial effect you can add to lock screen photos is surprisingly convincing. This company will stick with a design vision, even when the complaints against it are loud and justified."

    "full_text": "But with a Magic Keyboard and an iPad running the iPadOS 26 beta, I can work like I would right on my MacBook or Surface Pro, using a bunch of windows plastered all over the place. (Sometimes they open in another space, but this feels like a bug.) Apps can be placed on top of one another or moved around the screen and dropped exactly where I want them. When you open an app, each launches into a full-sized window. There’s also a new Files app that makes it easier to access all the files saved on your iPad, or in iCloud, so you can quickly open documents you have saved on other computers. This all works so well that Apple has wiped out any remaining excuses for not bringing a touchscreen to the Mac. There are still reasons I turn to my MacBook Air, though. Take Google Docs for example: it’s bad on the iPad. But for folks who can mostly work in a bunch of windows? With iPadOS 26, I don’t need to carry my MacBook Air anymore."

    "full_text": "I’ve been using the developer beta and have some thoughts to share. David Clark, Apple’s senior director of software engineering for watchOS, told me it was a matter of highlighting the Apple Watch’s “core competencies”: fitness and staying connected. They all asked the same question: how much am I going to hate this Workout Buddy? Most fitness apps tend to motivate you with historical data as badges within the app. This little tweak helps me notice and use the Smart Stack a lot more. According to Clark, the improved Smart Stack algorithm now incorporates multiple signals from apps. Apparently, a giant flood warning was issued because of an impending torrential downpour. That led my spouse and me to swap our cars so their fancy sports car could sit in the garage. Wrist Flick has been super useful for me, a receiver of Too Many Notifications. But the combination of Double Tap and Wrist Flick has made me into a notification triage machine."

You can see the water droplet look of UI elements in iOS 26. The biggest thing you’ll notice about the software updates is that they have a new design language Apple is calling “Liquid Glass.” The design language is inspired by visionOS and, as the name implies, features a lot of transparency. I felt it was a wild change to my iPhone when I tried the first developer beta, and Apple has already tweaked some of the translucency and changed how Control Center looks in subsequent betas. The new operating systems also have an updated numbering scheme: they now all end with 26, taking cues from how the car industry names its cars after the following year. It’s a simpler and better system, if you ask me, and it should make it easier to know if you’re on the newest software."

Here’s everything you need to know about setting up the iOS 26 beta, along with the respective betas for iPadOS 26 and watchOS 26, which Apple also revealed in its WWDC 2025 keynote.\nBefore we get started:, no, you haven’t accidentally slept through eight versions of major Apple OS updates. In case you missed the news, from now on all of the company’s various operating systems will be named after years to keep everything aligned and easy to follow. So rather than iOS 19, we’re getting iOS 26 this year, which refers to the year after each update rolls out. Presumably that’s because we’ll be using it for longer in 2026 than what will remain of this year once the full version is in the wild.\nIt’s also important to keep in mind that any beta is software in a pre-release state, meaning it's far more likely you’ll encounter bugs, crashes and other issues with apps and in general use, which Apple and third-party developers will attempt to fix before the final version rolls out to users worldwide.\nInstall any beta at your own risk and think carefully before doing so with the device you use every day. It’s also very important that you back up any device you want to test software on before you download it.\niOS 26 supported devices\niOS 26 is supported on a wide range of iPhones — but not all of them. You’ll need one of the following models:\n\niPhone SE (second generation or later)\niPhone 11\niPhone 11 Pro\niPhone 11 Pro Max\niPhone 12\niPhone 12 mini\niPhone 12 Pro\niPhone 12 Pro Max\niPhone 13\niPhone 13 mini\niPhone 13 Pro\niPhone 13 Pro Max\niPhone 14\niPhone 14 Plus\niPhone 14 Pro\niPhone 14 Pro Max\niPhone 15\niPhone 15 Plus\niPhone 15 Pro\niPhone 15 Pro Max\niPhone 16e\niPhone 16\niPhone 16 Plus\niPhone 16 Pro\niPhone 16 Pro Max\n\nIf your iPhone isn’t listed above, that probably means it’s too old to run iOS 26, so you’ll need to upgrade to one of the listed models.\nHow to install the iOS 26 beta\nInstalling betas used to be a fiddly process, but it’s very easy these days. If it’s your first time installing an iOS public beta, you’ll need to first visit the Apple Beta Software Program website and sign up using your Apple credentials.\nAfter that, navigate to Settings > General > Software Update on your compatible iPhone, and choose “iOS 26 public beta”. You should then see the option to download and install the beta software.\nYou can read about our first experiences with iOS 26 here.\niPadOS 26 supported devices\nHere are the supported models for the iPadOS 26 beta\n\niPad Pro (M4)\niPad Pro 12.9-inch (3rd generation or later)\niPad Pro 11-inch (1st generation and later)\niPad Air (M3)\niPad Air (M2)\niPad Air (3rd generation and later)\niPad (A16)\niPad (8th generation and later)\niPad Mini (A17 Pro)\niPad Mini (5th generation and later)\n\nHow to install the iPadOS 26 public beta\nLike with iOS above, you’ll need to first visit the Apple Beta Software Program website and sign up using your Apple credentials if you’ve never taken part in one before.\nAfter that, navigate to Settings > General > Software Update on your supported iPad, and choose “iPadOS 26 public beta”. You should then see the option to download and install the beta software in the Software Update screen.\nYou can read about our experiences with iPadOS 26 here.\nwatchOS beta: Use caution\nWhile Apple Watch users can also participate in beta programs in the same way as iOS and iPadOS testers, doing so carries greater risk. That’s because if you’re not enjoying the experience and decide you want to downgrade to watchOS 11, well, you can’t. Apple doesn’t allow it. And if you downgrade your watch’s paired iPhone to iOS 18, your Apple Watch won’t work correctly with your phone until it’s back on the new software version. You can, however, leave your Apple Watch on watchOS 11 when your phone is on the iOS 26 beta.\nBe extremely sure, then, that you’re comfortable with the possibility of waiting it out for a few months with an Apple Watch plagued with issues before downloading the watchOS 26 beta. For most people, it likely isn’t worth the hassle.\nwatchOS 26 supported devices\nYou’ll need one of these models to run the watchOS 26 beta\n\nApple Watch SE.

Web Guide is a Search Labs experiment that leverages AI technology to organize the search results page by grouping pages related to specific aspects of the search query. Search Labs experiments are a way for Google to test out new ideas by letting users opt in to those they find interesting. The new Web Guide experiment is a variation on the fan-out technique for displaying search results that Google is already using with its AI Mode. The feature itself is powered by Gemini, which helps Google better understand the search query and then link to other pages that could have been missed if using a traditional Google Search. Google suggests the feature works well for open-ended search queries, like “how to solo travel in Japan” or even more complex, multi-sentence queries. For instance, you could ask something like “My family is spread across multiple time zones. What are the best tools for staying connected and maintaining close relationships despite the distance?” Each section of the search results will focus on one type of answer to the query. You can also turn off this Web View from this tab itself, if you want to see the standard results without having to disable the experiment entirely."

We also considered how many decibels the earplugs could reduce, or noise reduction ratings when they were available. A pack of disposable earplugs can seem like the obvious choice based on price, as most packs average around $10. When testing, we found that Mack’s Pillow Soft Silicone Putty Earplugs did a great job blocking snoring and other ambient noise. For the most effective results, ensure your earplugs fit properly -- an airtight seal will mean maximum noise reduction.

Today's complex economic picture presents a challenge for the Fed, which is tasked with maintaining maximum employment and containing inflation. While lower than markets expected, price growth is still well above the Fed's annual target rate of 2%. As a result, experts say the central bank has good reason to keep rate cuts on pause. \"Greater inflation would argue against cutting rates, absent any significant deterioration in labor conditions.\" But Kushi notes that \"any changes, delays or confirmations around tariffs could swing investor sentiment and move yields.\" If these trends eventually translate into higher unemployment, it would likely prompt the central bank to reduce borrowing costs. Here are some proven strategies that can help you save up to 1.5% on your mortgage rate. Your credit score will help determine whether you qualify for a mortgage and at what interest rate. If you can afford it, a down payment of at least 20% will also eliminate private mortgage insurance."

Whether by choice or necessity, millions of people are turning to freelancing as a long-term business strategy. Yet the self-employed span nearly every industry and skill level, from entry-level musicians to highly specialized brand consultants. But in today's competitive job market, setting up your own gig could be the easiest way to guarantee some income. When making the leap from a conventional employee to an independent contractor, don't wipe your slate clean. Setting up a separate legal structure will give you liability protection, tax flexibility and the ability to secure loans. Though Fiverr and Upwork can help you get started, many independent contractors don't recommend relying on them as the foundation of your business. Sites like these have \"pay to play\" elements or take a percentage of each transaction as commission. If you can't afford to hire someone, try different platforms or accounting software such as QuickBooks and HoneyBook."

The exposed database contained more than 22 million records storing the IP address and precise timestamp of when Leak Zone users logged in. While the records were not linked to individual users, the data could be used to identify users who logged into Leak Zone without using any anonymization tools. Leak Zone, which gained popularity in 2020, advertises access to a “vast collection of leaks ranging from breached databases to cracked accounts,” referring to stolen credentials used for logging into a person’s online accounts. A page on Leak Zone’s website claims the forum has more than 109,000 users. TechCrunch verified that the exposed database was recording users logging into Leak Zone by creating a new account and logging in to the site. It’s not known why the database was publicly exposed. Human error or misconfigurations are often a cause of data exposures, rather than malicious actions. The database is no longer online, UpGuard told TechCrunch."

But I'm going to focus on the baseline iPhone 17. There's been some back-and-forth on whether the iPhone 17 will have a scratch-resistant, antireflective display. So there may not be major discrepancies between the iPhone 16 and 17 on that front. Megapixels aren't the only determining factor for good-quality photos, but if it is an upgrade, that could make taking selfies or shooting videos for social media on the front-facing camera less of a compromise. One key element that could remain unchanged across both phones is the processor. In April, analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said the iPhone 17 Air and Pro models would sport 12GB of RAM but that Apple was still deciding whether to equip the baseline model with that higher amount too. In May, analyst Jeff Pu noted the baseline would remain at 8GB. That should help to stretch your battery life on either device. So any shiny new capabilities will likely land on its more premium phones first, such as the rumored antireflective display and redesigned cameras on the iPhone 17 Pro models."

You can start trying on clothing for yourself by tapping the \"try on\" icon on any product listing on Google or apparel product result you find on Google Images. \nPowering the experience is an image generation model Google trained to take into account how different materials fold, stretch and drape across different human bodies. According to Google, the model supports billions of clothing items found across the company's Shopping Graph, meaning their may be some outfits the AI will have a hard time parsing. However, most clothing items from popular retailers should be supported out of the gate.   \nWith today's release, Google has also enhanced the price-tracking functionality built into the feature. Naturally, you can specify the color and size you want, but Google also allows you to set the price you want to pay for the item. It's possible to configure the watch so you're only alerted after the product you want dips below a specific price. \"The Shopping Graph has products and prices from all across the web — so we’ll let you know when there’s an offer that meets your criteria,\" says Google. \"No more constantly checking to see if that bag you’re eyeing is finally at the right price for you or forgetting to come back to a product you loved.\"\nLater this year, Google plans to bring additional shopping features to AI Mode, the dedicated AI tab the company began rolling out to everyone in the US this past May.

Powering the experience is an image generation model Google trained to take into account how different materials fold, stretch and drape across different human bodies. According to Google, the model supports billions of clothing items found across the company's Shopping Graph, meaning their may be some outfits the AI will have a hard time parsing. However, most clothing items from popular retailers should be supported out of the gate. It's possible to configure the watch so you're only alerted after the product you want dips below a specific price. \"The Shopping Graph has products and prices from all across the web — so we’ll let you know when there’s an offer that meets your criteria,\" says Google. \"No more constantly checking to see if that bag you’re eyeing is finally at the right price for you or forgetting to come back to a product you loved.\" Later this year, Google plans to bring additional shopping features to AI Mode, the dedicated AI tab the company began rolling out to everyone in the US this past May. Come this fall, you'll be able to explore outfit and decor ideas — and buy what suits your fancy — directly from the chat bot."

    "summary": "The best Nintendo games do two things. The first is introducing a delightful gaming mechanic — take Ultrahand in The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom or Cappy in Super Mario Odyssey for some recent examples. The second is building a world around that mechanic for players to explore. Obviously games are more than one specific tool, and building a compelling game around a good mechanic is no small task. But when it all comes together, look out. You’ve got a game that people will remember for years, if not decades.\nIt’s a little early in the Switch 2’s lifecycle to say definitively that Donkey Kong Bananza is a game of that caliber, but after playing it for the better part of a week I can say that the “smash everything” mechanic that defines its gameplay is an absolute delight. And, just as importantly, Nintendo built a wonderful world around it, completely with varied levels and obstacles, charming characters, bizarre and delightful enemies, some catchy tunes and just enough challenge to keep it interesting. 3D platformers aren’t even my favorite game style — I prefer Super Mario Wonder over Odyssey, and I love the various Donkey Kong platformers going back to the SNES days. But Bananza makes consistently good use of every dimension you can play in, and it’s the kind of game that I’m going to keep exploring long after I roll credits.\n\nTo back up quickly: Bonanza introduces us to Donkey Kong and his smashing skills in a somewhat lengthy tutorial where you bust through a mine looking for gold. This sequence involves mashing the Y button to bust up the rocks around you and collect all the treasures that are revealed. DK can jump, climb many surfaces, rip up pieces of the terrain to throw and pound the ground to quickly collect treasure, but the main thing you’re doing here is smashing. Smashing as much as possible. You can smash above you, below you and in front of you, and you can smash almost any surface you encounter (the game helpfully makes it obvious when a surface is impervious to DK fists.)\nAt first, I thought I was going to get tired of all the smashing — the tutorial made it feel like mindlessly mashing Y was going to be all I was going to do in the game. But then the expected villain appears, stealing the Banandium gems (just go with it) and DK is compelled to dive deeper and deeper into the crust of the planet to get his bananas back. Once that happens, the game truly reveals itself: each “world” you need to clear is a layer of the planet, but this being a Nintendo game none of the rules apply. Lagoon Layer is up first, and there’s clear blue skies, water everywhere and varied terrain to explore (and smash). Residents of each layer will direct you to help clean up the trouble wrought by the three Kong creatures who make up VoidCo, the dastardly antagonists who stole the bananas.\nNintendo\nBananza is good about guiding you from goal to goal while also giving you tons of freedom to explore and navigate the layers in any way you see fit. My guess is that the first thing you’ll do is smash everything in sight. The smash mechanic on its own in the tutorial level didn’t feel all that exciting, but putting it into the context of beautifully crafted 3D worlds to explore makes it an absolute delight. You can basically go anywhere you can see, and you can smash nearly anything the game puts in front of you.\nIt’s hard to pinpoint exactly what makes smashing so satisfying, besides the obvious and undeniable fact that destruction is fun. But the combination of visual, haptic and audio cues combine to make it something that absolutely does not get old despite my initial reservations. The crunch of smashing through rocks and mountains just feels different than when you’re pounding your way through dirt or splintering giant trees. And smashing also equals exploration — if you see a mountain you can just pound your way into it to find gold, fossils (that you can exchange for upgraded costumes), power-ups and, most crucially, Banandium gems.\nNintendo\nThe Banandium gems are similar to the stars or moons or whatever else other 3D platformers have you collect as you explore. Some you’ll get naturally as you progress through the game and defeat various bosses, but there are dozens hidden around each layer that you’ll want to seek out, as getting five gives you an upgrade point. Those you can use to add more health, and upgrade DK’s various skills (like being able to smash through tougher terrain). There are also little hidden challenge levels that throw some tough platforming or timed battles at you with multiple bananas as a reward. There are a ton of ways to find bananas, and tons of them scattered around the various levels. I’m not exactly rushing through the game (there’s so much to smash, you see), and I don’t think I’ve found more than half of the bananas in any of Bananza’s layers.\nNintendo\nDonkey Kong Bananza is more than just smashing, though! I’d be remiss if I didn’t mention the game’s secondary protagonist, Pauline. It’s reasonable if you don’t know her by name; she’s the damsel in distress in the old ‘80s Donkey Kong games but more recently showed up in Super Mario Odyssey as the mayor of New Donk City who loves to belt out a tune. In Bananza, Pauline is a 13-year-old who was captured by the VoidCo crew but is rescued by DK early in the game. From there, she sits on your shoulder as you work together to achieve your ends: Pauline needs to get to the planet’s core to eventually get back to the surface and DK needs to get the VoidCo Kongs to get his Banandium gems back.\nPauline’s love of singing becomes a crucial part of the game, as her voice guides to checkpoints, unlocks hidden areas and, most importantly, activates various special powers that DK gains throughout the game. Multiple layers have delightfully ridiculous Elder animals presiding over them, including a giant ape, ostrich and zebra. Most of them have peacefully retired in their layers and have taken up DJing as a hobby; if you repair whatever damage VoidCo has caused, they’ll grant you a new Bananza power. The Kong power supercharges DK’s punches, while the Ostrich power lets you temporarily fly and float. Naturally, these powers end up being crucial to advancing in the game.\nNintendo\nThey’re all activated by different songs that Pauline learns, and those cut scenes are some of my favorite parts of the game. As a 13-year-old, she’s not exactly comfortable singing in front of the big crowds gathered by the Elders, but she gets over it, performs with gusto and starts a wild dance party. As with most Nintendo games in this style, Pauline doesn’t get a ton of character development — but watching her bond with DK and become more confident throughout her side chatter during the game is extremely sweet. One of my favorite moments in the game happens when DK takes a nap at the various hideouts you find to recover your energy. As the screen darkens for your nap, Pauline starts chattering about the world you’re in or the adventures you’ve had, and it all feels like a kid trying to talk to their parents to avoid falling asleep. She gets drowsy, starts making a little less sense and eventually nods off. It’s an unexpected and totally unnecessary (and optional) part of the game, but it really gives Pauline a personality.\nI’m in the last stages of the game, and at this point I’m playing as much to see what happens with Pauline and DK as I am to keep smashing more things. That somewhat unexpected combo of heart and destruction has kept me engrossed in Donkey Kong Bananza for the last week, and there’s a ton of replayability that’ll likely have me starting a new run once I finish this one. There’s so much to explore, so many Banandium gems to find, so much to smash. It might not be the system-seller that something like Mario Kart World is, but it’s the first truly great game for the Switch 2.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/donkey-kong-bananza-review-nintendos-latest-3d-platformer-is-an-instant-classic-143048108.html?src=rss",

Well, we have good(ish) news. Amazon has now added a slightly cheaper Colorsoft to its lineup. At $250, it’s still very expensive, but $30 cheaper than the original model, albeit with some sacrifices made.\nAt 16GB, the cheaper Kindle Colorsoft has half the storage of the more expensive variant, but given that most ebooks rarely ask for more than around 2MB of space in your library, this might be good enough. If you own a lot of digital graphic novels and comics (ie the kind of media that really makes good use of color display), you can expect those to hog more storage, but you’d still need a very large library to start pushing towards that 16GB limit. \n \nThe cheaper model also loses the auto-adjusting front light and wireless charging from the Signature Edition, but beyond that, it’s the same ereader. Like its pricier counterpart, the new Kindle Colorsoft has a 7-inch color E Ink display with up to eight weeks of battery life, a handy pinch-to-zoom feature and an adjustable warm light. Amazon has also fixed the yellow-band issue that plagued some early units, including our first review unit.\nAmazon is also offering theKindle Colorsoft Kids, which comes with an illustrated cover, one year of Amazon Kids+ and a two-year guarantee. It also has child-specific features such as Vocabulary Builder and Word Wise to help kids learn new words as they read, as well as support for the OpenDyslexic font and Bluetooth for audiobooks. There are two covers available — Fantasy River and Starlight Reading — and parents can use the Amazon Parent Dashboard to manage and monitor what their child is reading.\nThe Kindle Colorsoft with 16GB of storage costs $250 and comes with three months of Kindle Unlimited included, and the Kindle Colorsoft Kids costs $270.

Do you have an insane neighbor who will set your yard on fire if a robot dares tread upon his property?

Most robot mowers handle obstacles using vision sensors, and those that don't are not my favorites. The mowers will need their blades replaced periodically as they wear down, but that's not too difficult to do. If possible, you may also want to remove the battery and store it inside your home at room temperature. If you have any narrow paths of grass in your lawn, the robot won't handle those well. Overall, the main thing I learned from my experience is that robot lawn mowers are ultimately worth it despite their foibles, an opinion I share with other CNET reviewers who’ve taken them for a spin. They eliminate a task that many homeowners don't like in the first place. Once you power through those initial steps, the mower takes care of itself."

I evaluated the SoundLink Plus for a few hours on its own, and it performed well with the majority of test tracks I threw at it, though it really shined with well-recorded material and didn't seem as constrained at higher volumes as some mini Bluetooth speakers I've tested. All those speakers except the Sony ULT 5 list for a little less than this Bose (however, the ULT 5 does seem to regularly go on sale for $250). Comparing the SoundLink Plus to other top Bluetooth speakers from JBL, Sony and LG. You can find better value Bluetooth speakers -- I still like Anker's Soundcore Boom 2, which costs around $120 or slightly less during flash sales -- but the Bose has a little richer, more refined sound with better clarity and a slicker design. The SoundLink Max also plays bigger than its size would indicate and competes well against significantly larger Bluetooth boombox-style speakers. On the other hand, both those models have a few strikes against them. It may not be the perfect Bluetooth speaker for everybody, but it should hit the sweet spot for a lot of folks, especially when its price dips a bit during flash sales."

On the grid, there are spots to unlock more points as well as more ways to get the points from deflecting attacks, doing a certain combo or having a certain amount of madness. You need to really get in there and mix it up with the enemies, which I can appreciate. It happened after a certain amount of playing and not due to too much going on-screen."

It \"had to act urgently to protect the platform’s core payment infrastructure,\" it said, because the \"situation developed rapidly.\" \nThe website explained that it recently came under the scrutiny of its payment processors after an organization called Collective Shout launched a campaign against Steam and itch.io. Collective Shout, which describes itself as an Australian grassroots campaigning movement, directed its concerns to the gaming marketplaces' payment processors. It originally focused its campaign around the game No Mercy that revolves around a character engaging in rape and sexual violence. Both itch.io and Steam removed the game back in April. In its open letter to payment processors published earlier this month, however, the group said it \"discovered hundreds of other games featuring rape, incest and child sexual abuse\" on Steam and itch.io since then. \nSteam already banned \"content that may violate the rules and standards set forth\" by its payment processors, which mostly affected adult games. Now, itch.io is also clearly heading that way. At the moment, the website is doing a comprehensive audit of its content and will keep adult games delisted until it's done. After it's finished, it will introduce new compliance measures and will require creators of adult games to confirm that their titles are allowed under the rules of the payment processors linked to their account.\nItch.io admitted that some games will be permanently removed from its marketplace as part of its review and the new policy it will put in place, but it said its \"ability to process payments is critical for every creator\" on its platform. \"To ensure that we can continue to operate and provide a marketplace for all developers, we must prioritize our relationship with our payment partners and take immediate steps towards compliance,\" the website said in its announcement. \nAlthough No Mercy's removal from gaming websites is understandably celebrated by a lot of people, users are concerned about the potential effects of marketplaces adopting anti-porn rules.

    "full_text": "We've seen it dip to $225 during Prime Day sales events, but Amazon has now released a new lower-priced $250 Colorsoft model with less storage as well as the \"first-ever Kindle in color for kids.\" The two new models are in fact the same device but the Kindle Colorsoft Kids ($270) includes one year of Amazon Kids+, a two-year \"worry-free\" guarantee (Amazon will replace it if it's damaged, no questions asked) and a \"kid-friendly\" cover. The new models have the same adjustable warm light as the Signature Edition but you have to adjust it manually (it doesn't auto adjust based on your environmental lighting conditions). However, I did say that the \"new, improved Kindle Paperwhite or entry-level Kindle are better options for most folks\" due to the Colorsoft's high price. Not long after it launched, Amazon had to pause shipments of the Colorsoft after some early users reported having an issue with yellow tinging at the bottom of the Colorsoft's display. When it resumed shipping the device, Amazon noted on the Colorsoft's product page that a small number of customers had reported a yellow band along the bottom of the display and asked any customers who noticed this to reach out to Amazon's customer service team for a replacement or refund. Amazon said that it had had made \"the appropriate adjustments to ensure that new devices will not experience this issue moving forward.\" However, several users posted negative reviews of the Colorsoft, making it Amazon's worst-rated Kindle e-reader (by its users). The color resolution is only 150 pixels per inch for color, while it's 300 ppi for black and white. Some people will appreciate that you can also highlight text in different colors like you would with real-world highlighter pens."

AI Mode, a new vertical in Google Search that's broadly rolling out in the US and India, is getting a new generative imaging feature. Google's integration of more AI-powered features across its product portfolio is now coming for its core money maker: online search.

    "full_text": "Each week, Netflix releases a list of the Top 10 films and TV shows dominating the platform, and for the week of July 14, we noticed that not one, but two seasons of a TV show called Sullivan's Crossing are sitting among the most-watched titles. They both co-starred in Gilmore Girls, although Murray's stint was just for a few episodes early in the series before he got his real break on One Tree Hill. Still, it seemed weird that these two actors -- who are instantly recognizable to me -- are in a show that people seem to be devouring on the platform, but that I've literally never heard of. Sullivan's Crossing, which debuted in 2023, originally aired on CTV in Canada, so it wasn't even available to US audiences until it made its way to the CW last year. So far, three seasons of the show have aired on both CTV and the CW, though only seasons 1 and 2 are available on Netflix. (A fourth season has also been greenlit.) The first thing to know is that it's based on the novels by author Robyn Carr, who also gave us another Netflix phenomenon, Virgin River, which I have seen (I'm still shocked by the fact that it's Netflix's longest-running scripted drama). Sullivan's Crossing follows neurosurgeon Maggie Sullivan (played by Morgan Kohan) as she relocates from Boston back to her hometown in Nova Scotia to escape legal trouble and reconnect with her father, Sully (Patterson), a recovering alcoholic. Netflix seems to have cornered the market on these cozy romantic dramas with small-town vibes and non-threatening complications: Sullivan's Crossing seems to be filling a void left by Virgin River and Sweet Magnolias, which are both between seasons at the moment and are similarly in that \"Hallmark Channel but make it a little more PG-13\" category. And you'll want to start binge-watching so you're all caught up before season 3 arrives -- Netflix has just confirmed that 10 more episodes are dropping on Aug. 11."

Your friend will receive an automatic alert in your chat conversation once you arrive home. Snapchat notes that alerts can only be sent to friends you already share your location with. Plus, since location sharing on Snap Map is off by default, no one can see your location or receive a Home Safe alert unless you choose to share it. “Whether you’re heading back from a first date, a crowded concert, or a weekend getaway, Home Safe can offer a close friend or family member peace of mind that you’ve made it home safely,” Snapchat wrote in a blog post. This new feature comes two months after Snapchat announced that Snap Map now has more than 400 million monthly active users. Snap Map, which launched in 2017, was originally a way for users to see their friends’ locations and browse public snaps from around the world. Over time, the feature has evolved and now offers ways for users to discover local hotspots and find things to do."

It folds up easily, so it works if you have limited space in your home. I’ve been using this stroller for part of the summer and love how it’s made it easier for me to go out for a run while also bringing my toddler along with me. The Guava is sturdy and can hold a 6-month-old infant up to a 60-pound child. It has airless rubber bike tires that always run smoothly and can handle all terrains. I’ve pushed it through pavement, grass, even trails with rocky areas. You can adjust the handles based on your preferred height, which is a plus if caretakers of different heights will be using it. My alternative stroller is the UPPAbaby Vista V3, and it’s noticeable how much smoother the Guava is in comparison, even when I load up the stroller with my toddler’s diaper bag and other accessories. Storing it is even easier; all you have to do is lock the stroller, adjust the handle to the lowest setting and pull the handle under the seat to fold it in half."

You can activate a pair of massive shoulder-mounted soundwave turrets that are powerful enough to tear smaller zombies asunder, while staggering larger enemies such as Scrakes and Fleshpounds. The Engineer gets additional bullet penetration with all of his weapons, which means each shot will pierce multiple zombies and shred them extremely quickly. This class has very little defense against melee attackers, but dominates zombies that fight at longer range. This heatseeking tool zips through close to a dozen zombies before embedding in the final foe for an explosive finish. Other purchasable primaries include throwing kunai, a compound bow and dual katanas -- this arsenal gives you options when it comes to dealing with armored, bladed enemies that might otherwise best you in melee combat. Crucially, the Medic's weapons have a built-in syringe dart underbarrel attachment that'll let you fire healing shots at your teammates from afar. Meanwhile, any zombies that encroach on your territory will take damage over time while the effect is active. If you want to be a good team player and have the best chance of going the distance on harder difficulty survival runs, you'll definitely want to invest in Killing Floor 3's Medic perk."

    "full_text": "I found myself frantically zipping around the map as I was overwhelmed by armies of the dead, utilizing ziplines and side-dashes to escape their clutches -- a fun flow reflecting a refined balance of danger and death-dealing. Slicing and dicing zombies is more disgusting than ever with Killing Floor 3's new gore physics. Killing Floor 3 takes the gore system a step further by letting you eviscerate still (un)living zombies. Ballistic gunplay feels sickeningly kinetic and impactful, but this advanced viscera system extends to other damage types too. There may not be as much gratuitous blood and guts in Killing Floor 3 as there were in its predecessors, but this new system feels more rewarding -- and has a true impact on your moment-to-moment gameplay. Nowhere is this more apparent than with Killing Floor 3's lack of in-game healing. Weapon loadouts make you stronger at the beginning of a Killing Floor 3 match -- but should they? Killing Floor 3's changes to the perk and character system feel like a proto-hero shooter, which isn't what people play this series for. There are fewer than 30 guns, launchers and blades in the game at launch compared with Killing Floor 2's arsenal of nearly 90 weapons (though in Tripwire Interactive's defense, Killing Floor 3 is a seasonal live service game, and more weapons are on the roadmap for the four postlaunch seasons that have already been planned out). It's going to be tough for Tripwire Interactive to compete against its own game with nearly 10 years of free updates, especially since Killing Floor 3 is priced at $40 compared with Killing Floor 2's $30 price tag."

    "summary": "Update (7/24/25): Only a couple of days after the new Switch 2 Pokémon Legends: Z-A bundle was announced, you can now pre-order it at various retailers or pick up an existing Switch 2 bundle that's back in stock. The Pokémon bundle, which will be widely available in October, is available for pre-order from Walmart, Target and Best Buy. The Switch 2 Mario Kart World bundle is back in stock at Walmart and Best Buy at the moment as well.\n\nThe Nintendo Switch 2 is finally available in the US, but it's still pretty tough to find it in stock online anywhere. The $450 console officially went up for sale on June 5, and several retailers have offered it both online and in-store in the week since. While millions of people have been able to buy theirs so far, online inventory has dried up considerably since launch day. There have been restocks at Walmart, Target and Best Buy, but they didn't last long, which was to be expected. You may also be able to grab a bundle at Costco if you’re a member there, but you might have a better time doing so in store than online. \nAnd that may be the way to go at this point, broadly speaking. You may have better luck venturing into a physical store and walking out with a Switch 2 than you will buying one online. If you have a local Target, Best Buy, Walmart or GameStop — the four official retailers Nintendo lists on its store page — it can't hurt to stop by and see if they have any in stock. A few retailers, GameStop being one of them, are even directing online customers to \"find a store\" near them that has the console in stock. If you're still on the hunt, we’ve rounded up all of the latest information we could find on how to buy the Nintendo Switch 2 and where you can pick one up.\nWhere to buy the Nintendo Switch 2\nWalmart has restocked the Switch 2 a few times since launch, but most of the time, the new stock has been exclusively available to Walmart+ members, or they've gotten first pick before the wider public. Walmart works with third-party sellers across its site, and outside of official restocks, we've seen the Switch 2 become available at much higher prices than normal. We do not recommend buying the Switch 2 at a premium like this, but rather it's better to wait for an official restock. Naturally, the world's largest retailer is also selling the console at its brick-and-mortar locations, though the company has noted that quantities are limited and inventory will vary by location.\nAmazon finally has the Switch 2 listed now: the Switch 2 console is up for $450 while the Mario Kart World bundle costs $500. This comes after weeks of the console being conspicuously absent from the retail giant's site. A June 30 Bloomberg report confirmed what had been widely rumored for weeks: Nintendo was apparently punishing Amazon for continuing to surface third-party retailers selling trans-shipped games. That punishment appears to be over now, but note that both the console by itself and the bundle are available \"by invitation\" only from Amazon, which just means you have to register your interest with Amazon before you get an official invite that will allow you to buy the Switch 2.\nBest Buy has restocked a few times since launch as well, and similarly to Walmart, we recommend waiting for official restocks to buy in the future. Best Buy stores may also have limited quantities available to buy in person.\nTarget is much the same deal as Walmart and Best Buy, although it has been less forthcoming about announcing future restocks than the other two retailers. You may have some luck going to a local Target store near you and checking to see if they have consoles to buy in store.\nGameStop has advertised in-store availability, though exactly how much stock your local store may have will vary by location. Online, the device has been unavailable for the past week, with the listings for the base console and Mario Kart bundle now pointing to a \"Find a Store\" page. \nYou may still have some luck at certain membership-based retailers. A Mario Kart World bundle at Costco that includes a 12-month Switch Online subscription has gone in and out of stock since launch day. Sam's Club has had a bundle without the Switch Online sub as well, though it's out of stock now. We also saw the console at BJ's early on June 5, but it's showing up as out of stock now.\nVerizon briefly had the Switch 2 available on launch day, but that's dried up. Only those with Verizon service were able to order, and the process was apparently somewhat rocky. \nNewegg has listed the Switch 2 on its site for several weeks, but it's given no indication as to when it'll begin sales. While some listings are available via a third-party seller, they're at massively inflated prices.\nWith all of these stores, we've seen the Mario Kart World bundle available in greater quantities online than the base console, which costs $50 less. But given that Mario Kart is the Switch 2's biggest launch game and retails for $80 on its own, that may not be the worst thing.\nNintendo, meanwhile, is only offering the Switch 2 via an invite system. This requires you to have been a Switch Online member for at least 12 months and logged at least 50 hours of Switch 1 playtime as of April 2. It can't hurt to sign up if you meet the criteria, but don't expect it to bear fruit immediately — it's taken weeks for many people who registered in April to receive their invite.\nYou can find a list of every Switch 2 retail listing we could find below. Just be aware that this is meant to be a reference, not a rundown of everywhere the device is available right this second.\nWhere to buy Switch 2 + Mario Kart World bundle:\n\nWalmart\nGameStop\nBest Buy\nTarget\nCostco (membership required)\nSam's Club (membership required)\nVerizon (service required)\n\nWhere to buy Switch 2 + Pokémon Legends: Z-A bundle (pre-order now, available October 16):\n\nWalmart\nBest Buy\nTarget\n\nWhere to buy Switch 2:\n\nWalmart\nGameStop\nBest Buy\nTarget\nBJ's (membership required)\nVerizon (service required)\n\nWhere to buy Nintendo Switch 2 games and accessories\nNintendo is selling a number of Switch 2 accessories alongside the console, from its (pricey) Pro Controller to cases to cameras for the new GameChat feature. Most of these became available on June 5. The same goes for games like Mario Kart World and the Switch 2 version of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. Another big Switch 2 release, Donkey Kong Bananza, will be available shortly starting on July 17 but is still up for pre-order now.\nAs of this publication, just about all Switch 2 games are broadly available. Stock for the accessories remains a little spottier, but most devices are still available at multiple retailers. Nintendo's official Switch 2 carrying cases have been the main exceptions, so you may need to look to third-party alternatives if you want some protection for your console right away.\nMario Kart World ($80)\n\nNintendo\nWalmart\nGameStop\nBest Buy\nTarget\n\nDonkey Kong Bananza ($70)\n\nNintendo\nAmazon\nWalmart\nGameStop\nBest Buy\nTarget\nCostco (membership required)\n\nAdditional Switch 2 games\n\nNintendo\nAmazon\nWalmart\nGameStop\nBest Buy\nTarget\n\nSamsung microSD Express Card (256GB) for Nintendo Switch 2 ($60)\n\nNintendo\nWalmart\nGameStop\nBest Buy\nTarget\nAmazon\n\nJoy-Con 2 bundle ($95)\n\nNintendo\nWalmart\nGameStop\nBest Buy\nTarget\n\nSwitch 2 Pro Controller ($85)\n\nNintendo (invite required)\nWalmart\nGameStop\nBest Buy\nTarget\nCostco ($75, membership required)\n\nSwitch 2 Camera ($55)\n\nNintendo\nWalmart\nGameStop\nBest Buy\nTarget\n\nHori Nintendo Switch 2 Piranha Plant Camera ($60)\n\nBest Buy\nTarget\nAmazon\n\nJoy-Con 2 Charging Grip ($40)\n\nNintendo\nWalmart\nGameStop\nBest Buy\nTarget\n\nJoy-Con 2 Wheels (set of 2) ($25)\n\nNintendo\nWalmart\nGameStop\nBest Buy\nTarget\n\nSwitch 2 All-in-One Carrying Case ($85)\n\nNintendo\nWalmart\nGameStop\nBest Buy\nTarget\n\nSwitch 2 Carrying Case and Screen Protector ($40)\n\nNintendo (invite required)\nWalmart\nGameStop\nBest Buy\nTarget\n\nNintendo Switch 2 Dock Set ($120)\n\nNintendo\n\nNintendo GameCube Controller for Switch 2 ($65)\n\nNintendo (Switch Online required)\n\n This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/how-to-buy-the-switch-2-nintendos-restock-updates-at-walmart-best-buy-target-and-others-120039239.html?src=rss",

The 2015 film from writer-director George Miller is set in a post-apocalyptic desert and is essentially a non-stop battle sequence where hero Max Rockatansky (Tom Hardy) teams up with Theron's Imperator Furiosa to wage battle against warlord Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne) and his army. After reconnecting, the two friends explore their friendship and wonder what might have been had Nora never left. Grug doesn't always welcome learning new things from a human and Eep's curious, sometimes rebellious ways also contribute to family disagreements. 20th Century Pictures Heat (1995) Michael Mann's 1995 movie Heat is most famous for being the first film in which acting titans Al Pacino and Robert De Niro appeared on screen in a scene together but it also features a fantastic performance from the late, great Val Kilmer. Taylour Paige, Colman Domingo and Glynn Turman all co-star in the film that was adapted from August Wilson's 1982 play. Rustin's outspoken activism and homosexuality made him a target -- not just for political adversaries but sometimes even among his allies. Rating: PG-13 Godzilla Minus One is an Academy Award-winning Japanese-language movie written and directed by Takashi Yamazaki. After surviving an encounter with Godzilla, he and others realize the kaiju is gearing up to attack Tokyo.

    "full_text": "How soon will it be before Netflix subscribers begin to see movies and TV shows that were made with generative AI technology? In a video conference call after Netflix's earnings were announced on July 17, Sarandos took questions, one of which was focused on when and how the streaming company will generate content with artificial intelligence tools. For a scene showing a building collapsing in Buenos Aires, Netflix's tech team worked with the filmmakers to generate AI footage that was used as final footage. \"We remain convinced that AI represents an incredible opportunity to help creators make films and series better, not just cheaper,\" Sarandos said in the call. \"They were able to achieve an amazing result with remarkable speed,\" Sarandos said. El Eternauta has already been renewed for a second season and received positive reviews. \"Netflix using AI for final footage in El Eternauta isn't entirely surprising given their track record of embracing new technologies early -- from streaming to algorithm-driven recommendations to interactive content,\" Kate O'Neill, founder of KO Insights and author of What Matters Next, told CNET. \"What's notable is how matter-of-factly CEO Ted Sarandos revealed this, suggesting they view it as a natural evolution rather than a watershed moment,\" O'Neill says. Some of those ethical and legal questions include what data AI models are being trained on and if intellectual property is being infringed upon, not to mention the effect widespread AI may have on an industry of actors, craftspeople and digital-effects workers. \"While AI can democratize access to sophisticated visual effects, we need transparency about how these tools are trained and whether they're incorporating existing copyrighted material,\" O'Neill says."

I find it more comfortable than most Xbox and other popular controllers. These are becoming more popular but it's still rare to find them on controllers priced far below $100. On the back, there are two programmable buttons that you can remap to almost any keypress. If you're switching Bluetooth inputs, just be prepared that it might take a couple of minutes before everything's ready to go. You'll quickly get spoiled by not having to manually turn on your console like a Neanderthal. Aside from the magnetic faceplates, there are plenty of other customization options available in GameSir Connect app for Windows. There are also iOS and Android apps, but they don't offer quite as much customization. I do wish you could store multiple profiles on the controller, and some people might be turned off by the lack of Xbox support, but none of those are deal-breakers for me. If you want to upgrade your Switch controller with one that also works great for PC and mobile, or if you want a great, inexpensive extra controller for your partner or kiddos, you really can't go wrong with the Super Nova."

No gaming keyboard would be complete without RGB lighting, and that's one place the MX 8.2 shines (pun intended). You can customize the backlight for every key and there are several different lighting effects to choose from. The MX 8.2 is built for gamers and as such, has a few gaming-focused features that are helpful. It also supports full n-key rollover, which means every keypress is registered even when pressing multiple keys at once. That being said, Cherry offers superb craftsmanship and a wonderful typing experience with the MX 8.2. The compact layout means it doesn't take up a lot of room on your desk while the per-key RGB lighting offers a lot of customization, as long as you're prepared for an annoying software experience. If you need a dedicated gaming keyboard that goes all-in on features and performance, there are better options."

    "summary": "If you're lucky enough to have a new Nintendo Switch 2 in hand right now, you're probably filling it up with old and new games alike. The console comes with 256GB of storage built in; that's eight times more than the original Switch and four times more than the Switch OLED. But the new console’s improved performance means that some games will hog a ton of that space. Take, for instance, Cyberpunk 2077, which is a 59GB download, while Split Fiction checks in at 69GB. While not all titles hog so much storage, there's a good chance you'll want to add more space to your Switch 2 as time goes on.\nYou'll need a microSD Express card to do that. These are not the same as the standard microSD cards you may have for the first Switch or other gaming handhelds. They're newer, faster and (as to be expected) more expensive. But if you want more space, they’re your only choice. If you’re looking to grab one today, we’ve laid out the best microSD cards for the Switch 2 and broken down what you should know before you buy.\nThe best microSD cards for the Switch 2 (and why you might want to wait to buy)\nThe SanDisk microSD Express Card and Lexar Play Pro.Jeff Dunn for Engadget\nThe Switch 2 is the first mainstream device to require microSD Express for storage expansion, so there aren’t many options available to buy just yet. To make things easy, here’s a list of every microSD Express card we’ve seen at retailers at the time of writing.\n128GB\n\nSanDisk microSD Express Card ($54 MSRP)\nPNY microSD Express Card ($45 MSRP)\n\n256GB\n\nSamsung microSD Express Card for Nintendo Switch 2 ($60 MSRP)\nSanDisk microSD Express Card ($73 MSRP)\nLexar Play Pro ($50 MSRP)\nPNY microSD Express Card ($59 MSRP)\nGameStop Express microSD Card for Nintendo Switch 2 ($60 MSRP)\nOnn microSD Express Card ($36 MSRP)\n\n512GB\n\nLexar Play Pro ($100 MSRP)\nGameStop Express microSD Card for Nintendo Switch 2 ($100 MSRP)\nOnn microSD Express Card ($66 MSRP)\n\n1TB\n\nLexar Play Pro ($200 MSRP)\nGameStop Express microSD Card for Nintendo Switch 2 ($190 MSRP)\n\nNintendo says the Switch 2 technically supports cards with a capacity up to 2TB, but we haven’t seen any microSD Express model go beyond 1TB just yet. It’s also worth noting that GameStop and Onn (Walmart’s in-house electronics brand) aren’t manufacturers, so it’s unclear who exactly is making their cards.\nStock for these cards remains somewhat patchy, particularly for the higher-capacity options. But many of the 128GB and 256GB models appear to be steadily available as of the Switch 2's launch week. Just be warned that you may have to deal with extended ship times in some cases. SanDisk’s microSD Express Card has also increased in price since it first went up for sale in February; originally, it cost $45 for 128GB and $60 for 256GB. \nEither way, all of these cards are far pricier than traditional microSD options. The Samsung Pro Plus, for example, costs $17 for 128GB, $25 for 256GB, $43 for 512GB and $90 for 1TB as of this writing.\nRemember: You’re looking for microSD Express, not “Extreme,” like the branding SanDisk uses for some of its conventional microSD cards. A microSD Express card will have a big “EX” logo printed on it — if you see that, you should be good to go.\nAll microSD Express cards will have this \"EX\" logo printed on them.Nintendo/Engadget\nWe’ve already tested SanDisk’s Express card and the Lexar Play Pro for our broader guide to the best microSD cards. Between the two, SanDisk’s card has much faster sequential read speeds — up to 899 MB/s vs. 712 MB/s in CrystalDiskMark, to name one benchmark — which theoretically makes it better equipped to reduce load times.\nThe Play Pro is quicker for sequential writes (up to 720 MB/s vs. 650 MB/s), available in more sizes and should be cheaper at 256GB whenever it’s in stock. (SanDisk says the 128GB version of its card has slower sequential writes than the 256GB model, too.) Random performance is about equal, so the two should be similarly adept at keeping large games like Mario Kart World running smoothly.\nWe mainly tested those cards on a Windows PC and Mac, though. How they perform on the actual Switch 2 remains to be seen. Nintendo didn’t send out early review units to press, and we've only just received our own retail model. So we’ll need a few more days to finish testing.\nFor now, though, we can’t say for sure if the console renders all microSD Express cards to similar speeds. That was largely the case with the first Switch: Once a (regular) microSD card hit a certain threshold of performance, there wasn’t that much practical difference between it and other alternatives. The Switch 2 is working with a different standard, but if something similar were to happen again, the “best” microSD Express card would simply be the most affordable one from a reputable brand in the capacity you want.\nThat brings us to our main piece of advice: If you can hold off on buying one of these things early on, that’s probably a good idea. It’s not just about the lack of testing — truthfully, we’d be surprised if any of these cards are truly “bad.”\nIt's more about value: Barring more tariff shenanigans, all of these cards are as expensive today as they’re ever likely to get. The Switch 2 is already popular and will continue to be, thus more microSD Express cards will need to be made and prices will (eventually) come down. Try to use all 256 of the gigabytes baked into the Switch 2 first, even if it means having to delete a game or two. But if you’re absolutely sure you want more space right away, the cards above should be good enough.\nWhat are microSD Express cards?\nA microSD Express card like the one on the right has a second row of pins on the back.Jeff Dunn for Engadget\nMost microSD cards are based on a standard called Ultra High Speed (UHS), of which there are three versions: UHS-I, UHS-II and UHS-III. The vast majority of cards you may have bought in the past utilize UHS-I. These have one row of pins in the back and a theoretical maximum data transfer speed of 104 megabytes per second (MB/s). (Though many cards are able to surpass that limit with proprietary tech and card readers.) The original Switch has a UHS-I microSD slot, as do most other gaming handhelds like Valve’s Steam Deck.\nUHS-II cards add a second row of pins and can reach up to 312 MB/s. These are pricier and much less common than cards based on UHS-I, but they’re supported by some cameras and higher-power handhelds like the ASUS ROG Ally X. UHS-III, meanwhile, is twice as fast as UHS-II in theory (624 MB/s), but no microSD cards have actually used it.\nUHS-I cards have held on over the years because they’re cheap, widely supported and fast enough for the things most people need them to do: record 4K video, stash photos and so on. But with the Switch 2, Nintendo needs more. The new console is dramatically more powerful, which allows it to run demanding games that may have originally been built for stronger hardware like the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X or gaming PCs. The device also uses UFS 3.1 storage internally, which is much speedier than the eMMC storage used by the original Switch. (A custom file decompression engine helps improve load times as well.) So if the Switch 2 is going to accept microSD cards, it needs ones that won’t bring a serious drop-off in performance and can hold up with modern games.\nThe Nintendo Switch 2.Sam Rutherford for Engadget\nHence, SD Express. This standard has technically been around since 2018 but mostly went nowhere until the Switch 2 came along. It also uses a second row of pins, but it lets microSD cards take advantage of the PCI Express (PCIe)/NVMe interface, which is the same underlying tech used by modern SSDs. As a result, it can produce considerably faster read and write speeds, with a current theoretical maximum of 985 MB/s.\nAs noted above, real-world performance won’t be quite that fast. Even if it was, the best microSD Express cards would still be much slower than the NVMe SSDs used by the PS5 and Xbox. (Sony recommends SSDs with sequential read speeds of at least 5,500 MB/s.) And they’ll fall well below their peak speeds under sustained loads: SanDisk, for instance, says sustained write speeds for its 128GB Express card can drop as low as 100 MB/s.\nBut they’re still a marked improvement over old UHS-I cards, and in theory, they should be quicker than some older SATA-based SSDs when it comes loading game levels, asset streaming, retrieving saves or copying games to external storage. Whereas SanDisk’s microSD Express card can produce sequential read speeds around 900 MB/s, Lexar’s Professional Silver Plus — the top UHS-I pick in our general microSD card guide — topped out just over 200 MB/s, and that’s with a proprietary reader. (On the first Switch, it’d be closer to 100 MB/s.) Sequential writes and random speeds were three to four times better as well, and sometimes even more depending on the benchmark we used.\nIt remains to be seen how well these Express cards will hold up with extended use, and there’s no way to know exactly when their sky-high prices will drop. Non-Switch 2 devices that support microSD Express are still exceedingly rare, and the standard itself isn’t backwards compatible with UHS-II, so you’ll be limited to UHS-I speeds if you want to use your card with another device (unless you buy a pricey external reader). Still, while the increased costs and limited selection are annoying, the tech itself seems worthy of a next-gen Switch.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/best-microsd-cards-for-nintendo-switch-2-160052947.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "If you’re hunting for the best projector, there’s never been a better time to dive in. Projectors aren’t just for movie buffs anymore — they’ve become a great way to upgrade your living room setup, build a cozy home theater or even host an epic outdoor movie night under the stars. Whether you want something ultra-portable or a full-on 4K home cinema experience, there’s a projector out there to fit just about every space and budget.The cool thing about the projectors you can get today is how versatile they are. Some models are built for gaming, some are designed for streaming your favorite shows and others are tough enough to take camping or on the road. Plus, newer projectors pack in smart features, better brightness and sharper image quality than ever before, making them a real alternative to a traditional TV. No matter what you're aiming for, we'll help you find the right projector to upgrade your setup.\nTable of contents\n\nBest projectors for 2025\nWhat to look for in a projector\nBest projector FAQs\n\nBest projectors for 2025\nSome projectors are for serious cinephiles, projecting sharp 4K video with HDR brightness and hyper realistic colors to a large screen. Others are bright enough to replace your TV for sports or gaming, and some low-cost portable models can be set up for camping or outdoor fun. That’s why we’ve divided this guide into several categories to help you find the right one. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhat to look for in a projector\nFor a deep dive on projector technology check my previous explainer, but there are few key things to keep in mind. What will the projector mainly be used for? What type of room will it be used in? And how big of an image do you want? You’ll also see a variety of specifications that may be confusing, so here are a few to consider and what they mean.\nBrightness and contrast\nBrightness is measured in ANSI lumens; the brighter the projector, typically the more expensive it will be. 1,500-2,500 lumens is good for darkened rooms, 3,000-4,000 lumens allows you to see with some ambient light and 4,000+ lumens is bright enough to use in direct sunlight. High contrast is important, because projectors are more sensitive to things like ambient light and reflections.\nDLP vs LCD\nDigital light processing units (DLPs) used by Optoma, BenQ, LG and others allow bright 4K images. The negative is that they can produce a “rainbow” effect, or red/blue/green artifacts that affect some viewers more than others. LCDs are used mainly by Epson, but also Sony and Sanyo. Those are often brighter, more color accurate and don’t produce rainbow effects, but are also more expensive and susceptible to image degradation over time.\nResolution\nIf you want a true 4K projector, beware: only expensive models have native 4K resolution (many movie theaters still use 2K projectors for various reasons). However, most DLP projectors and some LCD models can use pixel-shifting to attain 4K resolution.\n\n\n\n\n   Elite Starling \n \n\nHDR and color accuracy\nProjectors can’t produce anywhere close to the amount of light required to qualify as true HDR. Rather, they use a technique called tone mapping to fit the entire HDR gamut into a lower brightness range. That said, many projectors can display millions of colors, with some models surpassing the color accuracy of TVs and monitors.\nUST vs. classic\nClassic projectors and screens can be mounted on the ceiling so they’re great if you have no floor space. They can also project a larger video for a truly cinematic experience. UST projectors mount on the floor right next to the screen so they can take the place of a TV. They don’t beam as big an image but are generally brighter, sharper and more expensive. For best results, they require special screens.\nMounting and fan noise\nCeiling mounting requires some work and don’t forget to budget for a bracket and any necessary long cables, including extra power for a Google Chromecast or other streaming device. UST projectors require less labor, but getting the image perfectly square can still be surprisingly time-consuming. As for fan noise, some projectors (usually cheaper DLP models) generate more than others.\nOptics\nFor more flexibility with location and image size, ceiling mounted projectors need a good zoom range. Lens shift, meanwhile, is used if the projector is mounted higher or lower relative to the screen than recommended by the manufacturer. Otherwise, you might have to use a \"keystone correction\" to digitally stretch part of the image, resulting in distortion or artifacts. Also, keystore correction may not work in gaming modes for some models.\nGaming and streaming\nIf you’re interested in a projector for gaming, look up the refresh rate and input lag figures. Some projectors offer good numbers in that regard (240Hz and <20 ms, respectively), but others designed for home entertainment have very poor input lag and refresh rates at just 60 Hz. If it’s streaming you want, be sure to pick a model either with built-in Google TV or a bundled streaming dongle.\nScreens\nShould you project onto a wall, roll-down screen, fixed screen or ambient light rejecting (ALR) screen? The choice depends largely on the room and what kind of projector you have. Roll down screens take up no space as they’re ceiling mounted, fixed screens can be moved easily and ALR models are perfect in rooms with a lot of ambient light.\nBest projector FAQs\nAre 4K projectors better?\nYes, because higher resolution is more noticeable on larger screens, so 4K is particularly useful with projectors since they beam images up to 200 inches in size. That being said, brightness and contrast are more important.\nIs a projector better than a TV?\nProjectors can provide a more immersive experience thanks to the large screen, but they’re not necessarily “better.” Since you usually have to dim the lights with a projector, TVs are superior for everyday use.\nIs 2000 lumens bright enough for a projector?\nYes, 2000 lumens is easily bright enough, even with some ambient light in the room. However, the image will still be hard to see with the windows open on a bright day.\nShould I get a 4K or 1080p projector?\nThat depends on your budget and needs. If your budget is below $1,000, look for a 1080p projector with the best brightness and contrast. Between $1,000-$2,000, you’ll need to weigh whether brightness or 4K resolution is most important. Above that, choose the brightest 4K projector you can afford.\nWhat are the best projectors in daylight?\nThe best projectors in daylight are ultra short throw (UST) models, as they have the brightest and sharpest image. However, they generally cost more than $2,000.\nDo you need a screen for a better projector experience?\nTechnically, you don’t need a screen to use a projector — any light-colored, smooth wall can work in a pinch. But if you want to get the most out of your projector, a screen can make a difference. Projector screens are designed to reflect light evenly and enhance contrast, so colors look more vibrant and the picture appears sharper. With a screen, you’ll notice darker blacks and brighter colors, which can give a real boost to your movie nights or gaming sessions. So while you can absolutely enjoy a projector without one, a screen can make the experience feel a bit more like your own personal theater.\nShould I buy a portable or home projector?\nIt depends on how and where you plan to use it. If you want a projector you can easily move around, bring to friends’ houses or set up indoors or outdoors easily, a portable projector is a great choice. They’re usually smaller, lightweight and often have built-in speakers and batteries, making them convenient for on-the-go use.\nOn the other hand, if you’re looking for a more permanent setup for a home theater or living room, a home projector might be the way to go. Home projectors tend to be more powerful, with higher resolution and brightness, which gives you that crisp, cinema-quality experience. They’re ideal if you have a dedicated space and don’t mind leaving it set up in one spot.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/best-projectors-123004354.html?src=rss",

Alongside xAI’s DOD funding, the company announced that “Grok for Government” had been added to the General Services Administration schedule, meaning that xAI products are now available for purchase across every government office and agency. “The right question is this: would they ban Grok, the AI they just signed a large contract with, because it has been deliberately engineered to give politically charged answers?” Lemley said in an email interview. In some cases, an overabundance of caution among developers and AI trained on internet content that promotes values like inclusivity have led to distorted model outputs. Chowdhury says her biggest fear with this executive order is that AI companies will actively rework training data to tow the party line. Achieving unbiased or neutral results is impossible, especially in today’s world where even facts are politicized."

    "full_text": "YouTube continues to lead in the streaming market, with advertising revenue increasing by 13% year over year, according to Alphabet, Google’s parent company, in its second-quarter earnings report released on Wednesday. This growth brings YouTube’s total ad revenue to $9.8 billion, up from $8.7 billion in the same period last year. The company slightly exceeded analyst expectations, which had forecast YouTube’s Q2 ad revenue to be around $9.6 billion. For years, YouTube has been striving to capture a larger share of television ad dollars, especially as its popularity in TV has grown, accounting for a significant portion of its viewership. A recent report from Nielsen indicated that YouTube held the largest share of TV viewing for three consecutive months, representing 12.4% of the total audience time spent watching television. In response to YouTube’s success, rival streaming services, such as HBO Max and Amazon Prime Video, have ramped up their advertising strategies, increasing ad placements to stimulate growth. Additionally, Netflix is emerging as a key competitor to YouTube, particularly after the company announced during its earnings call last week its intention to double its advertising revenue within the year. Although Netflix has not publicly disclosed its ad revenue figures, an analyst from Madison & Wall estimates that it’s around $3 billion. Overall, Alphabet reported strong results, with total revenue of $96.4 billion in the second quarter, representing a 13% year-over-year increase."

    "summary": "After largely focusing Google I/O 2025 on the ways the company wants Gemini to change everything from searching the web to filmmaking, Google is finally ready to launch new hardware. The next Made by Google event is on the books for August 20, and Google has already confirmed what at least one of its new Pixel 10 phones will look like.\nAs in past years, Google isn't the only source for information on its new phones and wearables. Nearly all the new hardware the company is expected to announce has leaked in one form or another ahead of the event. With that in mind and after sifting through what's leaked, here's what Google is likely to show off at the Pixel 10 launch event in New York City on August 20.\nPixel 10, 10 Pro, 10 Pro XL and 10 Pro Fold\nAndroid Headlines / Onleaks \nGoogle's invitation for the event says that the company is sharing \"the latest on our Pixel phones, watches, buds and more,” which more or less confirms the company will introduce a slate of products that's similar to what it launched in 2024. That means a Pixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro, Pixel 10 Pro XL and Pixel 10 Pro Fold are absolutely on the menu.\nGoogle's tease of the Pixel 10 confirmed what leaked renders have already signaled: the company isn't abandoning the new design language the Pixel 9 established. The pill-shaped camera bump and flat front display will still be present on the Pixel 10, and the real changes will be in the details, like for example, how the flat sides of the Pixel 10 join with the phone's back.\nThose subtle changes will apparently also include the thickness of the Pixel 10s. While both the Pixel 10, 10 Pro, 10 Pro XL and 10 Pro Fold will use the same sized OLED screens as their Pixel 9 counterparts, they'll be housed in thicker and heavier bodies, according to Android Headlines. Google's new Pixels are also supposed to come in new colors. The Pixel 10 will come in \"Frost\" (a royal blue), \"Lemongrass\" (a yellow), \"Indigo\" (a light purple) and \"Obsidian\" (a dark gray), while the Pixel 10 Pro / Pro XL will come in Obsidian, \"Porcelain\" (off-white), \"Moonstone\" (a bluish gray) and \"Jade\" (a light green). Less information is known about the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, though recent leaks suggest it'll come in Moonstone and Jade, as well.\nAndroid Headlines\nThe most visible external change that'll be introduced on the Pixel 10 is the addition of a new telephoto camera. The new telephoto camera is a 11-megapixel 5x telephoto, Android Authority reports, similar to the one on the Pixel 9 Pro Fold. Meanwhile, the Pixel 10 Pro and 10 Pro XL are expected to feature a 50-megapixel wide, 48-megapixel ultrawide, 48-megapixel telephoto and 48-megapixel selfie cameras. The Pixel 10 Pro Fold could feature a different lineup, with a similar main camera, but 12-megapixel ultrawide and telephoto cameras, and 11-megapixel selfie cameras.\nInside the new phones, Google is laying the groundwork for future performance gains with a new Tensor G5 chip. It's likely be much more power-efficient thanks to the company switching to a 3nm design produced by TSMC. Reports suggest the chip might not be all that different in terms of raw power, but the Tensor G5 is likely designed to be extra capable when it comes to using local AI features.\nPixel Watch 4\n91mobiles / Onleaks\nThe third time was the charm for the Pixel Watch 3, so the main task Google has with the Pixel Watch 4 is to not squander the solid base it already has. Leaks for the company's new smartwatches have been limited so far, but renders of the Pixel Watch 4 shared by 91mobiles do suggest Google has a few changes planned.\nNamely, much like the company's phones, the new Pixel Watch seems like it'll be a little bit thicker and come with smaller bezels. The Pixel Watch 4 should be available to purchase in the same 41mm and 45mm sizes as before, but a thicker frame that could accommodate a larger battery, or a new wireless charging system. Notably, the renders are missing the charging pins used on the Pixel Watch 3.\nBeyond that, Google has already indicated how Wear OS is evolving. The new Wear OS 6 update is debuting on the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8, and will presumably be available on the Pixel Watch 4 at launch. It includes built-in access to Gemini, among other tweaks. Given Google also manages the Fitbit Premium subscription, it wouldn't be all that surprising if the Pixel Watch 4 gets some exclusive fitness tracking features, too.\nPixel Buds 2a\nBilly Steele for Engadget\nGoogle launched the Pixel Buds Pro 2 last year, and it typically doesn't update its premium earbuds on a yearly cadence. So instead, Tom's Guide reports Google might pair the Pixel 10 with the Pixel Buds Pro 2 in a new color, and save its new hardware announcements for a sequel to the Pixel Buds A-series called the Pixel Buds 2a.\nUnlike the company's premium wireless earbuds, the A-series Pixel Buds have historically skimped on things like active noise cancellation to hit a lower price. There's little reporting on where Google will take the Pixel Buds 2a, but you can expect the new earbuds to come in some of the new colors being introduced on the Pixel 10.\nPixelsnap\nThe Qi2 wireless charging standard is available for all phone makers to use, but it hasn't been widely adopted among Android phone makers. Qi2 uses magnets to offer improved charging speeds, just like Apple's MagSafe, and the Pixel 10 could mark Google's adoption of Qi2 through a new feature called \"Pixelsnap.\"\nA report from Android Authority suggests the Pixel 10 will include the necessary magnets to make Qi2 happen, and will be introduced alongside a lineup of Pixelsnap accessories. Adding some weight to the report, the Wireless Power Consortium has announced that its faster Qi2 25W charging is coming to \"major Android phones.\" It would make sense if Google's Pixel 10s were included.\nGemini and other exclusive software features\nGemini is Google's current favorite, and the company is pushing the AI assistant everywhere it makes sense. The last few Pixel Drops — Google's regular Pixel-focused software updates — have primarily included Gemini features. It would make sense for Google to include a few more software exclusives on the Pixel 10.\nGoogle is hosting the Pixel 10 launch event on August 20 at 1PM ET / 10AM ET. The company has invited press to attend in person, and you can read coverage of everything Google announces right here on Engadget.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/what-to-expect-at-the-google-pixel-10-launch-event-on-august-20-214510264.html?src=rss",

In addition, Google’s Gemini app has grown to 450 million monthly active users. “We continue to see strong growth and engagement with daily requests growing over 50% from Q1,” Pichai said of the app. Meanwhile, AI Mode — a way to use Google Search via an AI chat experience to get more in-depth answers — has over 100 million monthly active users, Pichai said. On the developer front, Google said more than 9 million have built with Gemini and over 70 million videos have been produced with the Veo 3 AI model since May. The stats are meant to illustrate consumer demand for AI features. For instance, Google shared that AI Overviews were driving over 10% more Google Search queries, for the types of searches that show them. Across Google’s platform and products, Google quantified its growth by monthly tokens processed, saying that it had announced at its developer conference in May that it had processed 480 trillion monthly tokens, and that figure has now doubled to 980 trillion monthly tokens. “We are seeing significant demand for our comprehensive AI product portfolio,” Pichai told investors. “Of course, this is all possible because of the long-term investments we have made in our differentiated, full-stack approach to AI.”"

    "summary": "At its best, AI is a tool, not an end result. It allows people to do their jobs better, rather than sending them or their colleagues to the breadline. In an example of \"the good kind,\" Google DeepMind has created an AI model that restores and contextualizes ancient inscriptions. Aeneas (no, it's not pronounced like that) is named after the hero in Roman mythology. Best of all, the tool is open-source and free to use.\nAncient Romans left behind a plethora of inscriptions. But these texts are often fragmented, weathered or defaced. Rebuilding the missing pieces is a grueling task that requires contextual cues. An algorithm that can pore over a dataset of those cues can come in handy.\nAeneas speeds up one of historians' most difficult tasks: identifying \"parallels.\" In this setting, that means finding similar texts arranged by wording, syntax or region. DeepMind says the model reasons across thousands of Latin inscriptions. It can fetch parallels in seconds before passing the baton back to historians.\nDeepMind says it turns each text into a historical fingerprint of sorts. \"Aeneas identifies deep connections that can help historians situate inscriptions within their broader historical context,\" the Google subsidiary wrote.\nGoogle DeepMind\nOne of Aeneas' most impressive tricks is restoring textual gaps of unknown length. (Think of it as filling out a crossword puzzle where you don't know how many letters are in each clue.) The tool is also multimodal, meaning it can analyze both textual and visual input. DeepMind says it's the first model that can use that multi-pronged method to figure out where a text came from.\nDeepMind says Aeneas is designed to be a collaborative ally within historians' existing workflows. It's best used to offer \"interpretable suggestions\" that serve as a starting point for researchers. \"Aeneas' parallels completely changed my perception of the inscription,\" an unnamed historian who tested the model wrote. \"It noticed details that made all the difference for restoring and chronologically attributing the text.\"\nAlongside the release of Aeneas for Latin text, DeepMind also upgraded Ithaca. (That's its model for Ancient Greek text.) Ithaca is now powered by Aeneas, receiving its contextual and restorative superpowers.\nResearchers can take Aeneas for a spin at DeepMind's \"Predicting the Past\" website.

    "summary": "2024 was an awful year for Sonos. Its long-awaited entry into a crowded headphones market was eclipsed by a bungled app launch which had a knock-on effect that impacted everything the company had planned to do for the rest of the year. Plus, those Ace headphones were missing a major feature.\nOne year later, that TrueCinema spatial audio enhancement is finally ready. And with that update, Sonos added a few more improvements to the Ace, including two-person TV Audio Swap, adaptive noise cancellation and better calls. I spent some time testing every aspect of the update that arrived in June to determine if Sonos’ headphones really are better after the tweaks.\nTrueCinema is finally here\nThe first time I tried the Ace at a press event last spring, TrueCinema was one of the main parts of the demo. From the jump, Sonos was clear this wouldn’t arrive when the headphones first went on sale, but I also didn’t expect the company to take a full year to have it ready.\nAs a refresher, TrueCinema is a feature for the Ace that takes into account the acoustics of the room where one of its soundbars is located. It then creates spatial audio for the headphones based on that info when TV Audio Swap is active. According to Sonos, it supposedly “understands the dynamics of your space, acoustically treats it and makes it sound like you have a beautifully tuned 3D audio system right in your headphones.” It’s similar to the company’s TruePlay tuning that calibrates its soundbars to your living room or home theater space.\nSonos has championed TrueCinema as a more realistic listening experience. Since it simulates the characteristics of the room, it’s supposed to make it seem like you aren’t wearing headphones at all. I’m not convinced on that point, but the feature does significantly enhance the spatial audio capabilities of the Ace for TV Audio Swap.\nFor example, subtle details in movies — things like footsteps, as well as various beeps, clicks and taps in Rogue One — are a lot more obvious with TrueCinema. There’s more overall depth and direction to the sound as well, which makes this the optimal mode for watching TV or movies with Sonos’ headphones. I’m confident my review score would’ve been higher if this was part of the original package since it makes such an obvious improvement to sound quality.\nTV Audio Swap for two\nBilly Steele for Engadget\nThe marquee feature for the Sonos Ace for the last year has been TV Audio Swap. This allows you to send the sound from a compatible Sonos soundbar to the headphones for an individual listening experience. Of course, this means you can watch an action flick at full volume after your family goes to bed or to tune in to a sporting event without annoying your partner. This has worked well for me both during my review and in the time since.\nUnfortunately, I don’t have a second pair of the Ace, so I can’t vouch for how well TV Audio Swap now works with a companion. But since the ability to send soundbar audio to two sets of Ace headphones is one of the main items in the recent software update, I can’t discuss the overall state of the device without mentioning this feature’s availability.\nImproved ANC and clearer calls\nAnother aspect of the Ace’s update is improved active noise cancellation (ANC), but not in the way you might expect. The company didn’t figure out a way to block more noise per se, but it does account for any sound leaks that may impact performance. Sonos says its refined ANC setup can adapt to changes in fit caused by hair, glasses and hats in real time using the sensors inside the Ace. With that tweak, I noticed the slightest difference in ANC performance when sunglasses or a hat kept the ear pads from sitting flush on my face, but it’s not quite as good as a tight seal. I’d characterize this update as a modest improvement, but it’s still an improvement nonetheless.\nSonos also claims that this software update offers an improved call experience thanks to higher resolution audio. The company also added Sidetone, or the ability for you to pipe in your voice during calls when ANC is enabled. Plenty of companies have this, to varying degrees, and the effectiveness depends on how natural the sound is and whether or not you’re able to make any adjustments. In the case of the Ace, Sidetone acts as an enhanced ambient mode, and it definitely improves the call experience. Since I could speak normally and didn’t feel the need to shout to hear myself, video and voice calls felt more natural.\nWrap-up\nA year after their debut, the Sonos Ace is living up to the lofty expectations the company set when the headphones arrived. After spending time with this batch of updates, I’m convinced the Ace would’ve benefitted from having all of this ready at launch, especially TrueCinema. Since one of the Ace’s main functions is personal living room listening, taking so long to deliver the feature that would boost sound quality this much is another misstep.\nOn the other hand, it’s good to see Sonos is still working to improve the Ace. When you consider the company spent most of 2024 fixing a majorly botched app redesign, it would have been understandable if Sonos left the Ace to languish until it was time for version 2.0. The company had to delay products last summer, and according to a report in March, it even canceled another entirely. When CEO Patrick Spence resigned in January, interim chief executive Tom Conrad expressed the need for “getting back to basics” (Conrad was named permanent CEO on July 23). Improving a major new product that was overshadowed by a poor run of form is certainly one way to reclaim some of your reputation. It also doesn’t hurt that the Ace is currently available for $149 less than its original $449 price.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/a-year-later-the-sonos-ace-is-finally-fulfilling-its-potential-170035355.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "My dream projector delivers the brightest and sharpest image. But it also has to be easy to move around and set up anywhere — especially outdoors. Anker’s Nebula X1 long-throw projector promises all of that with a three-laser engine that beams out a category-leading 3,500 ANSI lumens at 4K resolution. It also has features never seen before on a home projector, like liquid cooling to reduce fan noise and a motorized lens gimbal that automates setup. Plus, it offers good sound that can be upgraded with optional satellite speakers.\nThe rub is the price. At $3,000 ($3,298 with the satellite speakers for a limited time) it’s one of the more expensive consumer projectors, right up there with models like Epson’s LS11000 or the Valerion VisionMaster Pro2. After testing it, I can say that it offers the clearest, most vivid image quality I’ve seen and has the simplest setup to boot. However, the high price puts it far out of reach for most portable projector buyers. \n\n\nFeatures and design\nThe Nebula X1 follows in the footsteps of other Anker projectors, like the original Nebula and Cosmos, with a tall rectangular design and handle that neatly retracts with a press. While that makes it easy to carry, it also means the Nebula X1 hangs down more than most indoor projectors when ceiling-mounted.\nTo eliminate the tedious setup that typically plagues projectors, Anker did a clever thing: it placed the lens mechanism on a gimbal that can tilt up to 25 degrees. When combined with a 1.67x zoom, autofocus, keystone correction and ambient light detection, the projector fully automates setup. First, you have to choose a screen or wall location and position the projector at a prescribed distance between 8 and 35 feet, depending on the screen or wall size. You should center the projector as well as you can to avoid any digital (keystone) correction that can adversely affect image quality. Then the magic happens at the press of a button.\nThe Nebula X1 uses a function it calls Spatial Adaptation to scan the area in front of it. The lens tilts up and down, before displaying a checkerboard pattern and then beaming the final image pretty much precisely where it should be. It’s not perfect, as some obstacles like small plants or fine wires can throw it off, but it worked nicely for me on both a wall and dedicated screen. The projector can adapt to ambient light and even the wall color, and another function called Spatial Recall lets you save those settings for frequently used locations.\n\n\n\n  The Nebula X1's Spatial Adaptation feature in action.\n \n\n  Steve Dent for Engadget\n \n\nLaser engines get hot and are normally cooled with fans that can generate distracting noise. However, the Nebula X1 is the first consumer model with liquid cooling which reduces fan noise to a barely audible 26dB whisper. Thanks to this cooling system, the projector can also have a smaller footprint. That’s a big quality-of-life improvement compared to much of the competition.\nAs for inputs, the X1 comes with two HDMI 2.1 ports, including one with Enhanced Audio Return Channel (eARC) functionality. That standard supports fast refresh rates of up to 240Hz at 4K, though the X1 tops out at 4K 60Hz so it’s not ideal as a gaming projector. It also offers USB Type-A and USB Type-C ports, along with a S/PDIF optical audio port.\nGoogle TV is built in for streaming and projector control. It provides a large library of apps via Google Play along with a familiar interface. You also get Netflix’s official application with support for 4K Dolby Vision without the need to plug in a streaming device, plus Chromecast support and Google Assistant for voice control. The downside is that it can occasionally be sluggish, particularly with menu settings like projector image control.\nImage quality\n\n\n\n\n  Steve Dent for Engadget\n \n\nAnker uses what it calls “cinema-grade glass” in the Nebula’s 14-element lens to increase brightness, color accuracy and lens durability. The 4K triple laser engine is rated at up to 3,500 ANSI lumens with a 5,000:1 contrast ratio. At the same time, it offers color accuracy with a Delta E value of less than 0.8 and an impressive 110 percent of the Rec.2020 color spectrum, matching high-end ultra short throw (UST) models from Samsung, LG and Formovie. That 4K Dolby Vision support I mentioned is also rare among the competition.\nThe result is the sharpest and brightest image I’ve seen on any projector in this price range. It was bright enough for me to comfortably watch a soccer match on a sunny day without the shades lowered. And if you switch it to Conference mode, you can ramp the brightness up further for a viewable image even with lights on, but there’s the downside of a slight blue color cast.\nWhen used in a darkened room or outside at night, the Nebula’s image quality is the best of any projector I’ve tested. Even though it uses the same Texas Instruments 0.47-inch DMD (digital mirror device) as many other 4K models, the image is clearer and sharper thanks to the glass element lens. Contrast and black levels are also tops in this price range and not far off high-end projectors from JVC and Sony that cost twice as much. Once again, that’s due to the optics along with Anker’s 6-blade dynamic iris — another feature usually only found on high-end projectors — and the company’s “NebulaMaster 2.0” picture quality algorithm.\nColor accuracy is outstanding out of the box in both HDR and non-HDR modes thanks to the ISF (Image Science Foundation) certification normally reserved for more expensive projectors. In fact, I found the color calibration nearly perfect on my unit in “ISF Night” mode. That meant images were close to how they were calibrated by the filmmakers for TV series and movies like Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, Andor, Dune 2 and Spider-Man: No Way Home. If the colors aren’t quite to your liking, you can make fine adjustments manually. Like many other 4K projectors of this type, the X1 has a slight amount of light spill around the edge of the image. However, it’s well-controlled and only noticeable when the projected image is particularly dark.\nSound\n\n\n\n\n  Steve Dent for Engadget\n \n\nAnker put some extra work into the sound as well. Audio quality is solid thanks to the four built-in speakers with 40 watts total output. The lack of fan noise is a big help here. By itself, the X1 offers decent high-end and bass, but more importantly, dialog is easy to hear and understand.\nFor a big sonic upgrade, you can add a pair of Anker’s optional Nebula-branded satellite speakers that connect to the projector automatically via Wi-Fi. Each one has a pair of 40-watt front drivers, a 20-watt upward-firing driver and a 20-watt side-firing driver that combine to create a surround effect. Together with the projector, they deliver an impressive 200 watts of sound with Dolby Audio support (though not Dolby Atmos unfortunately). They’re also battery-powered with up to eight hours of use, which is especially handy for outdoor viewing. However, that also means you need to keep them charged.\nTo test these speakers, I selected several music-oriented movies including A Complete Unknown, Maestro and Rocketman, along with an action movie that has an impressive score and sound effects, Dune 2. In spite of their small size, the satellite speakers kept elements like music, dialog and sound effects crisp, clear and evenly balanced with powerful dynamic bass. You could certainly do better with a dedicated 5.1 or 7.1 surround sound system, but these speakers offer very respectable audio quality, are easy to set up and automatically sync with the picture. The X1 also supports other external Bluetooth speakers, but you may have to adjust the timing in the menus to ensure perfect sync for picture and sound.\nAnker also offers a $4,000 package that includes a pair of its Soundcore microphones along with the speakers. Those also connect to the X1 automatically and let you use it as a very expensive karaoke machine. They provide clear sound but you don’t get the usual benefits of a karaoke setup like AI vocal removal and vocal enhancement.\nWrap-up\n\n\n\n  The Nebula X1 offers a pair of HDMI 2.1 ports along with USB-C, USB-A and S/PIDF\n \n\n  Steve Dent for Engadget\n \n\nThe Nebula X1 is an odd proposition. It’s marketed as a portable outdoor projector, but it also happens to be the best indoor projector I’ve ever tested. With an impeccably sharp, high-contrast and color-accurate image, the video quality is irreproachable. The ease of setup and overall size also makes it an outstanding choice if you want to move the X1 around. With the optional satellite speakers, it’s the best portable projector you can get, hands down.\nThe Nebula X1 doesn’t have a lot of competition in the portable category, apart from Valerion’s $3,000 VisionMaster Pro 2, which also has a 4K triple laser engine. However, the X1 beats that model on image quality, portability and ease of setup.\nThe thing is, most people looking for a portable projector won’t spend more than $500, let alone $3,000. So who is this for? I think it’s ideal for buyers looking at a UST or high-end long-throw projector who want a bit more versatility. Some may even use it as a standalone indoor projector as it can be mounted on the ceiling or on a stand. In other words, if you have the means, use it any way you want — it’s that versatile.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/anker-nebula-x1-projector-review-the-king-of-outdoor-movies-if-you-can-afford-it-161519956.html?src=rss",

Lumo can search the web to answer questions beyond its knowledge cut-off date, but by default that feature is turned off to further protect user privacy. You can also upload files to Lumo. Here again Proton says the chatbot won't save any information.\nProton isn't touting the performance of Lumo's large language models, but if you're curious about this sort of thing, it's powered by a handful of open-source systems, including Mistral NeMo and Mistral Small 3, among others. Proton told The Verge Lumo will filter requests through the model best suited for the task. For example, it will use NVIDIA's OpenHands system for coding requests.\nLumo is free to use, with a weekly query limit. You don't need a Proton account to begin a conversation with the chatbot. In addition to being available on the web, Proton offers both Android and iOS apps. A $13 per month Plus plan offers unlimited usage, alongside perks like larger uploads, access to more advanced AI models, priority support and more.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/protons-privacy-focused-lumo-chatbot-encrypts-all-your-conversations-144551345.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Apple has introduced a new tier of its AppleCare insurance policy called AppleCare One. This allows you to cover up to three of your Apple products under a single plan for $20 per month. If you want to add extra devices beyond that, you can do so for an additional $6 per month, per product.\nApple first introduced AppleCare+ in 2011 as a means of insuring your iPhone against accidental damage, and has since expanded the plan to its entire product line, adding coverage for theft and loss. Currently, AppleCare+ costs from $10 per month to insure an individual iPhone, with subscription prices starting at $3.49 per month for a Mac, and $5 for an iPad, depending on the model you own. You can also insure your Apple Watch, Vision Pro headset, AirPods, Apple TV and HomePod either individually, or as part of your new AppleCare One plan.\nAppleCare One features all the same benefits as AppleCare+, including unlimited repairs for accidents such as drops and spills, round-the-clock support from Apple experts, servicing and battery coverage. The theft and loss protection that was previously exclusive to iPhone plans now also covers iPad and Apple Watch if they’re included in your AppleCare One plan. You can make up to three claims a year for theft or loss of an iPhone, iPad or Apple Watch.\nThe $20 monthly price is fixed regardless of which products you include (as is the $6 you pay to add an additional device), meaning the amount you actually save will depend on what they would cost to insure individually, so it’s worth looking into that before you take out the new plan. Apple says that people who cover their iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch could save as much as $11 per month on AppleCare One compared to what they’d pay if each device was insured under AppleCare+.\nAlso new with AppleCare One is the ability to add devices you already own to a protection plan. Previously you’d have to decide within 60 days of purchasing an Apple device. Apple says that providing they’re under four years old, are in good condition when added and are in your Apple account, they can be covered under AppleCare One. You may need to run a diagnostic check either on the device itself or at an Apple Store to get it approved.\nAppleCare One also simplifies the trade-in process. If you trade in a product covered by your plan directly to Apple, it is automatically taken out and replaced by the new device. Unlike AppleCare+, though, there doesn’t appear to be a way to pay annually for your plan. Instead, it rolls monthly for as long as you need it, and Apple will let you move products in and out of coverage whenever you want.\nAppleCare One launches tomorrow in the US, and can be activated either on your iPhone, Mac or iPad, or in an Apple Store.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/applecare-one-lets-you-protect-three-devices-under-one-subscription-135559271.html?src=rss",

We're excited to get our hands on some of the newest Switch 2 accessories (more on those below), but plenty of our favorite classics are compatible with the Switch 2 as well as older versions of the console.

    "full_text": "The Switch 2 Pro controller is the best controller Nintendo has ever made – and that’s saying something. It’s incredibly comfortable to hold, its joysticks are buttery smooth, and all of its buttons are wonderfully responsive. Nintendo even made it customizable this time with rear buttons that can easily be mapped inside of any game. The Switch 2 Pro Controller costs $85, which seems a bit egregious when you can get an excellent controller like 8BitDo’s Ultimate 2 wireless gamepad for $60. As good as the competition is, though, you won’t find anything that can be easily configured directly from within the Switch 2’s user interface. My hands often feel cramped when I play that game with the Switch 2’s Joy-Con 2 controllers for too long. But there’s none of that with the Switch 2 Pro controller. I was able to race for an hour without any discomfort, and I also noticed that it was easier for me to pull off the game’s tricky jump maneuvers and rail sliding. The Switch 2 Pro controller is also seriously helpful with fighting games, thanks to its smooth and accurate directional pad. It acquits itself to most genres easily, though it would have been nice to see analog triggers for more precise control in serious racing games."

    "summary": "Meta is adding some of its teen safety features to Instagram accounts featuring children, even if they're ran by adults. While children under 13 years of age aren't allowed to sign up on the social media app, Meta allows adults like parents and managers to run accounts for children and post videos and photos of them. The company says that these accounts are \"overwhelmingly used in benign ways,\" but they're also targeted by predators who leave sexual comments and ask for sexual images in DMs. \nIn the coming months, the company is giving these adult-ran kid accounts its strictest message settings to prevent unsavory DMs. It will also automatically turn on Hidden Words for them so that account owners can filter out unwanted comments on their posts. In addition, Meta will avoid recommending them to accounts blocked by teen users to lessen the chances predators finding them. The company will also make it harder for suspicious users to find them through search and will hide comments from potentially suspicious adults on their posts. Meta says will continue \"to take aggressive action\" on accounts breaking its rules: It has already removed 135,000 Instagram accounts for leaving sexual comments on and requesting sexual images from adult-managed accounts featuring children earlier this year. It also deleted an additional, 500,000 Facebook and Instagram accounts linked to those original ones.\nMeta introduced teen accounts on Instagram last year to automatically opt users 13 to 18 years of age into stricter privacy features. The company then launched teen accounts on Facebook and Messenger in April and is even testing AI age-detection tech to determine whether a supposed adult user has lied about their birthday so they could be moved to a teen account if needed. \nSince then, Meta has rolled out more and more safety features meant for younger teens. It released Location Notice in June to let younger teens know that they're chatting with someone from another country, since sextortion scammers typically lie about their location. (To note, authorities have observed a huge increase in \"sextortion\" cases involving kids being threatened online to send explicit images.) Meta also introduced a nudity protection feature, which blurs images in DM detected as containing nudity, since sextortion scammers may send nude pictures first in an effort to convince a victim to send reciprocate. \nToday, Meta is also launching new ways for teens to view safety tips. When they chat with someone in DMs, they can now tap on the \"Safety Tips\" icon at the top of the conversation to bring up a screen where they can restrict, block or report the other user. Meta has also launched a combined block and report option in DMs, so that users can take both actions together in one tap. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/meta-is-adding-new-safety-features-to-kid-focused-ig-accounts-run-by-adults-110000524.html?src=rss",

The company says that these accounts are \"overwhelmingly used in benign ways,\" but they're also targeted by predators who leave sexual comments and ask for sexual images in DMs. The company will also make it harder for suspicious users to find them through search and will hide comments from potentially suspicious adults on their posts. Meta says will continue \"to take aggressive action\" on accounts breaking its rules: It has already removed 135,000 Instagram accounts for leaving sexual comments on and requesting sexual images from adult-managed accounts featuring children earlier this year. It also deleted an additional, 500,000 Facebook and Instagram accounts linked to those original ones. The company then launched teen accounts on Facebook and Messenger in April and is even testing AI age-detection tech to determine whether a supposed adult user has lied about their birthday so they could be moved to a teen account if needed. It released Location Notice in June to let younger teens know that they're chatting with someone from another country, since sextortion scammers typically lie about their location. (To note, authorities have observed a huge increase in \"sextortion\" cases involving kids being threatened online to send explicit images.) Meta also introduced a nudity protection feature, which blurs images in DM detected as containing nudity, since sextortion scammers may send nude pictures first in an effort to convince a victim to send reciprocate. Today, Meta is also launching new ways for teens to view safety tips."

    "summary": "Whether you're backing up important files, editing videos on the go or just freeing up space on your laptop, a fast and reliable SSD drive can make your workflow a whole lot smoother. The best portable SSD options in 2025 combine speed, durability and wide compatibility, often using USB Type-C connections for quick transfers across devices. Unlike a traditional thumb drive or even the best external hard drives, these compact powerhouses can offer faster read speeds, often hitting several hundred or even thousands of Mbps, especially with high-performance NVMe SSD models.Whether you're managing large files or launching apps directly from your drive, we've rounded up the best SSDs that deliver excellent performance without weighing you down.\nTable of contents\n\nBest external SSDs for 2025\nOther external SSDs we tested\nWhat to consider before buying an external SSD\nHow we test external SSDs\nRecent updates\n\nBest external SSDs for 2025\n \n \n \nOther external SSDs we tested\nThe pre-built OWC Express 1M2 is a premium-feeling USB4 SSD that’s roughly as fast as the ADATA SE920, but it’s larger and significantly more expensive as of this writing. \nIf you’re in the relatively small group with a PC that supports USB 3.2 Gen 2x2 but not Thunderbolt or USB4, the Crucial X10 Pro is essentially a faster version of our top pick. The Lexar SL600 is a larger but slightly quicker option, while the Lexar SL500, Kingston XS2000 or Samsung T9 could also work if you see them on discount. As a reminder, though, drives like these are aimed primarily at content creators and other professionals, and you have to make sure you won’t upgrade to a device with a faster USB interface anytime soon.\nThe Samsung T7 Shield has a conveniently rugged design with a rubberized, IP65-rated shell. It also comes with both USB-C and USB-A cables. But it was consistently slower than the X9 Pro and XS1000 in our benchmark tests, plus it has a shorter three-year warranty.\nThe Silicon Power PX10 is an especially affordable USB 3.2 Gen 2 model. Its peak speeds weren’t too far off the X9 Pro or XS1000 in synthetic benchmarks, but it can get distractingly hot and its sustained writes are markedly worse. It took 50 seconds longer to move our 70GB custom test folder to this drive compared to the X9 Pro, for example.\nThe Crucial X6 is another low-cost option that’s a good bit slower than our top picks. It’s limited to a three-year warranty and lacks an IP rating as well. It’s not a terrible option for the basics, but there’s little reason to get it over the XS1000 when their prices are similar.\nThe OWC Envoy Pro FX is well-built and supports Thunderbolt 3 and USB 3.2 Gen 2, but it’s a smidge slower than the SE920 and Express 1M2, and it’s much pricier than the former.\n\n\n\n   The Samsung T9 portable SSD. \n \n\n   Samsung \n \n\nWhat to consider before buying an external SSD\nCapacity\nThe first thing to figure out before buying a portable SSD is just how much storage space you need. Most of the SSD drives we considered for this guide are available in capacities ranging from one to four terabytes, though plenty of smaller and larger options exist.\nThere’s no hard-and-fast rule for which size is “best” — that’ll ultimately depend on your budget and what exactly you’re looking to stash. But in general, it’s better to overcompensate than underdo it. Nobody wants to be forced into buying a second drive because they filled the first one up too quickly. If you’re backing up a PC, a good rule of thumb is to buy an external SSD with twice as much space as your computer’s internal storage. This way, you can save at least one full backup while also having room for additional data. If you want to store a bunch of PlayStation or Xbox games with huge install sizes, you may need more space. If you just want to back up a small collection of files, you may be better off saving your cash and just getting a smaller USB flash drive or thumb drive instead, which aren’t quite the same as the best portable SSDs we tested for this guide.\nPrice\nIn general, you get a better price-per-gigabyte ratio the further you go up the capacity ladder. As of this writing, the 1TB Samsung T9 is priced at $130, or $0.13 per gigabyte (GB), while the 4TB version is available for $297 or $0.07 per GB. That technically makes the larger model a better “value,” but not everyone needs to pay that much more upfront.\nSSDs in the same speed class tend to not vary too wildly in terms of performance, so part of our decision-making for this guide came down to which ones are often the cheapest. But prices can fluctuate over time; if you see that one of our top picks is priced way higher than a comparable honorable mention, feel free to get the latter. At this point in time, costs are broadly trending upwards for even the best SSDs.\n\n\n\n   The ADATA SE920 portable SSD connected to an Apple MacBook Pro. \n \n\n   Photo by Jeff Dunn / Engadget \n \n\nSpeed and USB interface\nJust about all external SSDs are significantly faster than mechanical hard disk drives (HDDs), so you’ll save time waiting for files to transfer and games to load no matter what. Within the market, however, there are distinct performance tiers. These are defined in large part by the USB interface a drive supports. While all of the SSDs we considered for this guide can connect over USB Type-C, some USB-C connections can supply faster transfer speeds than others. Sorting through this can get real confusing real fast, so we’ll try to put it in simple terms.\nYou can essentially divide today’s crop of portable SSDs into different segments. At the very top are drives that utilize the (relatively) new Thunderbolt 5 standard, which has a theoretical maximum transfer rate of 80 gigabits per second (Gbps). (You may see it advertise speeds up to 120 Gbps, but that boost doesn’t apply to storage devices.) But portable SSDs that support this tech only just started to trickle out toward the end of 2024, and the market for devices with Thunderbolt 5 ports is still fairly limited, with the most notable exceptions being Apple’s top-end Macs with an M4 Pro or M4 Max chip.\nThunderbolt 5 is built on a spec called USB4, which can technically reach up to 80 Gbps as well but is more typically available in a flavor that tops out at 40 Gbps. Portable SSDs based on that standard started to roll out toward the end of 2023 but are still relatively infrequent. The older Thunderbolt 3 and Thunderbolt 4, which other high-end external SSDs continue to use, support the same 40 Gbps maximum.\nA third version of USB4, meanwhile, maxes at 20 Gbps, as does an older yet more frequently used standard called USB 3.2 Gen 2x2. Below that is USB 3.2 Gen 2, which maxes at 10 Gbps. Then there’s USB 3.2 Gen 1, which is capped at 5 Gbps. Lastly, we’ll bundle together SSDs that use older standards and aren’t worth considering here.\nTo make this easy: For everyday folks, a good USB 3.2 Gen 2 drive is the sweet spot between fast-enough performance, wide-enough compatibility and cheap-enough price, so those make up our primary recommendations above. If you work in a creative field or don’t mind paying extra to shave seconds off your large file transfers, though, a “higher-tier” model would make sense. However, note that actual computers that utilize USB 3.2 Gen 2x2 aren’t super common — no Mac supports it, for one — and the interface is effectively being replaced by USB4.\nIn general, your chain is only as strong as its weakest link: If your computer only has USB 3.2 Gen 2 ports, for example, you could still use a Thunderbolt SSD, but you won’t get beyond Gen 2 speeds. Make sure you know what you’re working with before you buy.\nAs a refresher, storage devices are broadly measured in terms of read speeds and write speeds. The former refers to how long it takes to access something from the drive; the latter, how long it takes to save something to it. From there, you can break these metrics into sequential and random performance. Sequential speeds tend to matter more with portable SSDs, since most people use them to save or access long, constant streams of data such as a bunch of high-res photos. Random speeds would be important if you want to run video games or apps off the drive, since that’d involve reading and writing smaller, more scattered files. Either way, how well an SSD can sustain its performance with extended use is also critical.\nOther performance factors and enclosures\nA modern portable SSD’s speeds aren’t just about its USB interface, though. Its performance can also depend on how advanced its controller is, whether it has a native USB flash controller or a separate bridge chip to communicate with a host device, the kind and quality of NAND flash memory it uses, whether it has a DRAM cache or it’s DRAM-less, and more.\nWe’re simplifying things, but here are some quick tips: Drives with triple-level cell (TLC) memory aren’t as cheap as quad-level cell (QLC) SSDs, but they’re generally more reliable and they offer better write performance. Having a dedicated DRAM cache helps if you plan to hit your drive with more intense, sustained workloads, but may not be worth the extra cost for most people. Some models with native flash controllers may not perform as well as those with a bridging chip, depending on the SSD inside, but they typically draw less heat and are physically smaller. All of this is to say that an external SSD’s speeds aren’t quite as straightforward as what the manufacturer chooses to advertise on the box.\nIt’s also worth remembering that you can turn an internal SSD into a portable solution with a good enclosure. If you have a spare drive and don’t mind going the DIY route, this can be a cheaper and more flexible solution, though we’ve stuck to pre-built models for this guide for the sake of simplicity.\n\n\n\n\n   Photo by Jeff Dunn / Engadget \n \n\nSize, durability, endurance and warranty\nMost portable SSDs are impressively small and light, so they won’t be difficult to tuck in a bag (or even a pocket) and take on the go. We note above if any drive is bulkier than usual.\nNothing we’re talking about matters if your drive can’t last in the long term. It’s hard to definitively say which external SSDs are the most reliable, but we scoured through user reviews and feedback while researching this guide to ensure none of our picks show a pattern of catastrophic errors. If there was too much smoke around a particular model, we steered clear. We ruled out certain drives from SanDisk and Western Digital, for instance, after reports from Ars Technica and The Verge noted an issue that led to data loss (and lawsuits) in 2023.\nThat said, one of the big reasons you’d buy an SSD in general is its superior durability. Because it has no moving mechanical parts inside, an SSD has far fewer avenues to failure than an external hard drive. You still don’t want to be careless with them, but an accidental drop shouldn’t be the end of the world.\nSome portable SSDs build on this inherent ruggedness with plastic or rubberized casings and more robust waterproofing. These aren’t necessary for everyone, but if you’re a frequent traveler or someone who often works outdoors, there are options for you.\nStill, all drives can fail. If you have any sort of data you’d be distraught to lose, you should back it up regularly, then make a second backup, ideally with a cloud service. Along those protective lines, we also took note of the warranty policy for each drive we tested. Just about all of them are backed for either three or five years; of course, longer is better.\nEncryption and software\nIt’s not uncommon to store sensitive data on a portable SSD, so some models offer extra security features like hardware-based encryption — i.e., direct scrambling of data stored on the drive itself — built-in keypads and fingerprint readers to protect against unauthorized access if the drive is lost or stolen. While not top requirements, perks like these are certainly good to have. Some SSDs also come with companion software to further manage the drive. The best of those can be handy to have around, but we wouldn’t call them essential.\nHow we test external SSDs\nUnfortunately, we did not have access to a device that can make full use of USB 3.2 Gen 2, USB 3.2 Gen 2x2 and Thunderbolt/USB4 speeds interchangeably, so we had to split our testing across multiple devices, including an M1 Pro MacBook Pro and an Alienware gaming PC running Windows 11. Because of this, we primarily compared the portable SSDs within each “class” against one another. Before switching OSes, we reformatted each drive to each platform’s standard file system format: APFS for macOS and NTFS for Windows.\nAfter researching which SSDs had enough positive feedback to be worth testing in the first place, we put 13 drives through a range of synthetic and “real-world” benchmark tests. On Windows, these included CrystalDiskMark, PCMark 10’s Data Drive Benchmark and 3DMark’s gaming-focused Storage Benchmark. On macOS, we used AmorphousDiskMark (effectively a Mac version of CrystalDiskMark), BlackMagic Disk Speed Test and ATTO Disk Benchmark.\nWe also timed how long it took for each drive to read and write a custom 70GB folder filled with roughly 11,500 different files, including photos, videos, music files, PDFs and other large and small data types scattered across numerous subfolders. We performed multiple passes for each test to avoid irregularities, and we kept track of each SSD’s heat levels over the course of the whole suite. Our process wasn't a perfect science, but it gave us a general sense of how each drive compares to other models in its price and performance range.\nRecent updates\nFebruary 2025: We’ve checked to ensure the pricing info and links in this guide are still accurate. We’ve also added details on the (relatively) new Thunderbolt 5 interface, which has been implemented in a couple recent portable SSDs like the OWC Envoy Ultra and LaCie Rugged SSD Pro5. We’ll look to include testing notes for those for our next update, as they should be faster than the ADATA SE920, our current premium pick, albeit for a much higher price. For now, though, our top picks remain the same.\nOctober 2024: We’ve taken a sweep through this guide to ensure all pricing and availability info is still correct. Our recommendations are unchanged.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-portable-ssd-120043652.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Welcome to Video Games Weekly on Engadget. Expect a new story every Monday or Tuesday, broken into two parts. The first is a space for short essays and ramblings about video game trends and related topics from me, Jess Conditt, a reporter who's covered the industry for more than 13 years. The second contains the video game stories from the past week that you need to know about, including some headlines from outside of Engadget.\nPlease enjoy — and I'll see you next week.\n\nThis week, I’m fried. Maybe it’s the plodding and ever-present crumbling of society and human decency, or maybe it’s because Love Island USA just ended so I’m feeling extra listless. It’s a familiar summer sensation, but this year everything is exaggerated and extra tense, the stakes of every action seem higher, and instead of melting into the warmth of the season with a popsicle and a smile, I often find myself frozen and numb. I am the popsicle, coo coo ca choo.\nI’m not sure exactly what I’m trying to convey here, but I think it’s clear that I shouldn’t be writing anything too serious at the moment. I’m working on a few reports and trying to keep my composure amid the chaos, and all the while, the video game headlines keep rolling on. I’ve included a few more than usual this week, as penance for my popsicle state.\n\nThe news\nThe Chinese Room escapes from Tencent\nUK studio The Chinese Room, creator of Still Wakes the Deep and Everybody’s Gone to the Rapture, is independent once again. The Chinese Room leaders completed a management buyout with help from VC firm Hiro Capital to fully split the studio from Tencent subsidiary Sumo Digital, which acquired it in 2018. A number of people were laid off as part of the transition and the studio is left with a total of 55 employees. The Chinese Room is still working on Vampire: The Masquerade — Bloodlines 2 for Paradox Interactive, and it also has original projects in development.\nStill Wakes the Deep was one of my absolute favorite games of 2024. Whether you’re a fan of beautiful paranormal horror or you're just really into oil rigs, give it a go.\nRead these stories that Vice censored\nVice’s owner, Savage Ventures, doesn’t want you to read this story. Or this one.\nVice removed two articles about Steam’s new ban on certain “adult-only” content and the organization that pushed for the change, Collective Shout, which has the support of prominent anti-pornography groups with conservative religious foundations. The stories were written by contributor Ana Valens, who said the removals were “due to concerns about the controversial subject matter — not journalistic complaints.” Valens has vowed to never write for Vice again and a handful of reporters there have resigned in solidarity.\nCensoring stories about censorship is certainly a choice, Vice.\nSupermassive delays Directive 8020 and shrinks its team\nThe home of Until Dawn and The Dark Pictures Anthology, Supermassive Games, is laying off 36 people, restructuring its team and delaying one of its projects into 2026. A statement from the studio says the decisions were in response to the video game industry’s “challenging and ever-evolving environment.” It’s estimated that Supermassive had more than 300 employees before the layoffs.\nDirective 8020, the fifth installment in the Dark Pictures Anthology, is now due to come out in the first half of 2026, rather than this fall. Honestly, I’m not surprised to hear Supermassive needs more time to work on Directive 8020. I watched Engadget UK bureau chief Mat Smith play the demo at Summer Game Fest in June, and while it looked great, we were both surprised by how short and non-interactive the segment was. He summed up this feeling in his preview with the line, “Finally, I got to play (but only for a few minutes).”\nSupermassive is also working on Little Nightmares III, a series that it took over from Tarsier Studios. Tarsier created Little Nightmares and its sequel, but lost the rights to the IP when the team was acquired by a subsidiary of Embracer Group in 2019. Series publisher Bandai Namco kept the Little Nightmares brand and commissioned Supermassive to build the third game, while Tarsier is working on its own project, Reanimal.\nIt makes sense that Supermassive would prioritize Little Nightmares III in order to fulfill its obligations with Bandai. The game has already been delayed once, and it’s set to hit PC and consoles on October 10.\nFBC: Firebreak is getting less busted\nI still have high hopes for FBC: Firebreak to be the Left 4 Dead revival we’ve always wanted, but fact is, it’s not quite there yet. Remedy Entertainment is aware of this hard truth and has a plan to fix it. The studio laid out its pipeline for making FBC: Firebreak easier to jump into, more fun to play and less confusing overall, with most major changes coming in an update this winter.\nValve is still the best retirement community in game development\nPCGamesN published an interview with Counter-Strike co-creator Minh Le, who left Valve years ago to try out independent development. One sentiment stuck out to me.\n“They didn't force me out or anything,” Le told PCGamesN. “But a part of me kind of regrets it. Looking back, my decision to leave Valve was, financially, kind of a poor decision. If I had stayed with Valve, I would have been able to retire by now.”\nIt’s not presented as an indictment of Valve, but I find it notable that Le describes the studio as a place to retire, rather than a space to innovate and create the next generation of video games. At this rate, Valve will never outrun its reputation as the studio where talented game developers go to die (professionally speaking). \nBut, hey, at least they're not getting laid off en masse. Which, unfortunately, brings us to the next headline.\nYour favorite studio’s favorite studio faces layoffs\nCyberpunk 2077, Sea of Thieves and Dune: Awakening support studio Virtuos is laying off 270 developers, which is about seven percent of its staff. Virtuos is currently best known as the studio behind The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remastered alongside Bethesda, and it has more than 4,000 employees across Asia, Europe and North America. The cuts affect developers in Asia and Europe, with “fewer than 10” in France, where work on Oblivion Remastered was headquartered.\nHeck yeah, there’s gonna be a Hellraiser game\nMake sure to pin this one on your calendar. Saber Interactive is making Clive Barker's Hellraiser: Revival, a first-person, action-survival horror game that features actor Doug Bradley as Pinhead for the first time in nearly 20 years. Barker himself provided input on the story, too. It’s coming to PlayStation 5, PC and Xbox Series X/S, with no release date yet.\n\"The Hellraiser universe is defined by its unflinching exploration of pain, pleasure, and the thin and terrifying line that separates the two,\" a description from Saber Interactive reads. \"That essence is at the heart of our game.\"\n\nAn inside look at the fallout of the Zenimax layoffs\nGame Developer reporter Chris Kerr spoke with a number of employees at Zenimax who are still reeling from the layoffs that Microsoft enacted in early July. The vibes there sound pretty terrible.\n“This carcass of workers that remains is somehow supposed to keep shipping award-winning games,\" one senior QA tester told Kerr. The developer continued, “Microsoft just took everything that could have been great about the culture and collaboration and decimated it. Morale is terrible. It's grotesque. People are stressed. They're crying.”\nXbox cloud play anywhere\nWhen Xbox isn’t firing thousands of employees in one blow, it’s quietly laying the groundwork for the future of video game distribution. An update for Xbox Insiders this week introduces cross-platform cloud support, bringing your cloud library and play history to the Xbox PC app. This means you can access cloud activity on an Xbox console, PC or Windows handheld, and seamlessly play cloud games across devices. This is just how video games are going to work in the coming decades, and it’s interesting to watch our future slowly roll out in blog posts and software updates.\nSubnautica 2 scandal catch-up\nDid you miss all of the mess around Subnautica 2 last week? Or, more accurately, this past month? To quickly summarize, Subnautica publisher Krafton is being sued by the series creators after it fired them and then delayed their game, allegedly sabotaging a $250 million bonus payout due to developers. To not-quickly summarize, see my complete breakdown of the drama.\nMy Melody & Kuromi hits Netflix this week\nI don’t know who else needs a little levity in their life right now, but I certainly do. Thankfully, the stop-motion show My Melody & Kuromi is coming to Netflix on July 24, and there’s already an adorable tie-in music video by LE SSERAFIM to enjoy. Zen out, watch all of the Sanrio sweetness and finally settle the debate: Are you more of a Kuromi or a My Melody?\n\nAdditional reading\n\nKris Holt's weekly indie game roundup\n\n\nHave a tip for Jessica?

I’ve included a few more than usual this week, as penance for my popsicle state. Supermassive is also working on Little Nightmares III, a series that it took over from Tarsier Studios. It makes sense that Supermassive would prioritize Little Nightmares III in order to fulfill its obligations with Bandai. Remedy Entertainment is aware of this hard truth and has a plan to fix it. PCGamesN published an interview with Counter-Strike co-creator Minh Le, who left Valve years ago to try out independent development. It’s not presented as an indictment of Valve, but I find it notable that Le describes the studio as a place to retire, rather than a space to innovate and create the next generation of video games. At this rate, Valve will never outrun its reputation as the studio where talented game developers go to die (professionally speaking). Game Developer reporter Chris Kerr spoke with a number of employees at Zenimax who are still reeling from the layoffs that Microsoft enacted in early July . “This carcass of workers that remains is somehow supposed to keep shipping award-winning games,\" one senior QA tester told Kerr."

It still sells Echo Frames smart glasses, but shuttered its Halo health tracker in 2023. The AI angle of Bee may be of particular interest for Amazon, especially as the company pushes its Alexa+ generative AI assistant. The always-listening aspect of Bee also harkens back to Amazon's privacy debacle of a few years back when it had to address concerns that employees were reviewing conversations recorded by Alexa, including some recorded by accident.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/amazon-is-acquiring-an-ai-wearable-that-listens-to-everything-you-do-221103233.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "The British government has announced plans to move forward with a law that would bar public organizations from paying off ransomware attackers. The proposed legislation would add schools, town councils, National Health Service (NHS) hospitals and critical infrastructure managers to a ban which already applies to the national government.\nThe logic behind banning payments is simple. If cybercriminals know a ransomware attack against a UK school or hospital won't get them paid, they'll look somewhere else for a more lucrative target. Security Minister Dan Jarvis said that the government is \"determined to smash the cyber criminal business model,\" and added that laws in the proposed package will require even private businesses to seek guidance from the government before paying a ransom.\nSince the WannaCry attack on the NHS in 2017 launched the modern era of ransomware attacks, the UK has suffered a number of serious incidents. In the last two years alone, attacks have hit the British Library, the BBC and the Ministry of Defence. This may explain why, according to the government's announcement, \"nearly three quarters\" of public comments on the ban legislation were supportive.\nAlthough bans on ransom payments are a popular solution to the ever-increasing scourge of ransomware, there's currently not much data on whether they work. Two US states, North Carolina and Florida, have enacted similar bans, but it's hard to say what impact they've had. Critics argue that some organizations, especially hospitals, can't afford the long-term disruption of leaving the ransom unpaid, and may choose to pay in unaccountable ways. Furthermore, some hacking groups have aims other than money, and may continue ransomware attacks to sow political chaos.\nThe UK is moving into uncharted territory as the first nation to pass a ransomware payment ban. We'll be interested to see whether it helps get attacks under control. Either way, the outcome is likely to inform how other countries respond to the continuing threat of cybercrime.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/new-uk-law-would-ban-ransomware-payments-by-publicly-funded-orgs-210851334.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Meta is no longer paying creators to post on Threads. The company quietly ended the Threads bonus program, which offered some creators thousands of dollars a month in bonuses, earlier this year, Engadget has confirmed.\nThe company hasn't officially commented on why it stopped the payments, but an Instagram support page that once listed details about the creator incentives no longer references Threads at all. In posts on Threads, creators who were once part of the program have said they stopped receiving payments around the end of April. That's roughly one year after Meta first started paying creators for popular posts. Though Meta never publicly shared a lot of details about how the program worked, creators who previously spoke with Engadget reported that they were able to earn monthly bonuses ranging from $500 to $5,000 in exchange for hitting specific metrics around post counts and views.\nIt's not clear what Meta's strategy for creators on Threads is going forward. The company is still trying to lure more brands and notable faces to the platform, and has tested features to help people find popular creators they previously followed on X. Meta has also added creator-friendly tools, like the ability to add more links to profiles and more detailed analytics for the app.\nBut Meta has yet to clearly explain what it can offer creators in return. The platform is hardly driving any traffic to outside websites. It's also much harder to build a following on Threads, since the platform defaults to an algorithmic timeline consisting mainly of recommended content. This means that it's easier for a post from an unknown account to go viral, but viral posts rarely lead to an influx of new followers.\nMeta may simply be calculating that Threads already has enough momentum without paying people for viral content. At the same time, Mark Zuckerberg has repeatedly said he believes the app can be Meta's next billion-user platform. It's difficult to see how that happens without the buy-in of creators.\nHave a tip for Karissa?

    "summary": "Gamers aren't usually known for their sartorial elegance. But that doesn't mean we don't deserve nice things. So after checking out a very utilitarian carrying case for the Switch 2, I wanted to explore the other side of things with a more lavish travel bag. And while Waterfield's Magnetic case for Nintendo's latest console certainly isn't the most rugged or affordable way to lug a handheld console around, it might just be the most luxurious.\nDesign: Drape me in this leather\nCompared to most Switch 2 travel bags that are made out of materials like plastic and polyester, Waterfield's case is an exercise in opulence. It's crafted from buttery full-grain leather that's softer than than a perfectly worn in baseball mitt or fancy Dior gloves. It really is that nice. \n \nI've been using the white leather model as I love how clean and simple it looks while still giving you that irresistible pillowy exterior. But for the kind of folk who get excited about patina, the chocolate model features a more distressed look that isn't afraid to show off oil, scuffs and blemishes. And if the need arises, you can always hit the case with hot air from a hair dryer to reduce the appearance of scratches.\nBut the thing that sets Waterfield's case apart from its competition is that instead of relying on a zipper, the pouch has a series of magnets to keep everything together. And honestly, there's just something really nice about not having any sharp objects near or around the case, so there's no fear of your Switch 2 getting nicked. This enclosure system also makes it super simple to thread a cable inside, allowing you to charge Nintendo's latest handheld without it needing to leave the safety of its case. On a practical level, I've also found that because taking the console in and out is so quick and easy, I'm much better about putting things back when I'm done gaming.\nThe obvious downside to this is that it's easier for stuff like sand to get inside and if you're storing tiny accessories like a microSD Express card, there's no real guarantee it won't fall out while you're in transit. Additionally, the trade-off for the case's fancy leather exterior is that it doesn't have the hard, rigid panels used in a lot of competitors, so it's not the most rugged travel companion. If you press down on the outside of the case, you can feel things like console's buttons and joysticks, so this definitely isn't something you'll want to cram into an already stuffed piece of luggage.\nOn the inside, Waterfield's case is lined with a plush microfiber fabric that will keep the Switch 2 nice and cozy. There are also two pockets for stashing small items like charging cables, game cartridges or Joy-Con straps. But I do mean small, because anything larger will cause the case to bulge, which may put undue stress on the console.\nOptional accessories\n\n\n\n\n   Sam Rutherford for Engadget \n \n\nThis case doesn't come with much in the way of bundled extras. Though like a lot of luxury products (just look at the options list on a Porsche or Ferrari), you can purchase additional accessories such as cord clips, AirTag holders and more. But the most important of these are Waterfield's game card holders, which are available in several sizes (4, 10 and 20). So I went and bought a 10-slot sleeve and it really is the perfect complement to the case. Cartridges fit snug and the holder itself nestles neatly into the pouch's built-in pockets. I just wish one came included, as you're looking at an extra $10 to $30 on top of an already pricey travel protector.\nWrap-up\nStarting at $90 for the nylon or waxed canvas models or $120 for the leather versions, Waterfield's Magnetic Case for the Switch 2 certainly ain't cheap. That's more expensive than Belkin's Charging Case, which comes with its own battery pack. And that's before you factor in a game card holder.\n\n\n\n\n   Sam Rutherford for Engadget \n \n\nBut the sheer suppleness of its leather and its super soft interior might be the comfiest cocoon Nintendo's handheld will ever experience. Then you add in a magnetic enclosure system and it feels like Waterfield has managed to transform a product that might normally be an afterthought into something that's a joy to use all by itself. So for those who want a travel pouch that looks and feels just as good as the console it's protecting (if not better), this case is in a class of its own.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/waterfield-magnetic-case-review-the-most-lavish-way-to-carry-your-switch-2-around-200052731.html?src=rss",
