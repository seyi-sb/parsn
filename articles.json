The results were not as positive for those at high risk or who already had heart disease. Vitamin E's contribution to free radical reduction also reduces skin damage from UV exposure. Less skin damage means a more youthful glow, and who doesn't want that? Its anti-inflammatory effects also help to reduce symptoms in chronic inflammatory skin conditions like dermatitis. Although there is no research to suggest vitamin E causes heart disease, some research does suggest that vitamin E may worsen the condition and increase the risk of death by heart attack or stroke.

Some said the other models seemed more friendly and conversational than GPT-5. \"BRING BACK 4o,\" one user posted, \"GPT-5 is wearing the skin of my dead friend.\" Altman, posting in the AMA, said OpenAI will look into making 4o or other models available for Plus users. Altman said \"we hear you all on 4o\" and that OpenAI will monitor usage to see how long to support 4o for Plus users. The rollout of GPT-5 was \"a little more bumpy than we hoped for,\" Altman said. The program that decides whether a prompt will be handled by a faster, lighter model within GPT-5 or a more intensive reasoning model was not working for part of Thursday, he said.

    "full_text": "In the hearing, he also cited that his friends had shed pounds and “lost their diabetes diagnosis” thanks to devices like continuous glucose monitors (CGMs). But the way these products and their apps are designed, I didn’t know how to “take control” of my health. What I haven’t shared quite as publicly is that these improvements came at a heavy cost to my mental health. According to my therapist, I had begun showing mild signs of both orthorexia nervosa and anorexia. Food logging is often a prominent feature in wearable apps, like with the Oura Ring. It can be helpful, but there was a time where I’d never allow myself to enjoy this type of meal. Most of these messages come from people who have had a recent health scare, and I usually spend the next hour teaching them how to interpret their baseline data in less absolute terms. These devices overloaded the people in my life with too much information but not enough context. How can anyone effectively “take control of their health” if they’re struggling to understand it? But even if Kennedy were to solve this logistical nightmare, I take issue with framing wearables as a necessary component in anyone’s health journey."

    "full_text": "A few years ago I had some pain on the top right side of my right foot that wouldn't go away so I went to a podiatrist to get it checked out. He said it was nothing serious and suggested I purchase a pair of Oofos recovery slides and not only wear them instead of my shoes as much as possible but wear them inside my apartment instead of going barefoot. I like the Oofos -- and they indeed helped cure my foot problem -- but I recently tried a new pair of slides from Oka Recovery that are slightly better. Judging from some comments online, I'm not the only one who's experienced this. Oka says its recovery slides have 35mm of \"buoyant foam,\" 12 cooling vents and \"a wide upper that cradles without squeezing.\" I'm usually a size 10 but the review sample that fit me well was the men's 9/women's 11 (yes, they're unisex). Slip-on recovery clogs are also a good option -- I just tried a pair from Bogs -- but the Oka slides remain my current favorites as far as recovery footwear goes. Although Crocs recovery slides cost closer to $30, most of these premium recovery slides tend to cost about $50 and pretty much everything Oka sells, whether it's slides or flip-flops, costs $50. While Oka's footwear doesn't seem to go on sale, it should be tariff-proof because all of its products are made in the US out of 100% recycled material. While the Oka Recovery footwear brand only launched in February, the company has been around since 1984 making shoes for \"the brands you know and love\" along with its own shoe brands, which include Okabashi and Oka-B."

In Is This Seat Taken?, your goal is to place people who are tiny geometric shapes into the right seat that meets their needs. When you place that triangle by the window, they’ll be happy. But drop a smelly square nearby and the triangle will get mad until you find them a better spot or move the square somewhere else. With limited seats and various needs to take into account, the stages can quickly become pretty tricky. Fortunately, the game does a lot to make sure there isn’t too much pressure involved. The shapes are quite charming, which helps me from getting too annoyed with them even if they’re particularly difficult to seat. And if you don’t find a way to make everybody happy, the only “penalty” is that you won’t get enough points to get the gold stars used to unlock secret levels.

No hookups for electricity or water meant we needed to bring our own power. This Govee portable Bluetooth speaker / lamp with a built-in battery was very handy when we had to switch off the power.

    "full_text": "I’d throw a couple of logs on the fire and settle in for a full slate of Sunday NFL programming without needing to decipher how to watch the games I wanted to watch. These days, it seems like there are dozens of available options for streaming NFL games, with things getting increasingly complicated every year as additional streaming services enter the fray to secure exclusive rights to high-profile matchups. Two brand-new streaming services from Fox and ESPN joined the lineup this year, giving you even more ways to stream NFL games this season. It takes a lot to watch the NFL in 2025, but using a VPN to stream NFL games can help maximize your streaming capabilities and get you access to even more matchups by routing your internet connection through a different location. Depending on what streaming service you use to watch NFL games, you may only have access to out-of-market matchups or you may only have access to the matchups available on your local network stations. Because a VPN can make it look like you’re using the internet in a different region, your NFL streaming options aren’t limited by your physical location, so you can theoretically watch any live NFL game you want when connected to a VPN. So whether you’re managing multiple fantasy football teams, wagering on the action, avoiding TV blackouts, streaming your home team from abroad or just a casual fan who likes to watch a ton of football, a VPN is a useful addition to your digital toolbox. Not all VPNs perform equally when it comes to streaming -- whether that's NFL games or movies and shows. Based on my decade of experience using, testing and researching VPNs, I recommend using one of the VPNs listed above for streaming NFL games because of each provider's excellent unblocking capabilities and superb performance across operating systems and streaming devices. Just remember to check the terms of service for any streaming service to make sure location-changing isn’t a violation of its terms."

However, Alien: Earth introduces a few new concepts to the mix: Cyborgs (humans augmented with machine parts), hybrids (synthetic bodies controlled by human consciousness) and a collection of insidious space insects that add new horrors besides the face-hugging variety. Sure, a chest-bursting sequence in an Alien movie can be unsettling to watch. Babou Ceesay plays Morrow, a cyborg security officer employed by Weyland-Yutani in Alien: Earth. Audiences have never seen Olyphant play a character like the synthetic Kirsh. She is also an advanced synthetic human infused with the consciousness of a child.

Many of the best VPNs are also rolling out post-quantum protections that help protect against potential future threats from quantum computers, which is essential for privacy-critical users now and in the future. Finally, your provider should offer either a RAM-only server infrastructure or employ full-disk encryption on its hard drives, both of which can help ensure that your data remains secure. Generally, we've found that the best VPNs for iPhone only drop your internet download speed by an average of 25% or less. For bandwidth-demanding applications like competitive gaming or video streaming, you'll want a fast VPN. A good VPN for iPhone should run smoothly and be easy to use, regardless of your technical expertise. For instance, if you're in New York City but connected to a server in the UK, apps like Netflix will think you're across the pond. Luckily, there are plenty of ways to save money on your VPN subscription. (Disclosure: IPVanish is owned by the same parent company as CNET, Ziff Davis.)"

In April, analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said the iPhone 17 Air and Pro models would sport 12GB of RAM but that Apple was still deciding whether to equip the baseline model with that higher amount too. In May, analyst Jeff Pu noted the baseline would remain at 8GB. That should help to stretch your battery life on either device. So any shiny new capabilities will likely land on its more premium phones first, such as the rumored antireflective display and redesigned cameras on the iPhone 17 Pro models."

Apple introduced Live Stickers in iOS 17 as an evolution of the tap-and-lift feature from iOS 16, which lets you cut out subjects from photos and Live Photos. Tap the photo you want to turn into an emoji or sticker. Make sure you select the folded-over circle (selected above) to view your new emoji. If you tap the new sticker, you'll be given the options to Rearrange, Add Effect or Delete it. Tapping Add Effect will let you add an effect to your sticker, like a white outline, to make it look even more like a sticker. I tried to use my Live Stickers on the messaging app Slack, but they wouldn't appear in the app. I also couldn't access my Live Stickers in some third-party apps, like TikTok, so you might run into some issues when using your Live Stickers outside of Apple apps and devices. For more on iOS, here are my first impressions of the iOS 26 beta, how to enable call screening in the beta and all the other new features Apple said that update will bring to your device later this year."

Here’s an example of the most common scheme we’ve been tracking: Impostors impersonating our reporters to extract sensitive business information from unsuspecting targets. In several cases we know about, scammers have adopted the identity of actual staff members, crafting what looks like a standard media inquiry about a company’s products and requesting an introductory call. But these schemes evolve quickly; bad actors keep refining their tactics, mimicking reporters’ writing styles and referencing startup trends to make their pitches increasingly convincing. As for what to do about it, if someone reaches out claiming to be from TechCrunch and you have even the slightest doubt about whether they’re legitimate, please don’t just take their word for it. We’ve made it easy for you to verify. If you do see someone’s name on our staff page, but our employee’s job description doesn’t square with the request you are receiving (i.e., a TechCrunch copy editor is suddenly very interested in learning about your business! ), a bad actor may be trying to con you. If it sounds like a legitimate request but you want to make doubly certain, you should also feel free to contact us directly and just ask.

For months, ChatGPT fans have been waiting for the launch of GPT-5, which OpenAI says comes with major improvements to writing and coding capabilities over its predecessors.

As part of GPT-5’s launch, OpenAI removed the model picker from ChatGPT. This dropdown menu previously housed a cluster of OpenAI’s confusingly-named models, allowing users to swap between them for different purposes. “Now it’s just gone, feels like someone died.” Another user called upon other members of the r/ChatGPT subreddit to contact OpenAI if they “miss” GPT-4o. People using ChatGPT for emotional support weren’t the only ones complaining about GPT-5. But many users on the r/ChatGPT subreddit said that the chatbot’s responses were slower, shorter, and less accurate when compared to previous versions. It’s not uncommon for chatbot updates to at least temporarily alienate users with their changes, or for people to mourn old models; one group of fans even recently held a funeral to mark the retirement of Anthropic’s Claude 3 Sonnet."

These aren’t the only signs of AI Wikipedians are looking out for, though. The speedy deletion policy isn’t just for AI-generated slop content, either. The Wikimedia Foundation is also actively developing a non-AI-powered tool called Edit Check that’s geared toward helping new contributors fall in line with its policies and writing guidelines. Right now, Edit Check can remind writers to add citations if they’ve written a large amount of text without one, as well as check their tone to ensure that writers stay neutral. The Wikimedia Foundation is also working on adding a “Paste Check” to the tool, which will ask users who’ve pasted a large chunk of text into an article whether they’ve actually written it. Contributors have submitted several ideas to help the Wikimedia Foundation build upon the tool as well, with one user suggesting asking suspected AI authors to specify how much was generated by a chatbot. “For now, our focus with using machine learning in the editing context is more on helping people make constructive edits, and also on helping people who are patrolling edits pay attention to the right ones.”"

Cruley was vague about whether Google intends to pursue regulatory clearance to take this type of medical assistant into doctor’s offices here on Earth, but it could be an obvious next step if the model is validated on orbit."

    "full_text": "Following Wednesday’s launch of Instagram’s new Snap Map-like opt-in “Instagram Map” feature — which lets U.S. users share their most recent active location with others and discover location-based content — Instagram head Adam Mosseri is having to reassure people that their location is only visible to others if they decide to share it. Although Meta has made it clear that location sharing is off by default, there have been numerous posts on social media urging users to turn off location sharing, incorrectly claiming that it’s automatically turned on. Mosseri also said that some people are “confused” about how the feature works. It’s worth noting that this isn’t new, as Instagram already had location tags visible to users in its map view. However, the new Instagram Map feature makes this information a lot easier to access. If you turn on your location on Instagram Map, your location only updates when you open the app or have it running in the background, meaning it doesn’t provide continuous, real-time location updates. This is different from Snap Map, which lets users choose whether their location is updated only when they open the app or in real time. For those who want to ensure their location is turned off on Instagram Map, we’ll walk you through the steps below. If it’s your first time accessing the feature, you’ll likely see a pop-up message notifying you about the new Map. Here, you will be able to change your settings."

The discussion also omitted mention of mass user bans, which users believe stem from an overreliance on poorly designed AI moderation systems. On the call, Ready also spoke about how Pinterest aims to compete in the war for AI talent, saying that people who want to work there care about AI that’s used for good and used “responsibly.” “Both in terms of what we’re doing with tuning AI for positivity, creating a more positive alternative to what’s happening in the rest of social media,” he said."

Monarch CEO Praveen Penmetsa has not responded to emailed requests for comment. SoftBank, OpenAI, and Oracle announced the Stargate project one day after Donald Trump’s inauguration. The effort currently involves a large data center that is being built in Texas, but the companies involved have said they want to build infrastructure in other states and countries. In May, Bloomberg reported that SoftBank was struggling to line up funding for the project and that it was already being hampered by Trump’s myriad trade wars. Foxconn bought the factory in late 2021 from electric vehicle startup Lordstown Motors. At the time, Foxconn chairman Young Liu said his company wanted to develop the site into the “most important electric vehicle manufacturing and R&D hub in North America.” Prospective customers like Fisker Inc. and California startup IndiEV also went out of business."

While at OpenAI, Conneau co-created GPT4-o Advanced Voice Mode neural networks. TechCrunch has reached out to WaveForms to find out whether its chief technologist, Kartikay Khandelwal, will also join Meta, as well as the outcome of the deal for the roughly 14 other staffers (per LinkedIn) at the company. WaveForms appears to have taken down its own website, but the company’s LinkedIn page describes its mission as solving the “Speech Turing Test,” which tries to measure if a listener can distinguish between human and AI-generated speech. WaveForms was also developing “Emotional General Intelligence,” which focuses on understanding individual self-awareness and management.

As for the new charting tools, Google says these “will help you visualize financial data beyond simple asset performance. You can view technical indicators, like moving average envelopes, or adjust the display to see candlestick charts and more.” Google Finance is also getting additional market data, including commodities and additional cryptocurrencies. Additionally, there’s a new live news feed that lets you see real-time headlines. With this update, Google is looking to take on platforms like Yahoo Finance and Seeking Alpha.

    "full_text": "That deal didn’t happen, according to a source familiar with the matter. Insiders tell TechCrunch that for all the popularity and hype around AI coding assistants, they can actually be massively money-losing businesses.

    "summary": "The EU has authorized Brex to sell its spend management products directly in all 30 countries, \"no workarounds required,\" CEO Pedro Franceschi said.",
    "full_text": "That means it can now directly issue credit and debit cards and offer its spend management products to any business in all 30 EU countries with “no workarounds required,” as co-founder and CEO Pedro Franceschi wrote in a blog post. While the corporate spend management startup previously supported 60 currencies in 200 countries, it could only sell its products to companies with a U.S. presence. With the expansion, Brex is now authorized to sell spend management (complete with issuing cards) and other tools like embedded payments to EU companies and startups, a spokesperson tells TechCrunch. However, there’s a caveat: Banking and bill pay will not be initially available. Brex’s claim to fame is offering startups expense management cards for their employees even if they wouldn’t yet qualify from traditional banks. Without a bank account offering, the youngest EU startups will still have to weigh their options. That’s quite the turnaround from a shaky moment in 2023 when Brex conducted layoffs and reportedly told employees that its cash burn was too high. There has been no hint yet as to when that IPO may take place, though. Brex’s competitive win in the international market comes as its U.S. fintech competitors are having an overall moment. Brex has not publicly announced new equity VC funding since 2022, when it raised $300 million in a Series D-2 round at a $12.3 billion valuation."

Starbase disagrees: In July, Starbase city administrator Kent Myers reportedly sent a letter to a Cameron County commissioner saying the abrupt water cutoff “poses safety and public health risks.” There were 247 lots inside that boundary, and only 10 were not owned by SpaceX, according to an affidavit submitted by SpaceX senior manager of spaceport operations Richard Cardile. “These services are provided by SpaceX within the City Limits.” The planned pipeline solves near-term scarcity for SpaceX employees and their families but doesn’t create a public right to water."
