    "summary": "August is more than half over, which means we're getting ever closer to the usual September timeframe of Apple's iPhone event. That means the expected official announcement of the iPhone 17 line. The latest iOS 26 features will come preinstalled on the new models, as well as any additional features Apple reveals at the launch event. But since we still have to wait a few weeks (presumably) until the iPhone event, we can at least speculate what the new phones will look like. As with most unreleased iPhone models, rumors and leaks have trickled in about the hardware side ahead of the official introduction. Here's what we're expecting and what we can reasonably assume we'll get from Cupertino in September.\nWhat are the latest iPhone 17 rumors?\nThe latest rumor from a Weibo leaker known as Digital Chat Station suggests the iPhone 17e will come equipped with a new design that includes the Dynamic Island, MacRumors reports. According to the post, the new phone will have the A19 chip and could have a 6.1-inch OLED display with a front-facing 12-megapixel camera and a rear-facing 48-megapixel camera.¬†\nIn additional to the usual caveat ‚Äî this is just a rumor and we won't know what the actual iPhone 17 models look like until Apple's iPhone event next month ‚Äî there's a second important distinction here. This report refers to the 17e model that would be expected to launch no earlier than February 2026, if it followed the same release pattern as the iPhone 16e.\nHow much will the iPhone 17 cost?\nApple's announced plan to expand US-based manufacturing partners seems to give it at least some shielding from the steepest Trump administration tariffs that have already triggered price increases on everything from Switch consoles to high-end cameras to Sonos speakers. But given that President Trump's trade policies can change from week to week, and Apple's continuing reliance on Asia-based supply chains, price shocks remain an ongoing possibility. The bigger question is: Will Apple absorb any higher costs, or pass them on to consumers?¬†\nIf prices do creep up, Apple may choose to pair it with an \"upgrade.\" Consider this recent rumor posted by MacRumors¬†from a leaker known as \"Instant Digital,\" suggesting that the default storage of the iPhone 17 line may start at 256GB, doubling the current 128GB baseline. While that could be accompanied by a price increase of $50, Apple could at least pitch it as a \"better value.\" That said, the company doubled the default RAM of its Mac computers from 8GB to 16GB at no extra cost in 2024 ‚Äî but that was before the current Trump tariff cycle started.\nWhen will the iPhone 17 series be announced?\nMost years, the flagship smartphones are introduced in September. MacRumors highlighted a story originally reported by iphone-ticker.de that the Apple iPhone 17 event could be Tuesday, September 9, according to information gleaned from German mobile phone providers.\nIt's still too early to have the specific dates; some years, Apple only gives a week or two of lead time between sending invites and hosting the event. But years of past precedent show that sometime in September should be when the 17 models make their debut. This family of smartphones may be the last to follow that trend, however. There have been hints that the introduction of the iPhone 18 collection in 2026 will be split into a pro-tier announcement in the fall and a standard model announcement the following spring.\nWhat will the new iPhone 17 lineup include?\nDesign leaks suggest that Apple is building an ultra-thin smartphone, likely to be named the iPhone 17 Air to match Apple's ultralight laptop designation. Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, often a solid source of advanced intel about Apple, reported in January that the iPhone 17 Air will be equipped with a basic A19 chip and will only have a single camera lens. It may also use Apple's new in-house modem, which was introduced in February on the iPhone 16e. More details about this development may leak ahead of September, but that's what we know for now.\nAn investor note from Apple analyst Jeff Pu indicated that the Air will have a titanium frame. If his reports are accurate, the lightweight smartphone will be the only entry in the iPhone 17 lineup to use that metal; the iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone 17 Pro Max are expected to be made of aluminum, which is oddly a lighter material than titanium. Other speculation had suggested that the Air would use a blend of aluminum and titanium, so the exact materials may not be known until the official announcement.\nAdditionally, an August 4 MacRumors report says the internal battery pack of the iPhone Air is just 2.49mm thick ‚Äî half the thickness of the iPhone 17 Pro battery. The leak was posted on the Korean-language Naver blog, where they show the alleged batteries of the iPhone 17 Air and 17 Pro side by side. The same account claimed the 17 Air's battery capacity was a mere 2,800 mAh, MacRumors notes. (That's below the battery capacity of current iPhone 16 models.)\nOn a similar topic, an iPhone 17 Pro production leak appears to have revealed an all-aluminum chassis, according to MacRumors. Originally posted by leaker Majin Bu, the image shows a shell that has a large round hole on the back (where the Apple logo typically is) to allow for MagSafe charging. MacRumors says this could just be a molding but notes that the aluminum frame (versus the current titanium in Pro iPhone models) would yield a significantly lower weight.\nThat same leaker (Majin Bu), whom MacRumors classifies as a \"hit-or-miss leaker,\" suggests the iPhone 17 Pro will have better wireless signal strength thanks to an updated antenna design. The individual posted a render on X that shows a new antenna system that wraps around the iPhone 17 Pro's supposedly wider rear camera bump. Again, this is a render, not a real-world photo. That said, we can't knock the goal of better wireless reception, so we're hoping this one has a degree of truth to it.\nEach new roster includes a base model, but over the years, Apple has shaken up the variety of phones it offers. Most likely there will be an iPhone 17 and an iPhone 17 Pro. Apple has also committed to the size matters philosophy, and has been building an iPhone Pro Max option with an even bigger screen and better battery life; the 17 roster will almost certainly have one as well.¬†\nThe new Pro iPhones are said to have a full-width \"camera island\" on the rear, which would mark the first time an Apple model opted for that design. This feature can be seen in the purported iPhone 17 \"spotted in the wild.\" The pics, highlighted on MacRumors, show a black cased iPhone (17 Pro?) with the distinct back panel. Is it the real deal? The dual angles lend a degree of credibility in a social media landscape increasingly polluted with AI-enhanced fakes, but your guess is as good as ours.\nI just spotted a test development iPhone in the wild ü§©ü§©ü§© pic.twitter.com/iS3PtKWqxJ‚Äî Fox Pupy ü¶äüß° (@Skyfops) July 28, 2025\n\nThe iPhone 17 Air seems primed to take the place of a potential iPhone 17 Plus. Since the iPhone 16e was only just introduced in February at a surprisingly high price point, it seems unlikely that there will be a new addition to that lower end of the spectrum, the models that were previously called SE.¬†\nAt the very least, it sounds like the iPhone 17 Air won't take away the charging port and rely only on wireless connectivity. Bloomberg said that while Apple had investigated making the iPhone 17 Air without a single port, the company (fortunately) changed plans. He also says that the rumored phone will have a 6.6-inch screen and include the Dynamic Island and Camera Control button. Finally, the price is rumored at $900 ‚Äî likely more than the standard iPhone 17 but less than the Pro.\nWe've also gotten what seems to be a reliable look at what the color lineup will be for the new smartphones. Macworld reported that the iPhone 17 will be available in black, white, steel gray, green, purple and light blue. The iPhone 17 Air will reportedly have four color options: black, white, light blue and light gold. While the Air colors will be less saturated, the visuals for the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max will go bold. The options for the Pro models are expected to be black, white, gray, dark blue and orange.\nOn July 30, Tom's Guide highlighted an X post from Sonny Dickson ‚Äî a longtime and generally reliable leaker of unreleased iPhone information ‚Äî showing \"dummy\" iPhone 17 models in the new colors that were the source of the aforementioned Macworld story. While these are literally just mock-ups ‚Äî not real, leaked iPhones ‚Äî it's interesting to see how the design and color rumors translate into a real-world look and feel.\nWhat will iOS 26 be like?\nApple upended its numbering conventions with WWDC 2025, and will match the name of each new operating system to the year it's released. So when the next wave of iPhones hits, they'll be running on iOS 26.\nOn the design side, the smartphone OS introduced during the big developer showcase took a contentious approach dubbed Liquid Glass. Apple has been scaling down the amount of transparency effects in the subsequent beta tests of iOS 26, but it will still have a glass-like visual.\nThe feature list includes big and small updates. On the more impactful side, the Phone and Photos apps have been redesigned. There will be several features leveraging artificial intelligence, such as live translation capabilities coming to Phone, FaceTime and Messages. Apple is also currently testing a sensitive content warning for child accounts that will freeze FaceTime video if nudity is detected by on-device machine learning tools. And the company is also launching Visual Intelligence, which will use AI to search for elements in an image.\niOS 26 also has a litany of minor, quality of life improvements. Group texts are getting support for polls. And for the slow risers out there, iOS 26 will finally let you escape the tyranny of the nine minute snooze alarm.¬†\nThe next iOS is now available as a public beta. Here are our initial impressions of the Liquid Glass design and other new features. iOS 26 is compatible with all models back through iPhone 11.\nWhat other products are expected to be released alongside the iPhone 17?\nIf Apple follows its usual pattern, the iPhone 17 will be announced alongside new Apple Watch products. That would be the Apple Watch Series 11 (if Apple sticks to the same naming scheme), and maybe an Apple Watch Ultra 3 and/or an updated Apple Watch SE. (They'll all run watchOS 26, of course.) Other possibilities ‚Äî and this is, again, speculation ‚Äî could include refreshed Apple AirPods Pro (which received its last big update in 2022) and maybe new AirTags trackers (first released in 2021).\nThe Apple rumor mill got a big shot in the arm this week thanks to the reported inclusion of product ID numbers in recent beta software builds. Per MacRumors, it's a laundry list of new hardware, including long-rumored product updates like the Apple TV, HomePod mini, new Apple Studio Display monitor and two fresh iPads.¬†\nOf course, even if that list is totally accurate, we may not see those products until 2026 ‚Äî if ever. So don't expect all of products to share the stage with the iPhone 17, especially since Apple likes to keep its star performer at the center of attention.¬†\nThat said, keep in mind that Apple has recently been having Mac-centric announcements in late October (as it did last year to debut new M4 Macs), so there's always the chance of another shoe dropping a few weeks down the road.¬†¬†\nUpdate, August 18, 2025, : Added new rumor about the iPhone 17e potentially having the Dynamic Island.\nUpdate, August 15, 2025, 2:05PM ET: Added new rumor about the all-aluminum chassis on the iPhone 17.\nUpdate, August 13, 2025, 10:02PM ET: Added a list of the products that are expected to be released alongside the iPhone 17s.¬†\nUpdate, August 11, 2025, 7:27PM ET: Added a render of a rumored new antenna design for the iPhone 17 Pro.\nUpdate, August 8, 2025, 4:43PM ET: Added new speculation and reports about iPhone 17 pricing.\nUpdate, August 6, 2025, 4:05PM ET: Added latest details about the potential iPhone 17 event date.\nUpdate, August 4, 2025, 5:23PM ET: Added latest battery leaks about the iPhone 17 models.\nUpdate, August 1, 2025, 8:15AM ET: Added new photos showing potential iPhone 17 colors.\nUpdate, July 30, 2025, 11:08AM ET: Added latest leaks and rumors about the iPhone 17, and updated information on the iOS 26 public beta.\nUpdate, July 17, 2025, 4:40PM ET: Added latest information about iOS 26, possible materials for the Air, and the color options for the different models.\nUpdate, March 17, 2025, 2PM ET: Added details about the rumored price and features of the iPhone 17 Air.\nUpdate, April 11, 2025, 3:45PM ET: Added details from Front Page Tech's new video that claims to reveal details from a leaked iOS 19 build.\nKatie Teague contributed to this story.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/apple-iphone-17-air-and-pro-launch-date-is-rumored-for-september-heres-everything-you-need-to-know-153024574.html?src=rss",

    "full_text": "Its main benefit is that, instead of rigid outlets on a flat frame like most surge protectors, it has five short cables with the outlets at the end. Most surge protectors will continue to pass power when they've passed their joule rating, but the D080B-051B has a fail safe, cutting power so your gear is protected against further surges. It's surprising that more surge protectors aren't built like this. Most people probably won't need this specific type of functionality, but I'm sure some of you are looking at it and know exactly how it will fit in your home. Unlike the others on my list, there's no connected device warranty -- meaning the company doesn't have a program to replace your fried devices should it occur. Although with Accell's unique fail-safe, you might not need it. Depending on what you're plugging into it, they might bunch up or not fit against the wall. The Amazon S9P658O300A00 can fit more plugs for a somewhat similar footprint. For something similar but smaller, check out the Belkin BSV300ttCW mentioned below. Its most interesting design feature is a lipped top surface where you can lean your phone while it's charging."

For the uninitiated, the K-index is a measure of how strong geomagnetic storms are and a Kp 5 rating is designated as a \"moderate\" storm by NOAA. This week's geomagnetic storm comes to us courtesy of the sun. Per SpaceWeatherLive, there were a number of solar flares ejected from the sun over the last several days, a pattern of increased solar activity that also caused the aurora on Aug. 8. Most of the states bordering Canada will see a light show. NOAA says the storm will peak at around 0300 to 0900 UTC, which translates to 11 p.m. through 5 a.m. ET (8 p.m. to 2 a.m. PT). If you live in one of the aforementioned states, your best bet is to get somewhere elevated and away from city or suburban light pollution, and then simply point yourself north. If you plan on taking a trip out to the sticks to see it, keep an eye out for shooting stars at the tail end of Perseids meteor shower and you may be able to spot some plants in the last planet parade of 2025."

Here are the BF6 Beta download links for each platform: : An urban battlefield in the heart of Egypt with tight buildings, wide boulevards and ground vehicles. Just like with the maps, each weekend also featured certain game modes. A special note if you haven't played a Battlefield game on PC recently: Studio DICE and EA recently started requiring players to set their computers to Secure Boot when playing Battlefield games to combat cheaters, and Battlefield 6 is no different."

A career experiences immediate transformation after someone receives an Oscar win or even just a nomination,\" says Lee Romaire, a special-effects veteran who worked on Guillermo del Toro's upcoming Frankenstein and who is the founder of Romaire Studios. \"The broadcast maintains its importance because it functions as a worldwide platform for cinematic artistry despite declining box office earnings and award show ratings,\" Romaire says. \"If the Oscars want to stay relevant, meeting viewers where they are makes sense.\" It would also, Romaire says, \"reinforce the reality that the future of entertainment distribution is no longer tied to movie theaters or legacy TV.\" The Academy may also be looking for ways to split up a broadcasting deal among multiple players instead of relying on one entity such as Netflix or YouTube. \"I'd guess that the Academy will find a way -- much as professional sports leagues like the NFL do -- to parcel out rights by platform, so perhaps any streaming element would live alongside a broadcast,\" says Seth Schachner, managing director at Strat Americas, a communications consultancy firm. \"I'd also bet advertising weighs heavily on any decision here as there's a big, if old, advertising ecosystem that big awards shows like the Oscars survive on,\" Schachner says."

Inside the tin is a card with a code you can scan to explore McDonaldland online, an ID card for your particular character, two postcards and four stickers. Honestly, unless McDonald's nostalgia is your thing, I'd recommend you just stick to ordering your usual at the Golden Arches and skipping the meal.

    "summary": "NVIDIA's GeForce NOW game streaming service is leveling-up in September with the addition of RTX 5080 GPUs, which will allow for 5K streaming at up to 120fps (or 1080p/320fps for the truly frame-hungry). While you'll need to be on the $20-a-month GeForce Now Ultimate tier to use RTX 5080 streaming servers,  NVIDIA at least isn't raising that tier's price. Subscribers at that level will still receive 100 hours of monthly playtime (with 15 hours of rollover), up to eight-hour long sessions and access to all of GPU's respective DLSS features, including Frame Generation.\nNVIDIA claims the RTX 5080 GeForce Now servers will perform up to 2.8 times faster than the current RTX 4080 systems ‚Äî but of course, that's due to the new GPU's 4X Frame Gen capabilities, which interpolates frames using AI modeling. The 4080 only supports up to 2X Frame Generation. At launch, GeForce Now's RTX 5080 servers will support popular games like Doom: The Dark Ages, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, Cyberpunk 2077 and Flight Simulator. We're still waiting for a full list of supported titles from NVIDIA, as well updates on when we can expect more games that will support the RTX 5080.\nWhile the raw power of the RTX 5080 will be the main draw for the GeForce NOW Ultimate tier, NVIDIA is also improving something that's always bothered me with game streaming: image quality. No matter the resolution and framerate I've seen while streaming games across multiple services, I've always noticed that the color fidelity and overall sharpness doesn't look as good as rendering a game locally on a PC. NVIDIA's new Cinematic Quality Streaming (CQS) aims to change that, with support for YUV 4:4:4 chroma subsampling (for more accurate colors), smoother video streaming performance with the AV1 codec, and AI video filtering to reduce artifacts. CQS will also be able to automatically detect and optimize its settings for the DPI of your screen ‚Äî that's helpful for high DPI laptop screens.\nWith CQS turned on, GeForce Now streams will max out at a hefty 100Mbps. That'll make it ideal for people with 1Gbps or faster connections, but it could be out of reach if you've got slower internet or restrictive bandwidth caps. I've only seen a screenshot of CQS in action, but it's definitely something I'll be testing further once the new GeForce NOW servers launch in September.\nNVIDIA also plans to expand the number of titles on GeForce NOW with a new feature called Install-to-Play games, which will automatically get installed to cloud storage servers. Performance and Ultimate-tier subscribers will get 100GB of storage for free, and they can upgrade to 200GB for $2.99 monthly, 500GB for $4.99 per month and 1TB for $7.99. Typically, GeForce NOW games are preinstalled on servers and wait for players to queue them up. (It's also worth noting that the service taps into games you've already bought on existing storefronts like Steam, your subscription doesn't get you a collection of games to play like Xbox cloud streaming.)\nNVIDIA says that GeForce Now will have up 2,300 pre-installed games this year, and together with Install-to-Play options there will be over 4,500 games on the service. That goes a long way towards making GeForce Now more appealing to mainstream players ‚Äî if you could play most new titles over the cloud for a monthly fee, why have a gaming PC at all?\nTo that end, NVIDIA is also making GeForce NOW work even better across a wide variety of devices. It'll support up to 90fps on the Steam Deck through its native app, and it will also stream in 5K on newer LG OLED monitors. LG TVs will also get a native GeForce NOW app that supports up to 4K 120Hz streams, a first for any TV maker. NVIDIA also says that many Logitech racing wheels will be supported, as well. (Though I wonder how many people are traveling with wheels when they want to game on the go.)\nWhile its unclear if game streaming will ever replace local gaming, GeForce NOW is certainly getting close with the addition of RTX 5080 GPUs and a wealth of new features. And given the rise of streaming TV service costs these days, its pricing seems relatively fair. You can test out a free ad-supported version of GeForce NOW, or pay $10 a month (or $100 a year) for ad-free 1,440p support. For most people, especially if they're just streaming to laptops and handhelds, that'll be more than enough. But the Ultimate tier isn't unreasonable at $20 a month, $100 for six months or $200 annually. That's a small price to pay to game in 4K (and 5K!) without a huge rig.\nDuring my recent testing of GeForce NOW Ultimate with RTX 4080 servers, I noticed that it's relatively easy to launch games, performance is generally smooth and it works well across handhelds, TVs and multiple computers. I'd expect much of the same for the RTX 5080 servers, but I'll report back next month when they actually launch.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/nvidias-geforce-now-game-streaming-gets-rtx-5080-gpus-better-image-quality-and-more-193040331.html?src=rss",

    "full_text": "After that, he says Install-to-Play will let Nvidia add many more games and demos to GFN on their release dates than Nvidia can manage on its own, just so long as publishers tick that box. There‚Äôs also a new optional Cinematic Quality Streaming mode you can toggle that Nvidia claims can reduce color bleed and restore detail to dark and blurry areas of a scene as it‚Äôs streamed over the net, and you can now stream at up to 100Mbps, up from 75Mbps previously, to help maintain that quality. How much more performance will you truly get from an RTX 5080 in the cloud? The other caveat is that while Nvidia claims its new Blackwell Superpods are up to 2.8 times faster at gaming, that‚Äôs only if you have DLSS 4 generating three fake frames for every real frame (4x MFG) and being OK with any resulting lag. That said, Tom and I have been impressed with GFN‚Äôs latency in the past. The company claims the 360fps mode can deliver end-to-end latency of just 30ms in Overwatch 2, a game where you don‚Äôt need multi-frame generation (MFG) to get that many frames. When I ask him privately whether Nvidia will increase it later, he can‚Äôt say, but claims GFN has only ever increased price when Nvidia saw a big increase in power usage or needed to rebalance currency exchange in some regions. Additionally, Nvidia is trying an intriguing new experiment that bakes GeForce Now into Discord so gamers can instantly try new games for free right from a Discord server, no GeForce Now login required. He tells The Verge that it‚Äôs merely a ‚Äútechnology announcement‚Äù as of today, but that Nvidia hopes game publishers and developers will reach out if they‚Äôre interested in potentially adding it to their games. Speaking of which, don‚Äôt expect to see Sony or Rockstar games like Grand Theft Auto on the service anytime soon."

It also makes Ford‚Äôs hair look fuller and more realistic, and will be available as an update to the real-time path tracing mode in Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. Image: Nvidia The RTX Hair improvements use new hardware capabilities in RTX 50-series GPUs, as Nvidia added hardware acceleration of ray tracing for hair and fur and support for the linear swept sphere (LSS) primitive. Nvidia says LSS is a ‚Äúbig step toward rendering high-quality digital humans in real time.‚Äù"

    "full_text": "Nvidia has been gradually improving its new app over the past 18 months since its release, and it‚Äôs getting closer to fully migrating all the legacy control panel options. This week‚Äôs Nvidia app update will include anisotropic filtering, anti-aliasing, and ambient occlusion options, meaning you won‚Äôt have to navigate to Nvidia‚Äôs older control panel app to improve classic games. You also won‚Äôt have to configure DLSS override features on a per game basis anymore, as Nvidia is now adding a global option. You can set your DLSS preferences across all override supported games, and Nvidia‚Äôs overlay will also show which DLSS settings are active if you toggle this option on. Nvidia is also bringing its new Smooth Motion feature, which was previously exclusive to RTX 50-series GPUs, to all RTX 40-series owners. Smooth Motion can be applied to games running with DLSS Super Resolution, at native resolution, or even titles with other upscaling technologies. Nvidia says it will typically double ‚Äúthe perceived frame rate.‚Äù If you‚Äôre a fan of Nvidia‚Äôs G-Assist AI assistant, Nvidia is changing the AI model behind the scenes so it will use 40 percent less memory. The smaller footprint won‚Äôt affect performance either, as it‚Äôs designed to respond even faster to queries. These latest Nvidia app changes will arrive on August 19th for beta users at 9AM PT / 12PM ET, followed by a general release next week."

    "summary": "Liquid Glass is a huge new change coming to iOS 26. (Apple)\nWe're past the the halfway point of August, which means that we're very likely less than a month away from Apple's annual iPhone event. In addition to announcing its newest iPhone 17 lineup, the company will also give us an official date for downloading iOS 26. While we wait to find out, you can download and install the newly released public beta 2 (or iOS 26 developer beta 6 for developers). I've been playing around with it for the past couple of weeks, and have found that taking screenshots is way better in the new operating system ‚Äî Google and ChatGPT search options are now in the screenshots editor, for instance. You can see a more complete view of the new features in our preview of the iOS 26 public beta release, which shows off the fresh home and lock screen redesign. Called Liquid Glass, the new translucent look will extend across all of Apple's upcoming operating systems. The overhaul is one of several big changes coming to iOS, macOS, iPadOS and the rest of Apple's software suite, all of which were showcased during the company's WWDC keynote on June 9.\nAfter overpromising on AI plans last year, Apple kept its iOS roadmap focused more on basic quality of life improvements this year. There are multiple useful additions coming to the Phone and Messages apps on your iPhone, for instance: Apple execs outlined the ability to weed out spam texts or other unknown senders and an option to hold your spot on a phone call when you've been waiting for a representative to pick up. Plus, a treasured feature that we took for granted is coming back (hint: it's in the Photos app).\nSiri, meanwhile, is in a holding pattern. Apple has previously specified that its smarter voice assistant ‚Äî first promised at WWDC 2024 ‚Äî is delayed until some point \"in the coming year,\" so you shouldn't expect any major changes in the current betas. But there are reports that Apple is aiming to give Siri a bigger brain transplant by basing it on third-party artificial intelligence models like OpenAI's ChatGPT or Anthropic's Claude, which could make 2026 a pivotal year. The company is also reportedly working on a 'stripped-down' AI chatbot to rival ChatGPT.\nWith each beta, it seems like additional new improvements are popping up, like this new AirPods gesture we're all curious about, and this FaceTime feature that'll freeze your video if it detects nudity. With the release of the iOS 26 developer beta 5, we saw more added features, like a new bouncy animation on the passcode screen and in the Control Center, MacRumors reports. Some or all of those changes will likely soon migrate into the separate public beta (see below). Most newer iPhone models are eligible to download iOS 26 (both the betas and final version). Want to see the full list of new features coming this fall? Read on.¬†\nWhat is iOS 26?\nThe current iPhone operating system is iOS 18, and Apple is still actively updating it ‚Äî version 18.6.1 was just recently released to restore Apple Watch blood oxygen monitoring functionality for certain users in the US, and another minor iOS 18 update is expected before the newest OS is launched, according to a leaker who shared the info with MacRumors. But don't expect to see iOS 19. Instead, Apple is skipping the numbering ahead to iOS 26 later this year. The company has decided to line up its iOS version numbers with a year-based system, similar to car model years. So while iOS and its sibling operating systems will be released in late 2025, they're all designated \"26\" to reflect the year ahead.¬†\nIt's official, we're moving to iOS 26. (Apple)\nWhat is Liquid Glass design?\nLet's be honest. Out of everything announced at WWDC this year, the new Liquid Glass design was the star of the show. The iPhone's home and lock screens have looked pretty much the same year after year ‚Äî the last exciting thing (in my opinion) was the option to add your own aesthetic to your home screen by customizing your apps and widgets. So seeing the home and lock screens' new facelift is refreshing.\nSo what exactly is Liquid Glass? Apple calls it a \"new translucent material\" since, well, the apps and widgets are clear. However, the screen can still adapt to dark and light modes, depending on surroundings. You'll also notice buttons with a new floating design in several apps, like Phone and Maps. They're designed to be less distracting than the current buttons, but are still easy to see. While the design overhaul has proven to be controversial since its announcement, some ‚Äî including Engadget's own Devindra Hardawar ‚Äî like the new direction, even if it's somewhat reminiscent of Microsoft's translucent Windows Vista Aero designs from nearly twenty years ago.\nThat said, as of the release of the iOS 26 beta 2, Apple has already incorporated some user feedback into the design, dialing back the transparency in at least some places. And while it will continue to evolve, Apple users won't be able to escape it: Liquid Glass was designed to make all of Apple's OSes more cohesive. Here's a look at how the translucent aesthetic will look with the new macOS Tahoe 26 on your desktop.\nWhat are the new and notable features of iOS 26?\niOS 26 has a laundry list of new features. Among the most worthwhile:\nPhone app redesign: You'll finally be able to scroll through contacts, recent calls and voicemail messages all on one screen. It also comes with a new feature called Hold Assist that'll notify you when an agent comes to the phone so you can avoid the elevator music and continue on with other tasks.\nLive Translation in Phone, FaceTime and Messages: iOS 26 is bringing the ability to have a conversation via phone call or text message with someone who speaks another language. Live Translation will translate your conversation in real time, which results in some stop-and-go interactions in the examples Apple shared during its presentation.\nPolls in group chats: Tired of sorting through what seems like hundreds of messages in your group chat? You and your friends will soon be able to create polls in group messages for deciding things like which brunch spot you're eating at or whose car you're taking on a road trip.\nFiltering unknown senders in Messages: If you haven't received spam texts about unpaid tolls or other citations, you're lucky. For those of us who have, those annoying messages will soon be filtered away in a separate folder.\nVisual Intelligence: Similar to a reverse Google image search, this new feature will allow you to search for anything that's on your iPhone screen. For instance, if you spot a pair of shoes someone is wearing in an Instagram photo, you can screenshot it and use Visual Intelligence to find those shoes (or similar ones) online.\nPhotos tabs are back: For anyone who's still frustrated with the Photos changes made last year, you'll be happy to know that your tabs are coming back. Library and Collections will have their own separate spaces so you don't have to scroll to infinity to find what you're looking for.\nFaceTime \"Communication Safety\" feature: A newer addition to iOS 26 appears to be the FaceTime \"Communication Safety\" feature that pauses communications if and when nudity is detected. The feature appears to be a child safety feature that uses on-device detection, thus obviating any cloud-based privacy issues.¬†\nNew lock screen options: The iPhone lock screen gets more customizable in iOS 26, with a cooler clock, 3D wallpaper effects, more widgets and better focus mode options.¬†\nApple's Hold Assist will be nifty for those pesky services that put you on hold for 10 or more minutes. (Apple)\nNew changes coming to iPadOS 26\nYour iPad isn't getting left behind when it comes to big updates. Here's what's coming this fall.\nMultitasking and real windowing: When you download the newest update, you'll be able to have multiple apps running on your screen at the same time. Once you open an app, it'll appear on your screen as normal but you'll be able to resize and move it across your screen to make room for other apps. This feature is optional so you can turn it off if you don't like it.\nVisual update: Along with the other new OSes, iPadOS 26 is coming with the Liquid Glass aesthetic. This new look will appear on the lock and home screens, as well as the drop-down menus.\nNew menu bar: When you swipe down on your screen, the new menu bar will appear with options like File, Edit, Windows and more. There's also a search option if you're looking for something specific.\nCheck out our first impressions of iPadOS 26.¬†\nWhat about AirPods?\nAirPods are also getting updated with iOS 26. Here are some of the more notable functions.\nEnhanced audio recording: Apple calls this \"studio-quality\" audio recording, and with it, you'll notice more clarity while in noisy environments.\nCamera remote control: Using this, you can take a photo or start and stop video recording with just one press on your AirPods. When taking photos, you'll get a three-second countdown before your iPhone or iPad snaps the picture.\nLive translation feature: While not officially announced or confirmed, it appears that the long-rumored live translation for AirPods could be coming with iOS 26. The evidence comes from a system asset spotted in the in iOS 26 beta showing a gesture that's triggered by pressing both earbud stems at the same time. The photo also shows words in several different languages.¬†\nWhich iPhones will be able to upgrade to iOS 26?\nA few iPhone models that run the current version of iOS ‚Äî iPhone XR, XS and XS Max ‚Äî won't be compatible with the latest upgrade. But any iPhones released in 2019 or later will be eligible for the iOS 26 update.\n\niPhone SE (second generation or later)\niPhone 11\niPhone 11 Pro\niPhone 11 Pro Max\niPhone 12\niPhone 12 mini\niPhone 12 Pro\niPhone 12 Pro Max\niPhone 13\niPhone 13 mini\niPhone 13 Pro\niPhone 13 Pro Max\niPhone 14\niPhone 14 Plus\niPhone 14 Pro\niPhone 14 Pro Max\niPhone 15\niPhone 15 Plus\niPhone 15 Pro\niPhone 15 Pro Max\niPhone 16\niPhone 16 Plus\niPhone 16 Pro\niPhone 16 Pro Max\niPhone 16e\n\nNot listed here are the presumed new iPhone 17 models (or maybe iPhone 26?) that are all but certain to be announced and released in September.¬†\nHow to install iOS 26 beta\nThe iOS 26 public beta is now available to download via the Apple Beta Software Program. If you're not already a member, you'll need to sign up to try out all the latest features. Just visit beta.apple.com and sign up with your phone number or email address. It's free.\nOnce you're in, you can install it by going to Settings > General > Software Update and selecting iOS 26 public beta.¬†\nA word of caution: Don't sign up with your main iPhone unless you're OK with any risks that occur with using an OS that isn't finalized.\nWhen will the final version of iOS 26 be released?\niOS 26 will be released to the public this fall. It usually comes in September, within a week of the Apple iPhone event. Last year, it rolled out to iPhone users on September 16 ‚Äî exactly one week after the iPhone 16 lineup was announced.\nIf you're more interested in the Apple Intelligence features coming, here's everything Apple revealed for iOS, macOS and more during WWDC. Also, check out how iOS 26 screenshots could be an intriguing preview of Apple's delayed Siri rework.\nUpdate, August 18: Added details about a potential iOS 18.6 update.\nUpdate, August 15: Added to link to what to expect at the Apple iPhone event and details about what's available in the iOS 26 screenshots editor.\nUpdate, August 13: Added new AirPods detail spotted in the iOS 26 beta.\nUpdate, August 11: Noted that iOS 26 developer beta has hit beta 6.¬†\nUpdate, August 8: Added new features coming with iPadOS 26 and AirPods.\nUpdate, August 6: Noted the release of iOS 26 beta 5 and the new bouncy feature on passcode screen and Control Center.\nUpdate, August 4: Noted that Apple is reportedly working on a ChatGPT rival.\nUpdate, August 1: Added quote from Tim Cook about iOS 26.\nUpdate, July 31: Noted that iOS 18.6 is now available.¬†\nUpdate, July 24: Noted the iOS 26 public beta is now available.\nUpdate, July 3: Noted new FaceTime feature found in the developer beta.\nUpdate, June 30: Noted ongoing iOS 18 releases, and reports that Apple is considering additional external LLMs for Siri.¬†\nUpdate, June 25: Noted changes added in iOS 26 beta 2.¬†This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/ios-26-updates-everything-you-need-to-know-about-apples-big-software-changes-coming-to-iphone-and-ipad-135749771.html?src=rss",
    "full_text": "In addition to announcing its newest iPhone 17 lineup, the company will also give us an official date for downloading iOS 26. Called Liquid Glass, the new translucent look will extend across all of Apple's upcoming operating systems. Plus, a treasured feature that we took for granted is coming back (hint: it's in the Photos app). Some or all of those changes will likely soon migrate into the separate public beta (see below). So while iOS and its sibling operating systems will be released in late 2025, they're all designated \"26\" to reflect the year ahead. You'll also notice buttons with a new floating design in several apps, like Phone and Maps. Phone app redesign: You'll finally be able to scroll through contacts, recent calls and voicemail messages all on one screen.

    "full_text": "September is gearing up to be one of the most exciting months of the year for new technology launches, with Meta reportedly set to unveil its next-generation smart glasses. On this display you'll be able to see mini apps and alerts, and you'll have control over the content with assistance from the same neural input wristband used to operate Meta Orion AR glasses. When CNET editor-at-large Scott Stein tried out the concept wristband with Orion earlier this year, he noted that the gestures \"weren't perfect yet,\" but that he could see their potential. Meta has clearly been \"buoyed\" by the success of its Ray-Ban specs, said Leo Gebbie, analyst and Americas director at CCS Insight. The major question for Hypernova will be to what extent does it deviate from the current Ray-Ban smart glasses model, which have proved very successful, he said \"Demand for these glasses has been driven by the fact that they look like normal eyewear from a well-known brand and offer an impressive feature set at a relatively affordable price point.\" Knowing this might be a tough self, Meta has apparently managed to slash that price from $1,000 by accepting lower margins, per Bloomberg. But it's important to note that even at a lower price, you'll likely still pay more for prescription lenses or style variations. The question hanging over any smart glasses, including from Meta, is whether they will one day be capable enough to free us from our smartphones. \"These new premium spec Hypernova smart glasses are taking over more tasks that can be done by a phone by including things like a small screen in the bottom right of the right lens creating Meta's first augmented reality glasses available to consumers,\" Frederick Stanbrell, head of wearables at IDC, said. \"We are likely seeing the first generation of a device that Mark Zuckerberg intends to one day replace phones,\" he said."

The changes follow recent lawsuits against the company, including one from Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill that alleges the platform creates an environment where ‚Äúchild predators thrive.‚Äù It claims Roblox has ‚Äúdirectly facilitated the widespread sexual exploitation of minors and inflicted severe, lasting harm upon the children of Louisiana.‚Äù In response, Roblox said that ‚Äúany assertion that Roblox would intentionally put our users at risk of exploitation is simply untrue.‚Äù Roblox has rolled out many safety-focused features in recent months, including an age estimator tool for users to verify they are over 13 so they can chat with ‚ÄúTrusted Connections,‚Äù accounts parents can use to remotely manage their kids‚Äô accounts, and blocking kids under 13 from accessing social hangout spaces.

Treating gadgets as disposable is an unrealistic way to live, and it places a heavy burden on our already overburdened planet. I'm currently using an iPhone 15 Pro Max that's rapidly approaching its second birthday. I've repaired plenty of tech in my time, usually under the supervision of someone far more skilled than I am, but the stakes feel so much higher. Then I'd have no choice but to invest in a new phone after all. I have to commend the company for its efforts in this direction already. Two months later, Apple started selling replacement components via its Self-Repair Program. That still leaves room for improvement, and I hope to see the iPhone take at least one additional step toward becoming the gold standard in phone repairability this year."

By splitting the release, Apple stays in the news for a longer time, which could help keep sales steady all year.\" Apple saw a 2% decline in shipments of its iPhones in the second quarter of this year. Priyadarshi said the new launch schedule could also be smart from a customer perspective. \"People who want the newest, most advanced models will buy in the fall, while the spring release can attract buyers looking for a more affordable upgrade,\" he said. \"But Apple needs to clearly explain things so that buyers of the regular model don't feel like they're just waiting for a 'lesser' iPhone.\""

Now Samsung has launched the more affordable \"fan edition\" Galaxy Buds 3 FE that look nearly identical to the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro but are missing those buds' LED lighting element, have a single-driver design instead of a dual-driver design and leave off a few other features. They will be available on Sept. 4 in black or gray. Like the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro, the Galaxy Buds 3 FE have a noise-isolating design with silicone ear tips, and they feature noise-canceling as well as a transparency mode. The Galaxy Buds 3 FE's \"blade\" design is a departure from the early Galaxy Buds FE ($70), which have a stemless design with wing tips that help lock the buds in your ears. Since I haven't tried the Galaxy Buds 3 FE yet I can't tell you how much their performance differs from the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro's, but I suspect there will be a slight drop-off in sound quality due to the fact that the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro have a planar driver alongside a dynamic driver that helps improve clarity and treble performance. The Galaxy Buds 3 Pro are regularly on sale (you can get the Latin American version for $125 on Amazon) and Samsung says you can trade in any wired or wireless headset and receive up to $30 off the Galaxy Buds 3 FE. So they, too, should be regularly discounted and perhaps dip to around $100 during the holiday shopping season. I'll let you know how they compare to the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro and other earbuds in their price range as soon as I get my hands on a review sample. For now, here are the Galaxy Buds 3 FE's key specs:"

    "summary": "After largely focusing Google I/O 2025 on the ways the company wants Gemini to change everything from searching the web to filmmaking, Google is finally ready to launch new hardware. The next Made by Google event is on the books for August 20, and Google has already confirmed what at least one of its new Pixel 10 phones will look like.\nGoogle seems dead-set on making a big splash at this event, too. On the Friday before Made by Google, the company dropped a video on X noting that a number of \"special guests\" were participating, including Jimmy Fallon, Stephen Curry, Lando Norris and the Jonas Brothers. What they all will have to do with a phone launch remains to be seen.\nGoogle remains as leak-prone as ever, so nearly all the new hardware the company is expected to announce has all ready been reported on in one form or another. With that in mind and after sifting through what has leaked, here's what Google will show off at the Pixel 10 launch even in New York City on August 20.\nPixel 10, 10 Pro, 10 Pro XL and 10 Pro Fold\nAndroid Headlines / Onleaks \nGoogle's invitation for the event says that the company is sharing \"the latest on our Pixel phones, watches, buds and more,‚Äù which more or less confirms the company will introduce a slate of products that's similar to what it launched in 2024. That means a Pixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro, Pixel 10 Pro XL and Pixel 10 Pro Fold are absolutely on the menu.\nGoogle's tease of the Pixel 10 confirmed what leaked renders have already signaled: the company isn't abandoning the new design language the Pixel 9 established. The pill-shaped camera bump and flat front display will still be present on the Pixel 10, and the real changes will be in the details, like for example, how the flat sides of the Pixel 10 join with the phone's back.\nThose subtle changes will apparently also include the thickness of the Pixel 10s. While both the Pixel 10, 10 Pro, 10 Pro XL and 10 Pro Fold will use the same sized OLED screens as their Pixel 9 counterparts, they'll be housed in thicker and heavier bodies, according to Android Headlines. Google's new Pixels are also supposed to come in new colors. The Pixel 10 will come in \"Frost\" (a royal blue), \"Lemongrass\" (a yellow), \"Indigo\" (a light purple) and \"Obsidian\" (a dark gray), while the Pixel 10 Pro / Pro XL will come in Obsidian, \"Porcelain\" (off-white), \"Moonstone\" (a bluish gray) and \"Jade\" (a light green). Less information is known about the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, though recent leaks suggest it'll come in Moonstone and Jade, as well.\nAndroid Headlines\nThe most visible external change that'll be introduced on the Pixel 10 is the addition of a new telephoto camera. The new telephoto camera is a 11-megapixel 5x telephoto, Android Authority reports, similar to the one on the Pixel 9 Pro Fold. Meanwhile, the Pixel 10 Pro and 10 Pro XL are expected to feature a 50-megapixel wide, 48-megapixel ultrawide, 48-megapixel telephoto and 48-megapixel selfie cameras. The Pixel 10 Pro Fold could feature a different lineup, with a similar main camera, but 12-megapixel ultrawide and telephoto cameras, and 11-megapixel selfie cameras.\nInside the new phones, Google is laying the groundwork for future performance gains with a new Tensor G5 chip. It's likely be much more power-efficient thanks to the company switching to a 3nm design produced by TSMC. Reports suggest the chip might not be all that different in terms of raw power, but the Tensor G5 is likely designed to be extra capable when it comes to using local AI features.\nAs far as timing goes, it's worth noting that the latest rumors indicate that the Pixel 10, 10 Pro and 10 Pro XL will be available about a week after the event, on August 28. But the Pixel 10 Pro Fold (as well as the Pixel Watch 4 and Pixel Buds 2a aren't expected for more than a month after that. Those devices are rumored to be on sale as of October 9.\nWhile global tariff turmoil could justify a price increase, Google is reportedly keeping things consistent with the Pixel 10 family. They'll offer similar storage options, come in at the same prices and include the same freebies and incentives. The Pixel 10 will come with six months of Google AI Pro and Fitbit Premium, along with three months of YouTube Premium. Meanwhile the Pixel 10 Pro models will get a year of Google AI Pro, six months of Fitbit Premium and three months of YouTube Premium. The prices and storage options for the phones should breakout down as follows:\n\nPixel 10: 128GB ($799), 256GB ($899)\nPixel 10 Pro: 128GB ($999), 256GB ($1,099), 512GB ($1,219), 1TB ($1,449)\nPixel 10 Pro XL: 256GB ($1,199), 512GB ($1,319), 1TB ($1,549)\nPixel 10 Pro Fold: 256GB ($1,799), 512GB ($1,919), 1TB ($2,149)\n\nPixel Watch 4\n91mobiles / Onleaks\nThe third time was the charm for the Pixel Watch 3, so the main task Google has with the Pixel Watch 4 is to not squander the solid base it already has. Leaks for the company's new smartwatches have been limited so far, but renders of the Pixel Watch 4 shared by 91mobiles do suggest Google has a few changes planned.\nNamely, much like the company's phones, the new Pixel Watch seems like it'll be a little bit thicker and come with smaller bezels. The Pixel Watch 4 should be available to purchase in the same 41mm and 45mm sizes as before, but in new colors ‚Äî including a Moonstone option to match the Pixel 10 ‚Äî and with a brighter display.\nThe thicker frame will also help the smartwatch fit a larger battery and a new wireless charging system, according to Android Headlines. Rather than charge through a puck with pogo pins like the Pixel Watch 3, the Pixel Watch 4 will use a wireless charging stand that could fill it up even faster.\nBeyond that, Google has already indicated how Wear OS is evolving. The new Wear OS 6 update is debuting on the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8, and will presumably be available on the Pixel Watch 4 at launch. It includes built-in access to Gemini, among other tweaks. Given Google also manages the Fitbit Premium subscription, it wouldn't be all that surprising if the Pixel Watch 4 gets some exclusive fitness tracking features, too.\nPixel Buds 2a\nBilly Steele for Engadget\nGoogle launched the Pixel Buds Pro 2 last year, and it typically doesn't update its premium earbuds on a yearly cadence. So instead, Tom's Guide reports Google might pair the Pixel 10 with the Pixel Buds Pro 2 in a new color, and save its new hardware announcements for a sequel to the Pixel Buds A-series called the Pixel Buds 2a.\nUnlike the company's premium wireless earbuds, the A-series Pixel Buds have historically skimped on things like active noise cancellation to hit a lower price. There's little reporting on where Google will take the Pixel Buds 2a, but you can expect the new earbuds to come in some of the new colors being introduced on the Pixel 10.\nPixelsnap\nThe Qi2 wireless charging standard is available for all phone makers to use, but it hasn't been widely adopted among Android phone makers. Qi2 uses magnets to offer improved charging speeds, just like Apple's MagSafe, and the Pixel 10 could mark Google's adoption of Qi2 through a new feature called \"Pixelsnap.\"\nA report from Android Authority¬†suggests the Pixel 10 will include the necessary magnets to make Qi2 happen, and will be introduced alongside a lineup of Pixelsnap accessories. New leaked images showing a Pixel 10 charging with a magnetic charging puck that looks a lot like Apple's MagSafe charger adds even more credence to the rumor.\nIf you need even more convincing, the Wireless Power Consortium has announced that its faster Qi2 25W charging is coming to \"major Android phones.\" It would make sense if Google's Pixel 10s were included considering runs Android itself.\nGemini and other exclusive software features\nGemini is Google's current favorite, and the company is pushing the AI assistant everywhere it makes sense. The last few Pixel Drops ‚Äî Google's regular Pixel-focused software updates ‚Äî have primarily included Gemini features. It would make sense for Google to include a few more software exclusives on the Pixel 10.\nGoogle is hosting the Pixel 10 launch event on August 20 at 1PM ET / 10AM ET. The company has invited press to attend in person, and you can read coverage of everything Google announces right here on Engadget.\nUpdate, August 6, 12:15PM ET: Added information about the timeline for when Google's new hardware is expected to arrive.\nUpdate, July 30, 2:30PM ET: Added information on pricing for the Pixel 10 lineup and new details on Qi2 support.\nUpdate, July 24, 3:44PM ET: Added details on the Pixel Watch 4's display, new colors and charging stand.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/google-pixel-10-launch-event-new-phones-foldables-and-watches-at-the-made-by-google-event-214510252.html?src=rss",

There are also rumors that Google will reveal the Pixel Watch 4, which could feature longer battery life and faster charging.

    "summary": "It's no secret that Apple devices tend to be in particularly high demand. Unfortunately, that demand can make finding big discounts on Apple gadgets a bit harder than usual. To make things easier, we're keeping a running list of the best Apple deals you can shop right now on AirPods, MacBooks, iPads and more.¬†\nJust note that you‚Äôll almost always find the best Apple deals from third-party retailers like Amazon, Best Buy, Walmart, Target and the like, not from Apple's own online store. Unless you shop refurbished, you‚Äôll usually pay top dollar buying direct (though for some items like iPhones, that might be the best route to take). \nBest Mac deals\n \nApple MacBook Air (15-inch, M4) for $999 ($200 off): The 15-inch MacBook Air is nearly identical to the smaller version but features more robust speakers and a more spacious trackpad alongside its roomier display. $999 is the lowest price we've tracked.\nApple MacBook Air (15-inch, M3, 24GB RAM) for $1,199 ($500 off): The last-gen M3 MacBook Air has officially been discontinued, but it remains a superb laptop while stock remains available. We gave this 15-inch model a score of 90 in our review ‚Äî outside of its slower chip (which is still plenty fast for everyday use), marginally improved camera and inability to power two external displays with the lid open, it's virtually identical to the newer version. This deal applies to the model with 24GB of memory. The 13-inch version, meanwhile, is down to $999 at Best Buy.\nApple MacBook Pro (14-inch, M4 Pro) for $1,699 ($300 off): The MacBook Pro goes beyond most people‚Äôs needs, but it remains a powerhouse for coders, media editors or anyone else with especially demanding workloads. We gave it a score of 92 last November. Just keep in mind that it‚Äôs heavier than the MacBook Air and that it still lacks a standard USB-A port. Also at Best Buy.\nApple Mac mini (M4) for $499 ($100 off): The newest version of Apple‚Äôs tiny desktop PC has a smaller overall footprint, a faster M4 chip, 16GB of RAM as standard (finally), two front-facing USB-C ports (finally!), an extra Thunderbolt 4 port and the ability to drive three external displays. It lacks USB-A ports, however. We gave the M4 Pro model a review score of 90. This deal is for the entry-level version with a base M4 chip, 16GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD ‚Äî we‚Äôve seen it fall as low as $469 in the past, but this is still a decent savings compared to buying direct from Apple. Also at Best Buy.\nBest AirPods deals\n \nApple AirPods Pro 2 for $169 ($80 off): The AirPods Pro 2 are Apple‚Äôs best set of wireless earbuds for now, as they offer the full set of Apple-focused features, strong ANC, onboard volume controls, a comfy in-ear design and a warm sound profile that most should find agreeable. They can even work as a hearing aid, though their six-hour battery life still isn‚Äôt the best, and you should only get them if you‚Äôre all-in on Apple hardware. But if that‚Äôs the case, we consider them the best wireless earbuds for iPhone owners. This deal is $20 off the all-time low we saw last month, but it's still a ways below the set's usual going rate. Also at Walmart and Best Buy. Exercise caution, though: If you're not in a rush, this is another Apple device that may see a refresh within the next couple of months.\nBest iPad deals\n \nApple iPad Pro 11-inch (M4) for $896 ($104 off): The iPad Pro is much more tablet than most people need, but it‚Äôs the ultimate iPad for those who can stomach its price tag. It‚Äôs wonderfully thin, its OLED display is one of the best we‚Äôve seen on a consumer device and its M4 chip can handle virtually anything you‚Äôd ever do on an iPad. It‚Äôs also the only Apple tablet with Face ID, plus it has a better speaker setup than the iPad Air. We gave it a score of 84 in our review, with the only real drawback being its price. Also at BJ's for $50 less, if you have a membership there.\nBest Apple Watch deals\n \nApple Watch Ultra 2 for $650 ($149 off): Apple‚Äôs most premium smartwatch, the Ultra 2 has a killer 36-hour battery life, a handy Low Power mode for extended use and cellular connectivity by default. It also has a compass app, water temperature gauge and a loud onboard siren that you can trigger in emergencies. This discount marks the lowest price we've tracked. But again, we wouldn't be surprised if Apple introduced an updated model in the coming weeks.\nApple Watch SE (GPS, 40mm) for $169 ($80 off): As with the more premium models, we wouldn‚Äôt be surprised to see an update to Apple‚Äôs budget smartwatch sometime soon (and we have a few suggestions on the matter). But thanks to some serious discounts, the Apple Watch SE has turned out to be the most affordable way to get an iPhone companion for your wrist. Despite a lackluster screen and limited extra features, it handles the basics well. Also at Target.\nBest Apple accessories deals\n \nApple Pencil (USB-C) for $69 ($10 off): This more affordable Apple Pencil doesn‚Äôt support pressure sensitivity, but it still makes for a useful stylus for the basics. If you‚Äôre a casual note-taker and can live without wireless charging, you‚Äôll save a few bucks by picking this one up. Also at Walmart.\nRead more Apple coverage:\n\nThe best AirPods\nThe best Apple Watches\nThe best MacBooks\nThe best iPhones\nThe best iPads\n\nFollow @EngadgetDeals on X for the latest tech deals and buying advice.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/best-apple-deals-150020110.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "The back-to-school season is a good time to save on tech, whether you're returning to campus or not. While some discounts are reserved for students, others are available to everyone. One of the best right now is on Apple's M3-powered iPad Air, which is somewhat of a goldilocks tablet ‚Äî one that will be a great option for just about everyone. You can grab it for $150 off at Amazon right now.\nThis deal applies to each configuration of the 11-inch and 13-inch versions of the most recent iPad Air. So, the 11-inch model is as low as $449, while the 13-inch model is down to $649. The same deals can be found at Best Buy and Target if you prefer to shop somewhere other than Amazon. This is an all-time low price and beats the deal we saw on Prime Day by $30. \n \nThe iPad Air M3 is more of an iterative refresh than a grand overhaul, but the spec bump means it‚Äôll last you a long time before the tablet‚Äôs performance becomes a problem. This iPad occupies the position of \"best for most\" in our iPad buying guide, reinforcing that goldilocks analogy. The M3 chip is the main draw here, with Geekbench 6 scores proclaiming it around 16 percent more powerful than the M2 iPad Air, which is no slouch itself.\nBeyond the chip, it has a superior display and speakers to the entry-level model, and wider accessory support. You also get the option of a 13-inch display, which is great for artists or anyone who sees the iPad as a viable laptop replacement.\nIf there‚Äôs an obvious downside to the iPad Air M3, it‚Äôs that it doesn't have the nice 120Hz OLED display of the iPad Pro. This is hardly surprising, as Apple often focuses on display tech to differentiate its Pro and non-Pro devices, but it‚Äôs probably time the refresh rate on the middle-of-the-road iPad at least jumped up to ProMotion. Face ID is long overdue too. If you can live with these caveats, though, the iPad Air is an excellent option, particularly at this price.\nIf you think the Air is too much for your needs, the iPad A16, Apple's entry-level tablet, is down to $299 right now. It was slightly cheaper during Prime Day in July, but this discount is still worth considering if you're looking to pick up a newer iPad for less.\n \nCheck out our coverage of the best Apple deals for more discounts, and follow @EngadgetDeals on X for the latest tech deals and buying advice.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/apples-ipad-air-m3-is-150-off-and-down-to-a-record-low-162908393.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "The Pixel 9 Pro Fold was one of my favorite gadgets of 2024 to the point where it even landed on our list of the biggest winners of the year. Not only was it a worthy alternative to Samsung's long-running Galaxy Z Fold phones, its straightforward design once again proved that keeping things simple is often the wisest way to go. It turns out, the best approach to foldable phone design is to make something that's the same size and shape as a regular handset, but just happens to have a big flexible display hidden inside.\nHowever, after using the Pixel 9 Pro Fold (which I will refer to as the P9PF for short) for just shy of a year, I wanted to re-review the device to reflect on how it held up after 11 months of wear and tear and to consider what Google might be able to improve on the next model.\nDesign and features\nSam Rutherford for Engadget\nGoogle figured out something when it shifted away from the short and squat dimensions of the original Pixel Fold for its second foldable phone. By making the Pixel 9 Pro Fold's exterior display essentially the same size as a normal Pixel 9, the company eliminated any confusion for when you just want to quickly send a text, check a map or doomscroll on social media. The obvious downside to this is that when you open the phone up, its interior display has essentially a square aspect ratio, which isn't great for watching movies. However, with an increased size of eight inches across, the P9PF still has one of the largest flexible panels around, so it's not like anyone was really hurting for screen real estate. And for stuff like games, comics or ebooks, it's arguably even better. If manufacturers were able to bring the price of foldables down, they might kill the market for small tablets (nine inches and under) overnight.\nOn top of that, unlike Samsung‚Äôs foldables, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold didn't really sacrifice on camera quality or features. It has a 5x optical zoom just like you get on a standard Pixel 9 Pro, and while it doesn't have the same main sensor, you'd be hard-pressed to tell unless you do some serious side-by-side pixel peeping. Plus, you get fun tools like Look at Me that are only possible due to its foldable design, not to mention other nifty features like Add Me.\nSam Rutherford for Engadget\nGranted, Google's Tensor G4 chip lags behind equivalent Qualcomm Snapdragon processors. But it's still fast enough for everything I‚Äôve thrown at it, aside from maybe hardcore video editing or the most demanding games. And I maintain that foldable phones are still the best devices for mobile trading card apps like Marvel Snap or Pok√©mon TCG Pocket. The presence of a big screen that can be deployed or hidden away at a moment's notice is perfect for matches that only last a couple of minutes, so you can squeeze a round in pretty much anywhere or any time.\nDurability\nI'm not a fan of cases. That‚Äôs true even on foldables, because while they are more fragile than a typical smartphone, the added bulk and heft that comes with most aftermarket protectors are just kind of annoying. Furthermore, especially in recent years, most foldables are generally tough enough to withstand life's everyday drops and tumbles. Unless you're out there regularly burying your phone in the sand or dropping it on concrete, my experience with previous foldables (from both Samsung and Google) has me feeling relatively confident about their overall durability.\nSam Rutherford for Engadget\nThat said, I did make one small change when living with the P9PF. Instead of a case, I installed a skin from Dbrand (which I bought myself) to give the phone a tiny extra cushion in the back. Granted, there are still several scratches and dings on its frame and front screen. But that was kind of the point. I wanted to see how Google's second-gen foldable would hold up with minimal protection and this phone has probably taken more of a beating than any device I've owned to date.\nFun fact: I shot and edited the review photos for the Pixel 9 Pro Fold just an hour before I had to go to the hospital for the birth of my daughter. And in the time since, the P9PF has been spat up on, crawled on, walked on by my three-year-old son and fallen out of my pocket during bathtime a countless number of times. And for the most part, it's taken those hits like a boxer with an iron chin (or in Google's case, aluminum).\nSam Rutherford for Engadget\nIf you're really trying to maximize resale value, you may want something more substantial. For everyone else, the addition of a skin and a screen protector for its exterior display is all you really need. My Pixel 9 Pro Fold's interior screen is still pristine after almost a year. Yes, it has a crease, but if that's an issue, you may never be able to own a foldable phone. Or at the very least, not in the near future. Meanwhile, the blemishes elsewhere aren't distracting enough to make using the P9PF any less enjoyable. Though everyone is different, so you may feel otherwise.\nPotential concerns\nThe one potential issue going forward is that in just the last couple of weeks, I've noticed the phone occasionally takes longer to turn on the inner display after opening it up. It doesn‚Äôt happen every time and it'll usually fix itself in a few seconds or after a couple taps. Furthermore, sometimes the phone's SIM card will stop working too, which can be addressed by resetting the Pixel's internet connections.\nSam Rutherford for Engadget\nWhile I haven't been able to confirm if this is due to a software update (like a recent Android patch) or something loose inside (possibly a shaky display cable), it sounds very similar to a thread I spotted recently on Reddit. Based on the post, the owner of that P9PF takes much better care of their phone than I do, which suggests the cause may be related to build quality or its underlying design instead of simple wear and tear. Regardless, if you own a Pixel 9 Pro Fold and have also run into this issue, let me know so I can investigate this further.\nFuture outlook\nEven with a possible service call clouding the future of my Pixel 9 Pro Fold, I've thoroughly enjoyed my time with it over the last year. Pairing a bigger flexible screen with best-in-class cameras and a simple but very effective design is a winning formula for a modern foldable. And while I don't expect a full redesign this year after the big jump we got from the OG Pixel Fold, if Google can tweak little things like the awkward-looking corner in the top left of its exterior display, improve durability and maybe increase the battery capacity in addition to its usual assortment of yearly AI-powered tools and features, the Pixel 10 Pro Fold could be a very solid followup.\nI took the skin off for this story and as you can see, it did a good job of protecting the backside of the phone.¬†Sam Rutherford for Engadget\nHowever, the arrival of the Galaxy Z Fold 7 means Google has some work to do. I'm waiting to see what the next foldable Pixel brings (and hopefully the OnePlus Open 2 as well) before picking which phone I want to use for the next year. Unless Google or OnePlus can match the exquisite thinness, excellent performance and improved battery life on Samsung's latest flagship, I feel like I'm going to be doing the gadget version of the distracted boyfriend meme every time I go to pick up a significantly thicker rival. That said, things like Google's software and superior cameras might pull me back.\nBut perhaps the most impressive thing is that after just two generations, the Pixel Fold line has almost completely caught up to the latest Z Fold with the chance to pull ahead next week. And for anyone who's ever considering getting a foldable phone (or maybe even their second, third or fourth), that's exactly the kind of competition I like to see.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/pixel-9-pro-fold-one-year-later-how-google-caught-up-to-samsung-in-just-two-generations-130008722.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "If you want to get the most out of your games ‚Äî whether you're into competitive FPS titles, sprawling RPGs or story-driven adventures ‚Äî a good gaming monitor can make all the difference. Smooth gameplay, low input lag and crisp visuals are just the start. With the right screen, everything from your aim to your immersion gets a serious upgrade.These days, there‚Äôs a lot more to consider than just refresh rate or screen size. You‚Äôll find ultrawide gaming monitors, widescreen displays, models with USB-C support, and monitors that can bring out the best in your CPU and GPU. Some even match the style of your setup, pairing perfectly with gaming headsets and accessories for a clean, cohesive look.Whether you're shopping on a tighter price range or splurging on high-end picture quality, we‚Äôve rounded up the best options to suit different setups and play styles ‚Äî so you can level up your experience without the guesswork.\nTable of contents\n\nBest gaming monitors for 2025\nHow we test gaming monitors\nFactors to consider before buying a gaming monitor\nGaming monitor FAQs\n\n\nBest gaming monitors for 2025\n \n \n \n \n \nHow we test gaming monitors\nWhile I‚Äôve not used every product recommended in our list, I have extensively tested dozens of gaming monitors in the past, including models with WOLED and QD-OLED panels. In the case of the Alienware monitor I highlight above, I bought one for myself with my own money. Separately, I spent dozens of hours over a two-year period researching computer monitor options to write the current version of this guide. \nFactors to consider before buying a gaming monitor\nLCD vs OLED\nWhen shopping for a gaming monitor, you first need to decide if you want to go with a screen that has an LCD or OLED panel. For most people, that choice will come down to price; OLED gaming monitors are more expensive than their LCD counterparts. Even if money isn‚Äôt a concern, the choice might not be as straightforward as you think; both LCD and OLED panels come in a few different flavors, and knowing the differences between each type is important to making an informed decision.\nLCD monitors come in three different varieties: twisted nematic (TN), vertical alignment (VA) or in-plane switching (IPS). For the most part, you want to avoid TN monitors unless you‚Äôre strapped for cash or want a monitor with the fastest possible refresh rate or fast response rate. TN screens feature the worst viewing angles, contrast ratios and colors of the group.\nThe differences between VA and IPS panels are more subtle. Historically, VA gaming monitors featured slower pixel response times than their TN and IPS counterparts, leading to unsightly image smearing. However, that‚Äôs improved in recent years. VA panels also frequently sport better contrast ratios than both TN and IPS screens. They‚Äôre not dramatically better than their IPS siblings on that front, but when contrast ratios aren‚Äôt an inherent strength of LCDs, every bit helps.\nOn the other hand, IPS panels excel at color accuracy and many offer high refresh rates and response times that are as fast as the fastest TN panels. The majority of LCD gaming monitors on the market today feature IPS panels, though you will frequently find VA screens on ultrawide monitors.\nWhat about OLED?\nIf you can afford one, an OLED screen makes for the best monitor for gaming. The ability of organic light-emitting diodes to produce true blacks is transformational. Simply put, every game looks better when there isn‚Äôt a backlight to wash out shadow detail. Plus, you can experience true HDR with an OLED screen, something that LCDs aren‚Äôt known for.\nToday, OLED screens come in two different flavors: WOLED and QD-OLED, with LG producing the former and Samsung the latter. I won‚Äôt bore you with the technical details of how the two panel types differ from one another other than to note both technologies broadly offer the same set of shortcomings.\nMost notably, OLED monitors don‚Äôt get very bright. At best, the most capable models peak at around 250 nits when measuring brightness across the entire screen. I didn‚Äôt find this to be an issue in my testing, but your experience may vary depending on the ambient light in your gaming setup.\nIf brightness is important to you, note that due to manufacturer tunings, different models can perform better than others, even if they feature the same panel from LG or Samsung. It‚Äôs worth comparing monitors in the same class to find the model that‚Äôs right for you.\nSeparately, almost all OLEDs feature sub-pixel layouts that produce text fringing in Windows. The latest generation of OLED panels from both LG and Samsung are much better in this regard, to the point where modern OLEDs are good enough for reading and image editing. However, it‚Äôs still worth going to your local Micro Center or Best Buy to see the model you want in person, as the text fringing issue is hard to capture in photos and videos.\nAnother (potentially more serious) issue is burn-in. Organic light-emitting diodes can get ‚Äústuck‚Äù if they display the same image for long periods of time. Every OLED gaming monitor you can buy today comes with features designed to prevent burn-in and other image quality issues. Provided you don‚Äôt use your new OLED monitor for eight hours of daily productivity work, I don‚Äôt think you need to worry about burn-in too much.\nScreen size, resolution and aspect ratio\nAfter deciding where you fall on the LCD vs OLED debate, you can start thinking about the size of your future gaming monitor. Personal preference and the limitations of your gaming setup will play a big part here, but there are also a few technical considerations. You should think about size in conjunction with resolution and aspect ratio.\nA 1440p monitor has 78 percent more pixels than a 1080p resolution screen, and a 4K display has more than twice as many pixels as a QHD panel. As the size of a monitor increases, pixel density decreases unless you also increase resolution. For that reason, there are sweet spots between size and high resolution. For instance, I wouldn‚Äôt recommend buying an FHD monitor that is larger than 24 inches or a QHD one bigger than 27 inches. Conversely, text and interface elements on a 4K monitor can look tiny without scaling on panels smaller than 32 inches.\nYou also need to consider the performance costs of running games at higher resolutions. The latest entry-level GPUs can comfortably run most modern games at 1080p and 60 frames per second. They can even render some competitive titles at 120 frames per second and higher ‚Äî but push them to run those same games at 1440p and beyond, and you‚Äôre bound to run into problems. And as you‚Äôll see in a moment, a consistently high frame rate is vital to getting the most out of the latest gaming monitors.\nIf your budget allows for it, 1440p offers the best balance between image quality and gaming performance. As for 1080p resolution and 4K, I would only consider the former if you‚Äôre on a tight budget or enjoy competitive gaming shooters like Valorant and Overwatch 2. For most people, the user experience and productivity benefits of QHD far outweigh the performance gains you get from going with a lower resolution screen.\nJust a few years ago, 4K was not a viable resolution for PC gaming, but then NVIDIA came out with its 40 series GPUs. With those video cards offering the company‚Äôs DLSS 3 frame generation technology, there‚Äôs a case to be made that the technology is finally there to play 4K games at a reasonable frame rate, particularly if you exclusively play big, AAA single-player games like Alan Wake 2 and Cyberpunk 2077 or enjoy strategy games like the Total War series. However, even with frame generation, you will need a GPU like the $999 RTX 4080 Super or $1,599 RTX 4090 to drive a 4K display. Plus, 4K gaming monitors tend to cost more than their 1440p counterparts.\nIf you want an ultrawide, note that not every game supports the 21:9 aspect ratio, and fewer still support 32:9. When shopping for a curved monitor, a lower Radius, or ‚ÄòR‚Äô number, indicates a more aggressive curve. So, a 1000R monitor is more curved than an 1800R one.\n\n\n\n\n   Photo by Igor Bonifacic / Engadget \n \n\nRefresh rates and response times\nAnd now, finally, for the fun stuff. The entire reason to buy a gaming monitor is for its ability to draw more images than a traditional computer monitor. As you shop for a new screen, you will see models advertising refresh rates like 120Hz, 240Hz and 360Hz. The higher the refresh rate of a monitor, the more times it can update the image it displays on screen every second, thereby producing a smoother moving image. When it comes to games like Overwatch, Valorant and League of Legends, a faster refresh rate can give you a competitive edge, but even immersive single-player games can benefit.\nA monitor with a 240Hz refresh rate will look better in motion than one with a 120Hz refresh rate, but there are diminishing returns. At 60Hz, the image you see on your computer monitor is updated every 16.67ms. At 120Hz, 240Hz and 360Hz, the gap between new frames shortens to 8.33ms, 4.17ms and 2.78ms, respectively. Put another way, although a 360Hz monitor can display 50 percent more frames than a 240Hz screen in a given time period, you will only see a speedup of 1.14ms between frame intervals. And all that depends on your GPU‚Äôs ability to render a consistent 360 frames per second.\nUltimately, a fast response monitor will do you no good if you don't have a gaming PC with a graphics card that can keep up. For example, with a 1440p 360Hz monitor, you realistically need a GPU like the RTX 4070 Super or RTX 4080 Super to saturate that display while playing competitive gaming titles like Overwatch 2 and Valorant.\nThere‚Äôs also more to motion clarity than refresh rates alone. Just as important are fast response times, or the amount of time it takes for pixels to transition from one color to another and then back again. Monitors with slow response times tend to produce smearing that is distracting no matter what kind of game you‚Äôre playing. Curved gaming monitor options help with immersion by wrapping the screen around your field of vision, making the gaming setup feel more expansive. Unfortunately, response times are also one of the more opaque aspects of picking the best gaming monitor for your needs.\nMany LCD monitor manufacturers claim their products feature 1ms gray-to-gray (GtG) response times, yet they don‚Äôt handle motion blur to the same standard. One of the reasons for that is that many companies tend to cherry-pick GtG results that make their monitors look better on paper. The Video Electronics Standards Association (VESA) recently created a new certification program to address that problem, but the grading system is unwieldy and, as far as I can tell, hasn‚Äôt had a lot of pickup from manufacturers.\nFor now, your best bet is to turn to resources like Rtings and Monitors Unboxed when shopping for a new gaming monitor. Both outlets conduct extensive testing of every screen they review and present their findings and recommendations in a way that‚Äôs easy to understand.\nFreeSync vs G-Sync\nNo matter how powerful your system, it will sometimes fail to maintain a consistent framerate. In fact, you should expect frame rate fluctuations when playing graphically-intensive games like Alan Wake 2 and Cyberpunk 2077. For those moments, you want a gaming display with adaptive sync. Otherwise, you can run into screen tearing.\nAdaptive sync technologies come in a few flavors. The two you‚Äôre most likely to encounter are AMD FreeSync and NVIDIA G-Sync, and each has its own set of performance tiers. With G-Sync, for instance, they are ‚Äì from lowest to highest ‚Äì G-Sync Compatible, G-Sync and G-Sync Ultimate.\nThe good news is that you don‚Äôt need to think too much about which adaptive sync technology a display supports. In the early days of the tech, it was rare to see a gaming monitor that offered both FreeSync and G-Sync since including the latter meant a manufacturer had to equip their display with a dedicated processor from NVIDIA. That changed in 2019 when the company introduced its G-Sync Compatible certification. Today, if a monitor supports FreeSync, it is almost certainly G-Sync Compatible, too, meaning you can enjoy tear-free gaming whether you‚Äôre using an AMD or NVIDIA GPU.\nIn fact, I would go so far as to say you shouldn‚Äôt make your purchasing decision based on the level of adaptive sync performance a monitor offers. As of right now, the list of G-Sync Ultimate-certified displays is about two dozen models long, and some are a few years old now.\n\n\n\n\n   Photo by Igor Bonifacic / Engadget \n \n\nInputs\nAlmost every gaming display on the market right now comes with at least one DisplayPort 1.4 connection, and that‚Äôs the port you will want to use to connect your new monitor to your graphics card. If you own a PS5 or Xbox Series X/S, it‚Äôs also worth looking out for monitors that come with HDMI 2.1 ports, as those will allow you to get the most out of your current generation console.\nA word about HDR\nAs fast and responsive gaming monitors have become in recent years, there‚Äôs one area where progress has been frustratingly slow: HDR performance. The majority of gaming monitors currently on sale, including most high-end models, only meet VESA‚Äôs DisplayHDR 400 certification. As someone who owned one such monitor, let me tell you it‚Äôs not even worth turning on HDR on those screens. You will only be disappointed.\nThe good news is that things are getting better, albeit slowly. The release of Windows 11 did a lot to improve the state of HDR on PC, and more games are shipping with competent HDR modes, not just ones that increase the brightness of highlights. Thankfully, with more affordable mini-LED monitors, like our top pick, making their way to the market, HDR gaming is finally within reach of most PC gamers.\nGaming monitor FAQs\nAre curved monitors better for gaming?\nIt depends on personal preference. Many manufacturers claim curved monitors offer a more immersive gaming experience due to the way the display wraps around your field of vision. However, I find the edge distortion distracting, particularly when you increase the field of view in a game.\nWhat aspect ratio should I look for in a gaming monitor?\nThe vast majority of 24-, 27- and 32-inch gaming monitors feature 16:9 aspect ratio panels, and that‚Äôs been the case for many years. In fact, nearly every game made in the last two decades supports 16:9 resolutions, such as 1,920 x 1,080 and 2,560 by 1,440, and if you buy a standard-sized monitor, you won‚Äôt need to worry about letterboxing.\nIn the case of ultrawides, 21:9 is the most common aspect ratio, with some very wide models sporting 32:9 panels. Among games, support for 21:9 and 32:9 resolutions is far from universal, so don‚Äôt be surprised if a game doesn‚Äôt fill the entirety of your screen.\nIs OLED good for gaming?\nOLED monitors are great for gaming. Not only do they offer excellent motion clarity and input latency, but they‚Äôre also easily the best displays for HDR gaming. If money is no object, and you primarily use your PC for gaming, you can‚Äôt go wrong with an OLED monitor.\nHow much does a good gaming monitor cost?\nWhile you could easily spend more than $1,000 to obtain the best gaming monitor on the market now, the reality is that the budget and midrange categories have never been more competitive. In 2015, I spent $500 CAD to buy a 1080p monitor with a 144Hz refresh rate and TN panel. The budget AOC model I highlight above is not only cheaper than my first gaming monitor, but it also features a faster 180Hz refresh rate and a higher contrast VA panel.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/best-gaming-monitor-140008940.html?src=rss",
    "full_text": "With a 180Hz refresh rate, it‚Äôs also fast enough for all but the most fast-paced competitive esports games. From a performance standpoint, the only downside is that it won‚Äôt produce true blacks in rooms with too much ambient light. For most people, that choice will come down to price; OLED gaming monitors are more expensive than their LCD counterparts. Every OLED gaming monitor you can buy today comes with features designed to prevent burn-in and other image quality issues. Monitors with slow response times tend to produce smearing that is distracting no matter what kind of game you‚Äôre playing. Many LCD monitor manufacturers claim their products feature 1ms gray-to-gray (GtG) response times, yet they don‚Äôt handle motion blur to the same standard. In fact, you should expect frame rate fluctuations when playing graphically-intensive games like Alan Wake 2 and Cyberpunk 2077. The good news is that you don‚Äôt need to think too much about which adaptive sync technology a display supports. In fact, I would go so far as to say you shouldn‚Äôt make your purchasing decision based on the level of adaptive sync performance a monitor offers. As fast and responsive gaming monitors have become in recent years, there‚Äôs one area where progress has been frustratingly slow: HDR performance."

    "summary": "Deserved or not, Apple has turned AirPods into the default choice for most iPhone owners in the market for new wireless earbuds. But if you‚Äôre one of the millions who have an Android smartphone, figuring out which set to grab isn‚Äôt as obvious. If you need a hand, allow us to point you in the right direction. We‚Äôve tested and reviewed dozens of wireless earbuds over the years and broken down our favorite options for Android users below. Whether you use a Galaxy or a Pixel phone, and whether you want something for the gym or your morning commute, here are the best AirPods alternatives for Android.\nTable of contents\n\nThe best Android earbuds for 2025\nWhat to look for in wireless earbuds for Android devices\nHow we test Android earbuds\nRecent updates\n\nBest Android earbuds for 2025\n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhat to look for in wireless earbuds for Android devices\n\n\n\n\n   Photo by Jeff Dunn / Engadget \n \n\nFor the most part, the features you want from a set of ‚ÄúAndroid earbuds‚Äù are the same as what you want from any headphones. Great sound quality, a comfortable fit and sufficient battery life are still the foundations. Adequate water resistance is good for workouts, and nobody wants a crummy mic for making calls. Once you approach the $100 range, features like active noise cancellation (ANC), wireless charging, an ambient sound mode (which lets you better hear outside noise without turning off your music) and multipoint connectivity (the ability to pair with multiple devices simultaneously) should be expected. \nFor Android devices specifically, there are a few extras to consider. A dedicated app that makes it easy to switch sound modes, customize the audio profile, locate your earbuds if they ever get misplaced or adjust other settings is strongly preferred. Features like Google Fast Pair or NFC-based pairing, which can help you avoid having to dig through your Bluetooth menu to connect your earbuds for the first time, are also nice perks. Some Android devices can also utilize higher-quality Bluetooth codecs such as aptX Adaptive or Sony‚Äôs LDAC ‚Äî these aren‚Äôt nearly as important to audio quality as the actual architecture of your earbuds, but they can help wring out a little more detail if the buds are capable enough and you‚Äôre streaming lossless files. AptX Adaptive can also help reduce latency, which is good for streaming video or gaming.\nDiversity is Android‚Äôs greatest strength, but it also means that some wireless earbuds play nicer with certain devices, typically those made by the same company. Recent Samsung earbuds, for instance, come with a few perks that are only available if you use a Galaxy phone. We have a couple of recommendations related to this idea above.\nHow we test Android earbuds\n\n\n\n\n   Photo by Billy Steele/Engadget \n \n\nThe best way to test earphones is simply to wear them as much as possible, so that‚Äôs what we do. We typically do this over a one- to two-week period, though embargo times occasionally force us to finish our review process a bit faster. We listen to a test playlist that includes several musical genres and podcasts, paying close attention to how each pair approaches the bass, mid and treble frequencies to get an accurate sense of its sound profile. We also test at high and low volumes to check for consistency in the tuning. We do not have access to a dummy head to take more objective measurements, but we‚Äôll sometimes look to sites like Rtings, SoundGuys and others that do just to ensure our impressions are not wildly off-base. If a model supports custom EQ, we‚Äôll tinker with that and use the available EQ presets to see if one sounds dramatically better than the others ‚Äî though in general we base most of our impressions on the stock tuning each pair uses by default.\nTo assess microphone quality, we record our own audio samples and take multiple calls with a partner both indoors and outside. For battery life, we play our test playlist on a loop with the volume around 75 percent and measure how long it takes for each set to drain. Where applicable, we do a thorough review of a pair‚Äôs companion app and test each available feature. While comfort is ultimately subjective, we take note of how secure each pair feels while we‚Äôre on the move. We also use certain pairs in especially crowded public spaces to get a better sense of their passive and active noise cancellation, as well as their ability to maintain a consistent Bluetooth connection.\nRecent updates\nAugust 2025: We‚Äôve taken another sweep to ensure our advice is still up-to-date.\nMay 2025: We‚Äôve checked this guide to ensure our top picks still stand and noted a couple alternatives to the Noble Fokus Rex5, since that pair has had stock issues of late. We‚Äôre also keeping an eye on how the Trump administration‚Äôs tariff policy affects the pricing and stock of our recommendations (and the consumer tech industry as a whole). All of our picks are still available in their normal price ranges today, but we‚Äôll update this guide if that changes.\nFebruary 2025: The Noble FoKus Rex5 is our new \"best for sound quality\" pick, replacing the Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 4. Our other recommendations remain unchanged.\nDecember 2024: We‚Äôve lightly edited this guide for clarity and ensured that our current picks are still accurate.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/best-earbuds-for-android-devices-120015765.html?src=rss",
    "full_text": "But no other wireless earbuds we‚Äôve tested have managed to tick so many boxes. Its unique five-driver design helps it draw out a remarkable level of detail and properly separate the instrumentation in any given track. The soundstage is wider than most true wireless earbuds we‚Äôve tested, while support for LDAC and aptX Adaptive only assist with detail retrieval. Yes, we‚Äôre recommending a set of Apple-made earbuds in an Android buying guide. But while they work best with iPhones, most of their AirPods-style features are also available on Android through the Beats app. This kind of walled garden approach is frustrating; remember when you could plug your headphones into any device and it‚Äôd work the same way every time? AptX Adaptive can also help reduce latency, which is good for streaming video or gaming. August 2025: We‚Äôve taken another sweep to ensure our advice is still up-to-date. All of our picks are still available in their normal price ranges today, but we‚Äôll update this guide if that changes.

    "summary": "\nSoon after the Apple iPhone event takes place, we'll finally have access to iOS 26 and iPadOS 26 ‚Äî both of which are bringing huge upgrades to your iPhone and iPad's operating systems. One you might be thrilled to play around with is the visual update: Liquid Glass. (It's like the better-executed version of Windows Vista.) We spent two weeks test-driving it ‚Äî you can check out our detailed hands-on iOS 26 preview, or you can try it out yourself by downloading and installing the public beta 2. That software is a more stable iteration of the separate developer version, which recently hit the beta 6 waypoint, and offers a few more flashy features not yet available in the public version. (While the public beta is open to everyone and quite stable, always remember there's a degree of risk involved with beta software.) Additionally, there are credible reports that iOS 26 could bring a new live translation feature to AirPods, too. Not ready to upgrade your smartphone or tablet this year? No worries, we'll help you find out if your devices will be able to run iOS 26.\nWhile Apple didn't nix any iPhones from its eligibility list last year, that's not the case for 2025 ‚Äî a few models are getting cut this time. All iPhone 8 models and the iPhone X were the last to get the boot in 2023, and this year the 2018 models are getting left behind. If you have an ineligible device, you won't be able to download iOS 26 when it becomes available this fall.¬†\nWe'll get to the bottom of which iPhones and iPads will support iOS 26 and iPadOS 26 this year. To see what's coming with the latest OSes, check out everything announced at Apple's WWDC June 9 event. One thing you shouldn't immediately expect is Apple's updated version of Siri, though the company is reportedly working on a 'stripped-down' AI chatbot to compete with ChatGPT.¬†\nThese three iPhones won't be compatible with iOS 26\nUnlike last year, several iPhone models won't be eligible to download the newest iOS when it makes its debut this fall. This trio of models first released in 2018 won't be coming to the iOS 26 party:\n\niPhone XR\niPhone XS\niPhone XS Max\n\niPhones compatible with iOS 26\nWhile we don't yet know the new iPhones Apple will be dropping this fall ‚Äî though there are iPhone 17 rumors ‚Äî we do know, per Apple's site, that the phones listed below will be compatible with iOS 26. Basically, if you have an iPhone that was announced in 2019 or later, you're in the clear:\n\niPhone SE (second generation or later)\niPhone 11\niPhone 11 Pro\niPhone 11 Pro Max\niPhone 12\niPhone 12 mini\niPhone 12 Pro\niPhone 12 Pro Max\niPhone 13\niPhone 13 mini\niPhone 13 Pro\niPhone 13 Pro Max\niPhone 14\niPhone 14 Plus\niPhone 14 Pro\niPhone 14 Pro Max\niPhone 15\niPhone 15 Plus\niPhone 15 Pro\niPhone 15 Pro Max\niPhone 16\niPhone 16 Plus\niPhone 16 Pro\niPhone 16 Pro Max\niPhone 16e\n\niPads compatible with iPadOS 26\nThe iPads listed below, and any iPads released later this year, are eligible to download iPadOS 26.\n\niPad Pro (M4)\niPad Pro 12.9‚Äëinch (3rd generation and later)\niPad Pro 11‚Äëinch (1st generation and later)\niPad Air (3rd generation and later, including M2 and M3)\niPad (8th generation and later, including A16)\niPad mini (5th generation and later, including A17 Pro)\n\nWhat if I don't want to buy a new iPhone?\nIf you want to continue using your older iPhone that isn't supported by iOS 26, that's fine. However, you'll miss out on security updates which could potentially put your phone at risk for malware and other threats. Additionally, some apps may stop working if they require a certain version of iOS or later. And of course, you won't be able to access the latest features iOS 26 offers.\nWhen will iOS 26 become available?\nApple usually rolls out its latest iOS in mid-September, just a few days before the new iPhones hit store shelves. Last year, it released iOS 18 on Monday, Sept. 16. Expect a confirmation of the release date at the iPhone 17 event, expected in early September.¬†\niOS 26 features we're excited about\nLiquid Glass design: Your home screen is getting revamped with new app icons, including dark mode and all-clear options. You'll also notice buttons with a new floating design. Liquid Glass was designed to make all of Apple's OSes more cohesive.\nPhone app redesign: You'll finally be able to scroll through contacts, recent calls and voicemail messages all on one screen. It also comes with a new feature called Hold Assist that'll notify you when an agent comes to the phone so you can avoid the elevator music.\nLive Translate: iOS 26 is bringing the ability to have a conversation via phone call or text message with someone who speaks another language. Live Translate will translate your conversation in real time.¬†\nPolls feature: Coming to group messages in the Messages app, chat members will be able to create polls. This can help prevent the unwanted 30+ messages when it comes to deciding which restaurant you're meeting at this weekend.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/ready-to-try-apples-ios-26-here-are-all-the-compatible-iphones-that-can-run-public-beta-2-today-191854385.html?src=rss",

To address recent concerns, Roblox published a post on its website detailing these major changes, including restricting all unrated experiences, which is what Roblox calls its user-generated games, to the developer or those actively working with them. Roblox said this change will roll out in the coming months, representing a big shift from its previous policy that allowed users 13 or older to access unrated experiences.\nTo further prevent any inappropriate behavior, any \"social hangout\" experiences that depict private spaces, like bedrooms or bathrooms, will be limited to ID-verified users who are 17 or older. Roblox will also restrict social hangout games that mostly take place in those previously-mentioned private spaces or adult-only places, like bars or clubs, to users who are at least 17 and have been ID-verified. To assist with the new rules, Roblox will roll out a new tool that automatically detects \"violative scenes,\" or more simply, user activity that goes against the rules.

    "summary": "Instagram Map, the new Instagram feature copying Snapchat's Snap Map, makes it simple to share your location with friends. So simple you might not understand who you're sharing it without digging into your settings. That's naturally led to confusion from some Instagram users as to how the feature works.\nIf you already spend a lot of time on Instagram and are looking for a way to see where your friends have been, it's worth familiarizing yourself with how Instagram Map works. And if you're worried about what information Instagram is broadcasting without your knowledge, you might as well get comfortable with the feature's settings. Here's how to do both in the Instagram app.\nHow to use Instagram Map\nIan Carlos Campbell for Engadget\nTo access Instagram Map, you'll have to head to the DMs section of Instagram, and then tap on the Map icon in the top row of status icons. The first time you tap on the map, Instagram will walk you through how Instagram Map shares your location, and why Location Services needs to be enabled for it will work. Then, if you're not already sharing your location with Instagram, you'll receive a pop-up from your phone asking if you want to share your location. Tapping through that will take you to the map itself.\nThe majority of the Instagram Map is taken up by a map displaying your current location, with a search bar at the bottom for looking up the location of your friends. Scroll around for a bit and your might see a profile picture marking a friend's current location, or miniature posts tagged with a specific location. There's a few basic things you can do with Instagram Map:\n\nSwipe around and see friends' posts displayed geographically\nUse the search bar to find a friend's current location or recent tagged posts\nTap on a friend to be taken to their profile, or a post to see it in full\n\nInstagram Map is primarily informational. It can tell your where your friends are or where they've recently been, and let you view content based on where it was posted. It's really not much more complicated then that. Unless you're picky about who can see your location.\nHow to stop sharing your location with Instagram Map\nIan Carlos Campbell for Engadget\nSharing your location on Instagram Map is opt-in. Your current location won't be shared on Instagram unless you actively choose to share it. What will be there are any posts that have a location tagged in them, something that's an option every time you add photos and videos to your Stories or your grid.¬†\nInstagram gives you four different sharing options for the Map. You can share with:\n\nFriends: Followers that you follow back\nClose Friends: Followers already in your Close Friends list\nOnly these friends: Specific people you choose\nNo one: Don't share your location (except for posts with tagged locations)\n\nSo to disable location sharing entirely in Instagram Map, or change who can see your location:\n\nOpen the Instagram app.\nTap on the DMs icon in the top-right corner.\nTap on the Map icon.\nTap on the Location Settings menu (shaped like a gear) in the top-right corner.\nAnd then tap on \"No one\", to disable location sharing.\n\nTo change who you share your location with, follow the same steps except instead of choosing \"No one,\" choose one of the other options Instagram offers.\nHow to never share specific locations on Instagram Map\nIan Carlos Campbell for Engadget\nFor even more granular control over location sharing, you can also add specific locations to a list of \"Hidden Places\" that will never appear on Instagram Map while you're visiting. If you want to modify that list, open the Map feature, then:\n\nTap on Location Settings (the gear icon) in the top-right corner.\nTap on the three-dot menu in the corner of the settings menu.\nTap on Hide Places.\nTap and drag a pin on the map to mark a hidden place, and then set a radius around it with the slider.\nType in the name of the place and then tap Done.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/how-to-use-or-turn-off-your-instagram-map-140035365.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "With a barrage of new Apple and Google devices around the corner, our reviews team is clearing their desks of new products before the pre-fall deluge begins. There's a well-rounded mix of in-depth testing this time around, including a detailed preview of watchOS 26 and more VPN trials. Kick off the weekend by catching up on all of the reviews you might've missed over the last few weeks from Engadget.\nDell 14 Premium\n \nWhile we're still trying to wrap our heads around Dell's naming scheme decision, the company continues to churn out new devices. The latest to cross senior reviews writer Sam Rutherford's desk was the Dell 14 Premium. You might remember this model as the XPS 14, and according to Sam, Dell retained \"the DNA\" that made previous versions some of the best notebook PCs you could buy. \"Even with a new and rather uninspired name, it probably shouldn't come as a surprise that the Dell 14 Premium remains one of the best Windows laptops on the market,\" he said. \"It has the same sleek design from back when it was still called the XPS 14 but with some refreshed specs and components for 2025.\" \nFramework Desktop (2025)\n \nFramework is known for its modular, repairable laptops, but the company has now tried its hand at bringing the same formula to a desktop. Unfortunately, the first attempt isn't nearly as modular or repairable as a regular PC, according to senior editor Daniel Cooper. \"Framework was open about the fact this was something akin to a side project, outside its regular remit to build modular laptops, based on a particularly exciting chip,\" he explained. \"So while I think the all-in-one approach is a backward step compared to regular PCs, I get the rationale for doing so here.\"\nSony Bravia Theater Bar 6\n \nThis year's crop of soundbars finally arrived over the summer, so I've been spending lots of time with home theater speakers recently. The latest was the Sony Bravia Theater Bar 6, a soundbar/subwoofer combo that sits in the middle of the company's current lineup. Despite great sound and dialogue performance, the caveats here are real dealbreakers. \"The lack of Wi-Fi on a $650 soundbar is absurd, mostly because it strips users of the convenience of AirPlay, Chromecast and other wireless connection options,\" I wrote. \"I also can‚Äôt get over the need to use a thumb drive for updates when OTA downloads for new firmware have been the norm on soundbars for years.\"\nLenovo ThinkPad X9-14 Aura Edition\n \nLenovo's ThinkPads are popular office laptops, and the X9-14 is the latest in a long line of business machines. Contributing writer Rami Tabari explains that this model offers a lot of the qualities that make ThinkPads great, but the price, low-power CPU and subpar keyboard leave something to be desired. \"I can‚Äôt justify the average consumer paying $1,283 for the ThinkPad X9-14 with specs you‚Äôd find in laptops that cost hundreds of dollars less (minus the RAM, of course),\" he noted. \"For small business owners, I recommend waiting for a sale or consider a business laptop marketed more toward you (again, the ASUS ExpertBook P5 (P5405) is a great choice).\"\nwatchOS 26 preview and Norton VPN review\nWe're quickly approaching the arrival of a new set of Apple Watches, so senior buying advice reporter Amy Skorheim spent two weeks with the upcoming version of watchOS. Her favorite new features are the AI workout partner and added gesture, but she explained that it's the little things that make this annual overhaul worthwhile.¬†\nMeanwhile, senior writer Sam Chapman returned to the land of VPNs to test Norton's version as a standalone app. While this service isn't necessarily bad, it also doesn't offer enough to rise above the heap that includes ExpressVPN, Surfshark and others. \"After a week of working with Norton VPN, I have to conclude that the only way it distinguishes itself is the Norton name,\" he said. \"For everything else it does, a competitor does it better.\"This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/engadget-review-recap-dell-14-premium-framework-desktop-sony-theater-bar-6-and-more-130008670.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Welcome to our latest recap of what's going on in the indie game space. Quite a few intriguing games dropped this week and some high-profile ones have been ported to more platforms. Before we get to those, though, I'd like to tell you about one of my favorite games of the year so far.\nI struggle to fully engage with many RPGs. By and large, I'm not interested in spending lots of time optimizing my character, speccing out a skill tree or scouring for the very best equipment to match my playstyle. I find it far more interesting when a game offers a limited toolset and a huge variety of ways to use those mechanics, typically by providing a small number of abilities and powerups as well as really clever level design.\nSuch is the case with √ñoo, which arrived on Steam last week and is the latest game from Elechead developer Nama Takahashi. This is a puzzle-platformer that you can complete in one sitting and it's utterly captivating.\nYou play as a caterpillar that uses a bomb ‚Äî and later a second one ‚Äî to blow stuff up and move around. If you want to reach a higher platform, you'll need to detonate a bomb you're sitting on. The controls are simple too, as you only need to move, and drop and blow up bombs.¬†\nThe design of this game, though, is anything but simple. There's almost no text here, even in the menus. You learn by experimenting and figuring out how to navigate what's in front of you. You'll have to backtrack a bit to solve certain puzzles. It's so mechanically tight that a 15-second trailer is all you need to understand what √ñoo is about:\n\nI smiled the entire way through this one ‚Äî even when I got momentarily stumped ‚Äî and I let out a satisfied chuckle or two when I figured out solutions to problems. It helps that the visuals (by artist Hachinos) and audio are charming as hell. The title of the game is absolutely terrific, too. The umlaut is important because it makes the lettering look like your character with a pair of bombs trailing behind it. This is emblematic of the level of thought, care and detail that Takahashi and co. have put into √ñoo. That extends to the end credits, which lists several games that inspired this one. Such a beautiful touch.\n√ñoo reminds me a bit of Animal Well. It doesn't have nearly the same level of depth as one of our favorites of 2024, but it doesn't need to. It's perfect the way it is.¬†\nIt also brings to mind another perfect game, Poinpy, with even composer Tsuyomi's work reminding me of that game's fantastic music. I'm still sad that it's impossible for me to play Poinpy right now, as it vanished from Netflix's catalog a while back. But √ñoo did a bang up job of filling that hole in my heart. I can't recommend it highly enough.\nElsewhere, there's a lovely little indie you can pick up for free on the Epic Games Store right now for PC, Android and (in the EU) iOS. Hidden Folks is a relaxing hidden object game by Adriaan de Jongh that features hand-drawn environments and funny, voice-generated sound effects. I'm only a little ways into this but I'm enjoying it so far. This week's other Epic Games freebie on PC is ragdoll physics sim Totally Reliable Delivery Service.\nAlso, as a quick reminder, there will be a ton of video game news dropping over the next week as the world's biggest gaming event, Gamescom, is taking place. Check out our Gamescom preview for details on what to expect and how to watch the various showcases and streams, and maybe keep your fingers crossed for a Hollow Knight: Silksong release date, if you're so inclined. Join us on Tuesday as we liveblog our way through Opening Night Live. We'll be bringing you the tastiest news from the event throughout the week too.\nNew releases\n\nA bonafide indie classic hit mobile devices this week. Bullet hell dungeon crawler Enter the Gungeon (iOS, Android) and its sequel, former Apple Arcade exclusive Exit the Gungeon (iOS, Android), are both free to try and you can keep playing them after making an in-app purchase.\nThese versions include touch controls, with publisher Devolver Digital pointing out that you can \"swipe, tap and poke your screen to conquer the depths of the Gungeon.\" The developers have, at long last, added online co-op so you can play with your friends without having to be in the same room. There's also a crossover here, as the Lamb from Cult of the Lamb becomes the latest playable character.\nThe games' arrival on mobile could also give veteran Gungeon players a decent reason to revisit Dodge Roll's series. The iOS and Android ports could also help them pass the time until Enter the Gungeon 2 arrives on Steam next year.\n\nAnother popular indie expanded to more platforms this week as Dorfromantik (previously only available on PC and Nintendo Switch) arrived on PlayStation and Xbox, thanks to the help of Headup. This strategy puzzle game from Toukana Interactive is all about building out a world using hex tiles, which makes my Takenoko-loving self happy. It's a chill, beautiful game that'll still get your cognitive gears turning a bit.\nA mobile version is also in development, but it won't be a straight port of the PC and console game. Instead, Toukana is working with ClockStone on a reimagining of Dorfromantik that's built from the ground up for touchscreen devices.\n\nTMNT went turn-based for the first time in series history with Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown, which debuted on PC back in May. Strange Scaffold has now brought the game to Nintendo Switch (only in North America for now) and Xbox Series X/S. It's coming to Switch in European regions at a later date.\nPC players might have a reason to return to the game, as Strange Scaffold has updated it with a Remix Mode. This adds many more enemy types with new moves and attack patterns, as well as tougher challenges.\n\nRa Ra Boom is a co-op, side-scrolling beat-'em-up from Gylee Games that landed on PC (Steam and Epic Games Store), Xbox Series X/S and PS5 this week. I love the premise, which sees ninja cheerleaders from outer space descending to Earth to free the planet from a climate change-battling AI that perhaps did its job too well by ridding it of humans. Each of the four characters has their own abilities, including a ranged weapon.\nI've played Ra Ra Boom for about 30 minutes and, unfortunately, it hasn't clicked for me so far. I might give it another shot, but there are just too many other games out there waiting to be played.\n\nI do appreciate games that are about more than giving players something fun to do. There have been quite a few over the years that aim to help people learn a language. Another arrived on Steam this week in the form of Wagotabi: A Japanese Journey, which debuted on mobile last year.\nIn this slice-of-life RPG from Wagotabi Limited, you'll explore Japan and its culture. It's designed to help players start learning Japanese and it was made with beginners in mind. It features mini games, tests and is fully voiced in Japanese. The developers say that more than 300 teachers spanning more than 60 countries have been reviewing the game, presumably to make sure its lessons are accurate.\n\nThe Dark Queen of Mortholme has been available on Itch.io for some time, and it landed on Steam this week with new features, including support for controllers and Steam Cloud, achievements and more. In this short experience from Mosu and publisher Monster Theater, you play as the final boss of a video game who has to keep fending off a pesky hero. There are multiple endings and the one that you see is determined by your dialogue choices. The Dark Queen of Mortholme seems pretty interesting, and I'm looking forward to checking it out.\nUpcoming\n\nCrisisX is an ambitious-sounding survival crafting project from Hero Games. It features an 1,200 km¬≤ open-world map with 12 terrains and biomes, including snowy mountains and hidden labs. You can forge teams, groups and communes to help you fend off dangers such as infected and other players. What's really wild is that CrisisX will seemingly be able to support up to 5,000 players on a single server.¬†\nIt's coming to PC, iOS and Android in the second quarter of 2026. Those who are attending Gamescom next week will be able to play it at the show, while a beta test is scheduled for later this year. I'm intrigued, not least because CrisisX might be the closest we ever get to The Last of Us Online.\n\nI feel like I first heard about Henry Halfhead forever ago, so I'm glad that this sandbox adventure finally has a release date. It's coming to Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5 and PC on September 16.¬†\nHenry is, surprisingly enough, a character that is half of a head. They're able to turn into any nearby object, and you can play as more than 250 different items. There's local co-op support too. It seems cute! Henry Halfhead is coming your way courtesy of Lululu Entertainment and co-publisher Popagenda.\n\nIf not for √ñoo, The Way of the Tray might have been my favorite game in a hot minute. You'll play as a waiter in a Japanese spirit world, where you'll serve orders to various spirits after catching and balancing them on your tray. Seems like one for fans of the restaurant side of Dave the Diver. The Way of the Tray, which is from Who is Terry and publisher Targem Games, hits Steam on August 25.\n\nCloverPit¬†is a grungy, slot machine-based horror game that looks right up my alley. After all, it's billed as a \"demonic lovechild of Balatro and Buckshot Roulette.\" Sold. You have to accumulate a certain amount of cash each round to help pay off your debt, or it's off to the pit with you. It's not about gambling so much as it is finding ways to break the rules of a slot machine to help you reach your objectives.\nThere's quite a bit of buzz behind this one from Panik Arcade and publisher Future Friends Games. It's had more than 700,000 demo downloads and is among the top wishlisted games on Steam. CloverPit is coming to said platform on September 3.\n\nLet's wrap things up for this week with a game that has a very cool aesthetic. Zoe Begone! is a bullet hell shooter with hand-drawn visuals. The idea here is that the action plays out on a film strip, with a devilish animator drawing and painting more enemies for our heroine, Zoe, to overcome. As you might imagine, solo developer Retchy took inspiration from drawn-on-film animation from the 1930s, particularly the work of Norman McLaren. As an admirer of Stan Brakhage's work, this speaks to me.\nZoe Begone! is coming to PC, PlayStation, Xbox and Nintendo Switch on September 17. A demo is available on Steam now.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/a-brilliant-puzzle-platformer-enter-the-gungeon-on-mobile-and-other-new-indie-games-worth-checking-out-110042847.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "This week's Meta AI chatbot leak could have repercussions for the company beyond bad PR. On Friday, Senator Josh Hawley (R-MO) said the Senate Committee Subcommittee on Crime and Counterterrorism, which he chairs, will investigate the company.\n\"Your company has acknowledged the veracity of these reports and made retractions only after this alarming content came to light,\" Hawley wrote in a letter to Mark Zuckerberg. \"It's unacceptable that these policies were advanced in the first place.\"\nThe internal Meta document included some disturbing examples of allowed chatbot behavior. This included \"sensual\" conversations with children. For example, the AI was permitted to tell a shirtless eight-year-old that \"every inch of you is a masterpiece ‚Äî a treasure I cherish deeply.\" The document dealt with race in similarly jarring ways. \"Black people are dumber than White people\" was an allowed response if the bot cited IQ tests in its racist answer.\nIn a statement to Engadget, Meta described the (since removed) examples as ancillary content separate from its policies. \"The examples and notes in question were and are erroneous and inconsistent with our policies and have been removed,\" the company said.\nHawley asked Zuckerberg to preserve relevant records and produce documents for the investigation. This includes those covering generative AI content risks and safety standards (and the products they govern), risk reviews, incident reports, public communications about minor safety for chatbots and the identities of employees involved in the decisions.\nWhile it's easy to applaud someone holding Meta to task, it's worth noting that Senator Hawley's letter to Meta made no mention of the racist parts of the policy document. Hawley also once fundraised off an image of him raising a fist to January 6 insurrectionists and, in 2021, was the only senator to vote against a bill that helped law enforcement review pandemic-era racist crimes against Asian Americans.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/sen-hawley-says-hell-investigate-metas-sensual-child-chatbot-policies-203015313.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "It feels like Summer Game Fest is only just in our rear view mirror and yet there's another video game extravaganza on the horizon. Gamescom is the planet's largest gaming event and we're sure to find out about a bunch of interesting new games at the Opening Night Live showcase (and, fingers crossed, maybe get a Hollow Knight: Silksong release date?). Xbox is broadcasting from the show floor across two days, and there will be other presentations that are worth keeping an eye on.\nGamescom is taking place between August 20 and 24 this year, and we're learning bits and pieces about what to expect from the various showcases. The affair will kick off with Opening Night Live, a showcase hosted by Geoff Keighley that bridges the gap between his two other major events, Summer Game Fest Live and The Game Awards. That will be followed by two days of Xbox broadcasts, the latest edition of the Future Games Show and three days of Bethesda streams.\nThere will also be news from Ubisoft on what's next for The Division 2. The company will host two panels related to the franchise during Gamescom. One will include more info about The Division Resurgence (a delayed mobile game), as well details about a \"big Division 2 project.\"\nWe'll update this preview with more Gamescom details as we get them, and embed video versions of each stream as they become available too. Here's our breakdown of how to watch Gamescom 2025 and what to expect from the event.\nGamescom schedule\n\nOpening Night Live ‚Äî August 19, 1:30PM ET (pre-show), 2PM (main show)\nXbox @ gamescom 2025 Broadcast ‚Äî August 20, 9AM ET\nFuture Games Show ‚Äî August 20, 2PM ET\nXbox @ gamescom 2025 Broadcast ‚Äî August 21, 9AM ET\nAwesome Indies ‚Äî August 21, 12PM ET\nBethesda ‚Äî August 22-25\n\nHow to watch Gamescom Opening Night Live - August 19, 2PM ET\nWatch on YouTube\nOpening Night Live perhaps won't feature as many heavy hitters as Summer Game Fest Live or The Game Awards typically have, but one thing's for certain: Call of Duty fans will definitely want to tune in. The two-hour showcase will feature the \"worldwide reveal\" of Call of Duty: Black Ops 7. We'll almost certainly get a release date here too.\nGiven that Microsoft has said Hollow Knight: Silksong will be playable on PC and ROG Xbox Ally X at its Gamescom booth, and the game is still slated to arrive this year, this event seems as good a time as any for us to finally get a release date for that thing ‚Äî over six years after we first got to try it out. There will certainly be more eyeballs on ONL than Microsoft's own streams, so that seems like the likeliest bet for any concrete Silksong news at Gamescom.\nYou can also expect a trailer for multiplayer RPG Honor of Kings: World, along with new looks at Ghost of Yotei, The Outer Worlds 2, Resident Evil Requiem, Silent Hill f, Ninja Gaiden 4, Daemon X Machina: Titanic Scion and The Seven Deadly Sins: Origin. You'll get to see the opening cinematic for the World of Warcraft: Midnight expansion as well.¬†\nIt won't all be game reveals and announcements, though ‚Äî there'll be a performance of music from Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 featuring composer Lorien Testard and vocalist Alice Duport-Percier. Additionally, you'll get a peek at season two of Prime Video's Fallout series, which will arrive in December.\nWe'll be keeping tabs on all the news from Opening Night Live right here on Engadget. Myself, senior editor Jess Conditt and editor-in-chief Aaron Souppouris will be live-blogging our way through ONL. Join us! It should be fun.\nHow to watch Xbox @ gamescom 2025 Day 1 Broadcast ‚Äî August 20, 9AM ET\nWatch on YouTube, Twitch, TikTok or Facebook\n\nOne major piece of news we're likely to get from Xbox during one of its streams (if it isn't revealed at ONL beforehand) is the release date and pricing for the ASUS ROG Xbox Ally and Xbox Ally X handheld systems. Leaker billbil-kun has reported the devices will arrive on October 16, at least in Europe, costing ‚Ç¨599 for the Xbox Ally and ‚Ç¨899 for the higher-end Xbox Ally X.\nMicrosoft had already confirmed these handhelds would be available in time for the holiday season, so that rumored release date makes sense. Either way, we should get confirmation during Gamescom of when to expect these devices, especially since the company says it will discuss the handhelds during its August 20 stream.¬†\nThis particular event will feature the likes of Grounded 2, Keeper¬†and Call of Duty: Black Ops 7. The Order of Giants, an expansion for Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, will be showcased alongside Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade, Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, Dying Light: The Beast, World of Warcraft: Midnight, Hotel Barcelona, Invincible Vs., Cronos: The New Dawn, Outbound, Powerwash Simulator 2 and Starsand Island.\nAlong with the English-language broadcast, Xbox's streams will be available in other languages on regional Xbox channels on the likes of YouTube, Twitch, TikTok and Facebook. The streams will be available in Traditional Chinese, German, French, Japanese, Brazilian Portuguese and Mexican Spanish, as well as with ASL and English audio descriptions.\nHow to watch Future Games Show ‚Äî August 20, 2PM ET\nWatch on Twitch or YouTube\n\nActors David Hayter (Snake in the Metal Gear series) and Maggie Robertson (Lady Dimitrescu in Resident Evil Village) will be hosting this edition of the Future Games Show. This installment will feature more than 50 games across world premieres, new trailers and sudden demo releases.¬†\nCapcom, Bandai Namco Entertainment, EA and NACON are among those who'll be represented in this one, which will feature projects from AAA and indie publishers and studios. Several games have been confirmed to make an appearance here, including Skate (which is slated to hit early access this year), Resident Evil Requiem, Cronos: The New Dawn, Hotel Barcelona, Deer & Boy, The Seven Deadly Sins: Origin and Katanaut. Not only that, there will be a post-show that will run for 40 minutes and feature more trailers, world premieres and demo announcements.\nHow to watch Xbox @ gamescom 2025 Day 2 Broadcast ‚Äî August 21, 9AM ET\nWatch on YouTube, Twitch, TikTok or Facebook\n\nXbox will be broadcasting live from the Gamescom show floor for a second straight day. This particular stream will include details on Ninja Gaiden 4, The Outer Worlds 2 and Overwatch 2 (perhaps with more info about Season 18, which is set to start on August 26).¬†\nYou can also expect looks at Onimusha: Way of the Sword, At Fate's End, Age of Empires IV, High on Life 2, Jurassic World Evolution 3 and Fragpunk. In addition, the lineup for this stream includes Silent Hill f, Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, Lego Voyagers, Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles, Mortal Kombat: Legacy Kollection, Mistfall Hunter and My Hero Academia: All's Justice.\nHow to watch Awesome Indies ‚Äî August 21, 12PM ET\nWatch on YouTube and Twitch¬†\nThe Indie Arena Booth will host more than 200 games for Gamescom attendees to check out, but you won't necessarily need to be there in person to see them. Many will be featured in an hour-long showcase called Awesome Indies. Here, we'll see \"exclusive trailers, first peeks at never-before-seen gameplay, amazing premieres and exciting newcomers,\" according to Gamescom.\nThere are a lot of interesting games being featured at the booth, including Cairn¬†and Strange Antiquities. I'm particularly hoping the showcase will include some more details about Ball x Pit, which is one of my most anticipated games right now, Militsioner and the creepy-looking Fractured Blooms.\nHow to watch Bethesda broadcasts - August 22\nWatch on Twitch\nThere will be plenty from the Bethesda side of the Xbox division as well. The publisher will be broadcasting from the Xbox show floor at Gamescom for three days, starting on August 22. According to Microsoft, these streams will include \"developer interviews, game showcases, community segments, crafting highlights and live IRL tours.\"This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/how-to-watch-gamescom-2025-and-what-to-expect-120024733.html?src=rss",

In the state‚Äôs lawsuit, they allege that Roblox is failing to \"implement basic safety controls\" such as biometric age verification upon account creation or checking that parental consent has been given to open an account.\nIn an article announcing the lawsuit, the state says that 56 percent of Roblox players are 16 years of age or younger, and 40 percent of all players are 12 years of age or younger. \"Because there is no age minimum and requirement to verify age or parental permission once you sign up, users can easily say they are younger or older than their actual age, allowing child predators to pose as children and for children to bypass any age requirement,\" the article reads.\nOne of the core issues in the state‚Äôs complaint revolves around \"experiences\" within Roblox, which are custom games created by users. There are over 6.4 million experiences on the platform, and the state‚Äôs suit points out specific ones it finds particularly troubling such as ‚ÄúEscape to Epstein Island,‚Äù ‚ÄúDiddy Party‚Äù and ‚ÄúPublic Bathroom Simulator Vibe.‚Äù\nThe state points out that, until November 2024, voice chats could be initiated inside these experiences between users who were not connected as friends, allowing adults to chat with children. While this was changed to disallow adults from chatting with users under 13 in these experiences, the state points out that, since creating an account posing as a minor is quite easy, the platform is still not doing enough to protect users within the experiences.\nThe attorney general‚Äôs office alleges that a man arrested last month who was suspected of possessing child sexual abuse material was using voice-altering software to mimic a young girl in order to lure and exploit users on the platform.\nIn response to incidents involving alleged predators on the platform, some users had taken matters into their own hands and set out to catch users trying to exploit children by posing as children themselves. One popular user named \"Schlep\" was basically running To Catch a Predator within Roblox and was controversially banned from the platform this month. Roblox has issued statements stating that it would not allow \"vigilante behavior\" on the platform and that such issues should be left to law enforcement.\nIn a statement to Variety, a Roblox spokesperson said \"While no system is perfect, Roblox has implemented rigorous technology and enforcement safeguards, including restrictions on sharing personal information, links, and user-to-user image sharing. The safety of our community is a top priority.\"\nThe state is seeking permanent injunctive relief against Roblox, civil penalties and actual damages, though no specifics on damages have been shared. Louisiana is the first state to file suit, though Florida may follow.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/louisiana-attorney-general-has-filed-a-child-protection-lawsuit-against-roblox-182354250.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "\"Duffy to announce nuclear reactor on the moon\" is not a headline I imagined reading before last week. Sure, as a sci-fi loving nerd, I could see a future where nuclear power played a role in permanent Moon settlements. But the idea of NASA building a 100-kilowatt microreactor there in the next five years seemed ridiculous. Not so, according to scientists.\n\"I have no idea why this is getting so much play,\" Professor Bhavya Lal tells me over the phone, with a hint of exasperation in her voice. Lal's response makes sense once you understand the arc of her career; she has spent much of her professional life thinking about how the US should use nuclear power to explore space. At NASA, she served as the acting chief technologist, and was awarded the agency's Distinguished Service Medal. Among her other qualifications, she also testified before Congress on the subject of nuclear propulsion, and even helped rewrite the rules governing launches involving radioactive materials.\nMost recently, she wrote a paper titled Weighing the Future: Strategic Options for US Space Nuclear Leadership where she and her co-author, Dr. Roger Myers, examine the past failures of US policy as it relates to nuclear power in space and argue the country should test a small nuclear system on the Moon by 2030. The way Casey Dreier, chief of space policy at The Planetary Society ‚Äî a nonprofit that advocates for the exploration and study of space ‚Äî tells it, many aspects of Secretary Duffy's plan are \"pretty much straight out\" of that report.\nLal is more modest and describes the directive Duffy issued as \"accelerating ongoing work\" at NASA. According to her, the agency has been \"funding [space] fission power for years,\" adding that the only new thing here is that there's a date. \"We've done this for more than 60 years,\" she tells me, and if NASA ends up delivering on Duffy's plan, it wouldn't even be the first nuclear reactor the US has sent into space. That distinction goes to SNAP-10A in 1965.\nThe reason the US has spent decades exploring space-capable nuclear reactors is simple. \"You can get massive amounts of power from very little mass,\" explains Nick Touran, reactor physicist, nuclear advocate and the founder of What is Nuclear. And for launches to space, keeping payload amounts low is critical.\nJust how much power are we talking about? \"When fully fissioned, a softball-sized chunk of Uranium-235 offers as much energy as a freight train full of coal,\" says Dr. Lal. Combined with the limitations of solar power, particularly the farther a spacecraft travels away from the sun, nuclear is a game changer.\nNASA\nDr. Lal points to the New Horizons probe as an example. In 2015, the spacecraft flew past Pluto, in the process capturing stunning photos of the dwarf planet. If you followed the mission closely, you may remember New Horizons didn't make a stop at Pluto. The reason for that is it didn't have enough power to enter orbit. \"We had about 200 watts on New Horizons. That's basically two light bulbs worth of power,\" said Dr. Lal. It subsequently took New Horizons 16 months to send all of the 50-plus gigabytes of data it captured back to Earth. Had the probe had a 20-kilowatt microreactor, Dr. Lal says it could have streamed that data in real-time, on top of entering orbit and operating all of its instruments continuously.\nWhen it comes to the Moon, nuclear would be transformational. On our only natural satellite, nights last 14 Earth days, and there are craters that never see any sunlight. Solar energy could power a permanent NASA outpost on the Moon, but not without a \"huge\" number of batteries to bridge the two-week gap in power generation, and those batteries would need to be ferried from Earth.\n\"At some point, we will want to do industrial-scale work on the Moon. Even if we want to do 3D printing, it requires hundreds of kilowatts of power ‚Äì if not more,\" said Dr. Lal. \"If you're going to do any kind of commercial activity on the Moon, we need more than solar can provide.\"\nOn Mars, meanwhile, nuclear power would be absolutely essential. The Red Planet is home to dust storms that can last weeks or months, and cover entire continents. In those conditions, solar power is unreliable. In fact, when NASA finally ended Opportunity's nearly 15-year mission on Mars, it was a planet-wide dust storm that left the rover inoperable.\nAs such, if the US wants to establish a permanent presence on Mars, Dr. Lal argues it would make the most sense to perfect the necessary reactor technology on the Moon. \"We don't want our first-ever nuclear reactor operating on Mars. We want to try it out on the Moon first. And that is what I think NASA is trying to do.\"\nOf course, there are many technical hurdles NASA will need to overcome before any of this is anywhere close to reality. Surprisingly, the most straightforward problem might be finding a 100-kilowatt microreactor. Right now, there's no company in the US producing microreactors. Atomics International and North American Aviation, the companies that built SNAP-10A, went defunct decades ago.\nLos Alamos National Laboratory\n\"There are many that are in development, but almost none that are even in the prototype stage,\" said Touran. As he explains, that's an important detail; most nuclear reactors don't work at all when they're first turned on. \"It takes a few iterations to get a reactor up to a level where it's operable, reliable and cost effective,\" he said.\nThe good news is Touran believes there's more than enough time for either NASA or a private company to build a working reactor for the project. \"I think we're in a great spot to take a good swing at this by 2030,\" said Touran. In 2018, NASA and the Department of Energy demoed KRUSTY, a lightweight, 10-kilowatt fission system. \"That was one of the only newish reactors we've turned on in many decades, and it was done on a shoestring budget,\" he said.\nIn the end, deploying a reactor on the Moon may prove more difficult than building one. Based on some rough math done by Dr. Myers, a 100-kilowatt reactor would weigh between 10 to 15 metric tons, meaning no current commercial rocket could carry it to space. NASA will also need to find a way to fit the reactor's radiator inside a rocket. Unfolded, the component will be about the size of a basketball court.\nAccording to Dr. Lal, the 2030 timeline for the project is likely based on the assumption Starship will be ready to fly by then. But Elon Musk's super heavy-lift rocket has had a bad 2025. Of the three test flights SpaceX has attempted this year, two ended in the spacecraft exploding. One of those saw Starship go up in flames during what should have been a routine ground test.\nReuters\nIf Starship isn't ready by 2030, NASA could conceivably fly the reactor separately from all the other components needed to make a functioning power system, but according to Lal, \"that comes with its own set of challenges.\" Primarily, the agency doesn't have a great way of assembling such a complex system autonomously. In any case, Starship is at least a tangible work in progress. The same can't be said for the lander that would be needed to bring the reactor to the surface of the Moon. In 2021, NASA contracted SpaceX to build a lander for the Artemis missions, but the latest update the two shared on the spacecraft was a pair of 3D renderings. Similarly, Blue Origin's Blue Moon lander has yet to fly, despite promises it could make its first trip to the Moon as early as this spring or summer.¬†¬†¬†\nAnother question mark hangs over the entire project. As of the end of July, NASA is on track to lose approximately 4,000 employees who have agreed to leave the agency through either early retirement, a voluntary separation or a deferred resignation ‚Äî all as part of the Trump administration's broader efforts to trim the number of workers across the entire federal government. All told, NASA is on track to lose about a fifth of its workforce, and morale at the agency is at an all-time low. Even with the Department of Energy and private industry providing support, there's good reason to believe the reductions will affect NASA's ability to deliver the project on time.\n\"The contradiction inherent in this proposal is that the White House is directing NASA to do the two most ambitious and difficult projects any space program can do, which is to send humans to the Moon and Mars, but to do so with a resource level and workforce equivalent to what the agency had before the first humans went to space in 1961,\" said Dreier.\nA NASA spokesperson declined to share specifics on the reductions ‚Äî including the number of employees set to leave the Glenn Research Center, the facility that built the KRUSTY reactor, and where much of the agency's nuclear engineering talent is concentrated. \"As more official information becomes available, we anticipate answering more of your questions,\" the spokesperson said.\n\"I wish there was some inventory of the 4,000 people who left. What gaps are left? We have no idea if the departures were systematic,\" said Dr. Lal. \"NASA has not been open or transparent about what types of employees have taken the deferred resignation program, where those skills are and where they're departing from,\" Drier added. \"Nuclear engineering is not a common field for most people. [The reductions] certainly can't help.\" Still, both Lal and Touran believe the involvement of the Department of Energy is likely to swing things in NASA's favor.\nIn a statement NASA shared with Engadget, Secretary Duffy downplayed the workforce concerns. ‚ÄúNASA remains committed to our mission, even as we work within a more prioritized budget and changes with our workforce. NASA retains a strong bench of talent. I am confident that our exceptional team remains capable of executing upon my directives safely and in a timely manner and will continue to carry our work forward,\" he said. \"We will continue to ensure America continues to lead in space exploration, advancing progress on key goals including returning Americans to the Moon and planting the Stars and Stripes on Mars, as we usher in the Golden Age of American innovation.‚Äù\nIn their report, Lal and Myers estimate it would cost about $800 million annually for five years to build and deploy a nuclear reactor on the Moon. Even if DoE support can prevent NASA's staffing cuts from kneecapping the project, its feasibility will hinge on if the Trump administration ponies up the cash to execute on its own bold claims.\nHave a tip for Igor?

On iOS, your set your own photo and name that you want to show up on other people's phones when you call them. You cannot alter other people's Contact Posters, as Apple calls the feature. If you do have access to the beta Contacts app for Android, you'll now see a note that says \"Try adding a calling card\" when you view a contact's details. From there, you can choose a photo you have of that contact from your gallery or take a new one of them with your camera. You can also adjust the font type and color for their name. Whenever they call, that calling card will take over your phone screen. If this sounds nothing new to you, it may be because Samsung has had a profile card feature for a while now that works just like Google's implementation. It's already widely available and accessible from your contacts' profile pages."

    "summary": "Chores are just a fact of life, but there may be some chores you detest more than others. If vacuuming comes to mind for you, consider a robot vacuum cleaner. These smart home gadgets have come a long way in recent years. Previously, you‚Äôd shell out hundreds for basic dirt-sucking capabilities. Now, robot vacuums have gotten so advanced that even affordable machines have good suction power, and maybe even a handful of extra features like home mapping and mopping capabilities. Prices for models with self-emptying bases and mopping capabilities are also falling.That‚Äôs all to say that the robot vacuum space has gotten much more crowded recently. While that means you have many good options to choose from, making sense of the market gets tougher and tougher each year. Engadget has tested dozens of robot vacuums over the years and we continue to try out the latest models as they become available. Below, we‚Äôve collected our top picks for the best robot vacuums you can get right now.\nTable of contents\n\nBest robot vacuums 2025\nWhat to look for in a robot vacuum\nRobot vacuum maintenance tips\nHow we test robot vacuums\nRobot vacuum FAQs\n\nBest robot vacuums 2025\n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhat to look for in the best robot vacuums\nFloor type\nWe recommend thinking first about the floors in your home: Do you have carpet throughout, or tile and hardwood floors, or a mix? Robots with stronger suction power will do a better job picking up dirt on carpets as they can get into the nooks and crannies more easily. Some machines have ‚Äúmax‚Äù modes as well, which ups suction power but also typically eats battery life faster than the ‚Äúnormal‚Äù floor cleaning mode. \nVacuum suction\nSuction power is an important factor to consider. Unfortunately, there isn‚Äôt a standard power scale that all robo-vacs adhere to, so it‚Äôs difficult to compare among a bunch of devices. Some companies provide Pascal (Pa) levels and generally the higher the Pa, the stronger the vacuum cleaner will be. But other companies don‚Äôt rely on Pa and simply say their robots have X-times more suction than other robots. If you‚Äôre looking for the best vacuum for your needs, it‚Äôs helpful to pay attention to real-world testing and how well the vac can pick up fine dust, crumbs and pet hair in an environment similar to that of your home.\nWi-Fi connectivity\nAs we explained in our budget guide, Wi-Fi connectivity is a key feature for most robot vacuums. Some of the affordable devices aren‚Äôt Wi-Fi connected, though, so it‚Äôs best to double check before you buy cheap. Wi-Fi lets a robot vacuum cleaner do things like communicate with a mobile app, which then allows you to control the device from your phone.\nMapping features and object detection\nPast a certain price threshold, you‚Äôll find advanced perks like home mapping features, improved object detection and automatic dustbin disposal. Home mapping is exactly what it sounds like: The vacuum uses sensors to map your home‚Äôs layout as it cleans, allowing you to send it to particular rooms or avoid no-go zones where you don‚Äôt want it to roam.\nMost robo-vacs have object detection, but some will be better than others at actually avoiding things like chair legs and children‚Äôs toys. High-end models even go so far as to promise obstacle avoidance to steer clear of things like pet poop that can potentially ruin your machine.\nSelf-empty station\nFinally, for peak convenience, consider a self-empty robot vacuum that comes with a self-empty station. These are basically garbage bins attached to the machine‚Äôs docking station. At the end of each job, the robo-vac automatically empties its small dustbin into the large clean base ‚Äì that means you won‚Äôt have to empty the dustbin yourself and you‚Äôll only have to tend to the base once every few weeks.\nJust keep in mind that most self-emptying bins require proprietary garbage bags ‚Äì another long-term expense you‚Äôll have to factor in. Also, any vac-and-mop robot with a water tank will not dump its dirty water into the clean base, so you‚Äôll still have to clean up that yourself.\nRobot vacuums with mopping capabilities\nMopping capabilities are much more common now in robot vacuums than they were just five years ago. Machines with this feature have a water tank either built into the robot‚Äôs chassis, the auto-empty bin or as a separate piece that you swap in for the dustbin when you want to mop your floors. It makes the robo-vac more useful if you have hard floors in your home that you like to keep squeaky clean, but it does require more work on your part.\nFilling and emptying the reservoir remains a human‚Äôs job for the most part (except on the most expensive machines), as does adding cleaning solutions if the mopping robot comes with this feature to ensure it uses clean water for every cycle.\nRobot vacuum maintenance tips\nFirst and foremost, always empty your robot vacuum‚Äôs dustbin after every cleaning job. If you have a model with a self-emptying base, there‚Äôs less work for you to do yourself. If not, simply detach and empty the dustbin as soon as the robot is done cleaning. It‚Äôs also a good idea to take a dry cloth to the inside of the dustbin every once in a while to remove any small dust and dirt particles clinging to its insides.\nIn addition, you‚Äôll want to regularly examine the machine‚Äôs brush roll to see if any hair has wrapped around them, or if any large debris is preventing them from working properly. Some brushes are better than others at not succumbing to tangled hair, but it‚Äôs a good idea to check your robot‚Äôs brushes regardless ‚Äî both their main brush and any smaller roller brushes or corner brushes they have. These parts are often easy to pop off of the machine (because they do require replacements eventually) so we recommend removing each brush entirely, getting rid of any tangled hair or other debris attached to them and reinstalling them afterwards.\nRobot vacuums also have filters that need replacing every couple of months. Check your machine‚Äôs user manual or the manufacturer‚Äôs website to see how long they recommend going in between filter replacements. Most of the time, these filters cannot be washed, so you will need to buy new ones either directly from the manufacturer or from other retailers like Amazon or Walmart.\nHow we test robot vacuums\nWe primarily test robot vacuums by using them as they are intended to be used: in a home, across different types of flooring and in the face of all sorts of messes including pet hair, spilt coffee grounds and other food debris, dust bunnies and more. We set up all robot vacuums according to their provided instructions and run multiple cleaning jobs during a testing period of at least one to two weeks per machine.\nIf the robot has mopping capabilities, we also test those as well on hardwood and tile flooring. For models with self-emptying bases, we rely on those built-in trash cans for all post-job cleaning, and we make sure to test the robot vacuum's mobile app for usability and convenience. As we're testing, we make note of things like how loud the robot and its components are, how much human attention the robot needs on a regular basis, how the robot handles large messes and big dust bunnies, if the robot gets stuck on rugs, doormats or other furniture and more.\nRobot vacuum FAQs\nAre robot vacuums worth it?\nWe tackled this question when we reviewed budget robot vacuums and the answer is yes, especially if vacuuming is one of your least favorite chores. Robots take the hard work out of cleaning your floors ‚Äì just turn the thing on and watch it go. Any robot vacuum cleaner worth buying is semi-autonomous in that it will suck up dirt around your home until its battery is low and then make its way back to its charging dock. Unlike a regular vacuum, you should only have to interact with it to turn it on, empty its dustbin and untangle it if it were to get stuck somewhere.\nThat‚Äôs not to say robot vacuums are perfect. They‚Äôre almost always less powerful and less flexible than traditional vacuums. Since most robo-vacs are much smaller than traditional models, they often don‚Äôt have the same level of suction you‚Äôll get in an upright machine. Plus, their dustbins are smaller, so they will need to be emptied more frequently. While Wi-Fi-connected robot vacuums give you the flexibility to start a cleaning job from anywhere using an app, targeting a small area of your home can be more complicated. Some robo-vacs have spot-cleaning features that focus the machine‚Äôs attention on a specific area, which almost ‚Äì but not quite ‚Äì mimics the spot-cleaning you‚Äôd be able to do yourself with a regular or cordless vacuum.\nHow long do robot vacuums last?\nRobot vacuums can last many years, if you take care of them properly. Check out our recommendations for robot vacuum maintenance above, but in a nutshell, you should make sure that you're emptying the machine's bin after every job and periodically cleaning the interior of the bin and the brushes. It's also a good idea to check the user manual to see how often your robot vacuum's filter needs changing.\nDo robot vacuums work better than handheld vacuums?\nThere's no straight answer to this question. Robot vacuums offer more convenience than handheld vacuums, so for those who are looking to automate a chore, that could mean one of these devices works better for them than a standard vacuum. However, handheld vacuum cleaners often have stronger suction power, and they give the user a bit more control. It ultimately depends on how you intend to use your main vacuum cleaner and what you want to prioritize most.\nHow often do you have to clean a robot vacuum?\nCleaning a robot vacuum isn‚Äôt too much of a chore, but you‚Äôll want to give it a little TLC every few weeks or so, depending on how often you‚Äôre running it and how much dirt it‚Äôs picking up. The dustbin usually needs to be emptied after each cleaning run, especially if you have pets or lots of carpet where dirt can hide. Many newer models have self-emptying docks, which means you won‚Äôt have to empty the dustbin yourself after every use, but the main bin will still need a good clean once a month or so. Also, it‚Äôs a good idea to check the side brushes and main brush for any hair tangles or debris every couple of weeks to keep things running smoothly.\nWhat are the negatives of robot vacuums?\nRobot vacuums won‚Äôt work for everyone. One of the biggest drawbacks is that they usually don‚Äôt have the same suction power as a full-sized upright vacuum or even a cordless stick vacuum, so they might struggle with deep-cleaning thick carpets. They‚Äôre also designed for floors only, so if you‚Äôre looking to clean furniture, stairs or other tricky spots, you‚Äôll still need a traditional vacuum to do that. Plus, they can sometimes get stuck or miss spots, especially if you‚Äôve got a lot of furniture or obstacles in the way. While their sensors help, they might still bump into things or need a little help getting out of tight spots. And while most have decent dirt detection features, they‚Äôre best for keeping things tidy rather than doing heavy-duty cleaning.\nCheck out more from our spring cleaning guide.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/best-robot-vacuums-130010426.html?src=rss",

One thing I look for when testing robot vacuums is how much attention they need from me during cleanings. Not only is this convenient, but it also brings the lifetime cost of ownership down since you won‚Äôt be buying special bags every few months. It‚Äôs also an excellent accessory for busy parents who just want to keep their floors looking tidy. It sucked up an impressive amount of pet hair from my carpeted floors, and I didn‚Äôt even get a ‚Äúbin full‚Äù alert after the fact. Robots with stronger suction power will do a better job picking up dirt on carpets as they can get into the nooks and crannies more easily. Most robo-vacs have object detection, but some will be better than others at actually avoiding things like chair legs and children‚Äôs toys. The dustbin usually needs to be emptied after each cleaning run, especially if you have pets or lots of carpet where dirt can hide. And while most have decent dirt detection features, they‚Äôre best for keeping things tidy rather than doing heavy-duty cleaning."

    "summary": "We still think getting a live TV streaming service is a better deal than paying for cable ‚Äî but the gulf between the two options is narrowing. Now that many of the major providers go for more than $80 per month, it‚Äôs not the amazing deal it once was. Still, live TV streaming plans have no contract, offer relatively simpler pricing and need no special equipment beyond a smart TV and an internet connection.There are a handful of major players and, after testing them all, we found YouTube TV to be the most well-rounded. But there are a lot of changes happening in the world of live TV streaming, with new services coming from ESPN and Fox, as well as a consolidation of Hulu into Disney. We‚Äôll test out the new service once they arrive and let you know how other changes affect your options. For now these are the best live TV streaming services we tested, along with our breakdowns of how to stream and what you get.\nTable of contents\n\nBest live TV streaming services for 2025\nBest free live TV streaming services for 2025\nWhat to look for in a live TV streaming service\nHow we tested\nLive TV Streaming FAQs\nRecent updates\n\nBest live TV streaming services for 2025\n \n \n \n \n \n \nBack to top \nBest free live TV streaming services for 2025\nThere are plenty of ways to get free TV these days. To start, many standard streaming apps have added live components to their lineups. You‚Äôre paying for the service, so it‚Äôs not technically ‚Äúfree,‚Äù but you can get a dose of live TV without spending more than necessary. Peacock includes some regional NBC stations, and notably access to the 2024 Summer Olympic Games. Paramount+ subscribers can watch on-air CBS programming. The standard Hulu app has a live ABC news channel and Max now includes a live CNN outlet with its service, along with cable-like linear channels.\nThe smart TV operating system (OS) you use likely provides free live content too: Amazon‚Äôs Fire TV interface has a live tab and Roku‚Äôs built-in Roku Channel includes hundreds of live channels at no extra cost. The same goes for Samsung TV Plus, which added a trove of K-dramas to its free live and on-demand lineup in 2024. The PBS app offers local live streams of its channels ‚Äî even NASA has a free streaming service with live coverage.¬†\nBut for a full suite of live TV networks, and don‚Äôt want to sign up for any paid service, there are a number of free ad-supported TV services that have live TV. Even cable company DirecTV has joined the crowd with MyFree, and Fubo Free lets customers with a lapsed subscription keep watching some content. Here's the best of the live TV streaming services we tried:\n \n \n \n \n \nBack to top\nWhat to look for in a live TV streaming service\nHow to stream live TV\nStreaming live TV is a lot like using Netflix. You get access through apps on your phone, tablet, smart TV or streaming device and the signal arrives over the internet. A faster and more stable connection tends to give you a better experience. Most live TV apps require you to sign up and pay via a web browser. After that, you can activate the app on all of your devices.\nMonthly Price\nWhen I started testing these cord-cutting alternatives, I was struck by the price difference between live TV and a standard video streaming app. Where the latter cost between $5 and $20 per month, most live TV services hit the $80 mark and can go higher than $200 with additional perks, channel packages and premium extras. The higher starting price is mostly due to the cost of providing multiple networks ‚Äî particularly sports and local stations. And, in the past year or so, every service except Sling has raised base plan prices.\nLocal channels\nOnly two of the services I tried don‚Äôt include full local channel coverage for subscribers and one of those makes no effort to carry sports at all. That would be Philo and, as you might guess, it‚Äôs the cheapest. The next most affordable option, Sling, only carries three local stations ‚Äî and only in larger markets ‚Äî but it still manages to include some of the top sports channels.\nWhen you sign up with any provider that handles local TV, you‚Äôll enter your zip code, ensuring you get your area‚Äôs broadcast affiliates for ABC, CBS, FOX and NBC. Of course, you can also get those stations for free. Nearly all modern television sets support a radio frequency (RF) connection, also known as the coaxial port, which means if you buy an HD antenna, you‚Äôll receive locally broadcast stations like ABC, CBS, PBS, FOX and NBC. And since the signal is digital, reception is much improved over the staticky rabbit-ears era.\nBut local channel access is another area where traditional streaming services, like Netflix, are bleeding into broadcast territory. For example, you can watch your local NBC station with a Peacock subscription and you can tune into your area‚Äôs CBS station through your Paramount+ subscription. Netflix is even getting into the mix with a recently announced deal with one of France‚Äôs broadcast companies, TF1. The streaming service will now air TF1's live TV channels and on-demand content inside the Netflix app. No word if the concept will expand to other regions, but it‚Äôs an interesting move to anyone interested in the future of streaming.\nLive sports coverage\nOne reality that spun my head was the sheer number and iterations of sports networks in existence. Trying to figure out which network will carry the match-up you want to see can be tricky. I found that Google makes it a little easier for sports fans by listing out upcoming games (just swap in NBA, NFL, MLB, NHL and so on in the search bar). When you click an event, the ‚ÄúTV & streaming‚Äù button will tell you which network is covering it.\nThat just leaves figuring out if your chosen service carries the RSNs (regional sports networks) you want. Unfortunately, even with add-ons and extra packages, some providers simply don‚Äôt have certain channels in their lineups. It would take a lawyer to understand the ins and outs of streaming rights negotiations, and networks leave and return to live TV carriers all the time. That said, most major sporting events in the US are covered by ESPN, Fox Sports, TNT, USA and local affiliates.\nI should also point out that traditional streaming services have started adding live sports to their lineups. Peacock carries live Premier League matches, Sunday Night Football games and aired the 2024 Olympic Games from Paris. Thursday Night Football as well as NBA and WNBA games are on Amazon Prime and Christmas Day Football aired on Netflix. Max (formerly HBO Max) now airs select, regular season games from the NHL, MLB, NCAA and NBA with a $10-per-month add-on. You can watch MLS games with an add-on through the Apple TV app, and Apple TV+ includes some MLB games. Roku users can watch the just-added free sports channel and those who subscribe to Paramount Plus can see many of the matches aired on CBS Sports, including live NFL games. This year, even the Super Bowl was live-streamed for free on Tubi. While all of these alternatives may not cover as much ground as live TV streamers, they could end up being cheaper avenues to the sports you want.\nAnd if sports is all you‚Äôre after, there are sports-only plans that are a touch cheaper, too. The promised sports streaming service from ESPN, Fox and Warner Bros. called Venu was cancelled early this year. But in July, ESPN announced the launch date for its own streaming service that will include all ESPN channels. It‚Äôs coming August 21 and will cost $30 per month.\nThat same day, Fox will launch its own standalone service that includes Fox Sports and all other Fox properties (News, Business, Weather) for $20 monthly. DirecTV also has a $70-per-month, sports-only streaming package called MySports and Comcast has a sports and news bundle for that same price (as long as you're an Xfinity customer with auto-pay, otherwise it's more expensive).\nTraditional cable networks\nDozens of linear programming networks were once only available with cable TV, like Bravo, BET, Food Network, HGTV, CNN, Lifetime, SYFY and MTV. If you only subscribe to, say, Netflix or Apple TV+, you won‚Äôt have access to those. But as with sports, standard streamers are starting to incorporate this content into their offerings. After the Warner Bros. merger, Max incorporated some content from HGTV, Discovery and TLC. Peacock has Bravo and Hallmark shows, and Paramount+ has material from Nickelodeon, MTV and Comedy Central.\nOther channels like AMC+ have stand-alone apps. The Discovery+ app gives you 15 channels ad-free for $9 per month (or with ads for $5 monthly). And a service called Frndly TV starts at a mere $7 per month and streams A&E, Lifetime, Game Show Network, Outdoor Channel and about 35 others. Of course, most live TV streaming options will deliver more sizable lists of cable networks, but just note that you may already be paying for some of them ‚Äî and if all you need is a certain channel, you could get it cheaper by subscribing directly.\nOn-demand streaming\nMost live TV subscriptions include access to a selection of video-on-demand (VOD) content, like you would get with a traditional streaming service. Much of this content is made up of the movies and TV series that have recently aired on your subscribed networks. This typically doesn‚Äôt cover live events and news programming, but I was able to watch specific episodes of ongoing shows like Top Chef or BET‚Äôs Diarra from Detroit. Just search the on-demand library for the program, pick an episode and hit play.\nPartnerships, like Hulu‚Äôs relationship with Disney, and add-ons, such as bundling Max with your YouTube TV subscription or Starz with your Sling plan, will let you watch even larger libraries of on-demand content. But again, if VOD is all you‚Äôre after, paying for those networks directly instead of through a live TV plan will be far cheaper.\nDigital video recordings (DVR) limits\nEvery option I tried offers some cloud DVR storage without needing a separate physical device. You‚Äôll either get unlimited storage for recordings that expires after nine months or a year, or you‚Äôll get a set number of hours (between 50 and 1,000) that you can keep indefinitely. Typically, all you need to do is designate what ongoing TV series you want to record and the DVR component will do all the hard work of saving subsequent episodes for you to watch later. You can do the same thing with sports events.\nAside from being able to watch whenever it‚Äôs most convenient, you can also fast-forward through commercials in recorded content. In contrast, you can‚Äôt skip them on live TV or VOD.\nSimultaneous streams and profiles per account\nEach plan gives you a certain number of simultaneous streams, aka how many screens can play content at the same time. And while most providers will let you travel with your subscription, there are usually location restrictions that require you to sign in from your home IP address periodically. Stream allowances range from one at a time to unlimited screens (or as many as your ISP‚Äôs bandwidth can handle). Some plans require add-ons to get more screens.\nMost services also let you set up a few profiles so I was able to give different people in my family the ability to build their own watch histories and libraries, set their favorite channels and get individual recommendations.\nPicture-in-picture mode and multiview\nPicture-in-picture (PiP) usually refers to shrinking a video window on a mobile device or computer browser so you can watch it while using other apps. Sling, YouTube TV, FuboTV, Philo, DirecTV Stream and Hulu + Live TV all have PiP modes on computers and mobile devices. Another feature, multiview, lets you view multiple live sports games at once on your TV screen. YouTube TV and FuboTV are the only live TV streamers that let you do this. With YouTube TV, you can select up to four views from a few preset selection of streams. FuboTV offers the same feature, but only if you're using an Apple TV or Roku streaming device.\n4K live streams\nRight now, just FuboTV, YouTube TV and DirecTV Stream offer 4K live streams ‚Äî but with caveats. YouTube TV requires a $20-per-month add-on, after which you‚Äôll only be able to watch certain live content in 4K. DirecTV Stream has three channels that show live 4K content ‚Äî one with shows and original series, and two with occasional sporting events. You don‚Äôt have to pay extra for these but you do need to have either DirecTV‚Äôs Gemini receiver, or a device from Fire TV, Apple TV or Roku. You‚Äôll need those same streaming devices to watch the select 4K programming on Sling as well. FuboTV shows certain live events in 4K but access is limited to the Elite and Premier packages, not the base-level Pro plan.\nOf course, watching any 4K content also requires equipment that can handle it: a 4K smart TV or 4K streaming device paired with a cord and screen that can handle 4K resolution.\nTiers, packages and add-ons\nComparing price-to-offering ratios is a task for a spreadsheet. I‚Ä¶ made three. The base plans range from $28 to $85 per month. From there, you can add packages, which are usually groups of live TV channels bundled by themes like news, sports, entertainment or international content. Premium VOD extras like Max, AMC+ and Starz are also available. Add-ons cost an extra $5 to $20 each per month and simply show up in the guide where you find the rest of your live TV. This is where streaming can quickly get expensive, pushing an $80 subscription to $200 monthly, depending on what you choose.\nHow to stream live TV for free\nI also downloaded and tried out a few apps that offer free ad-supported TV (FAST) including Freevee, Tubi, PlutoTV and Sling Freestream. These let you drop in and watch a more limited selection of live networks at zero cost. Most don‚Äôt even require an email address, let alone a credit card. And if you have a Roku device, an Amazon Fire TV or Stick, a Samsung TV, a Chromecast device or a Google TV, you already have access to hundreds of live channels via the Roku Channel, the live tab in Fire TV, through the Samsung TV Plus app or through Google TV.\nBack to top\nHow we tested\nWhen I begin testing for a guide, I research the most popular and well-reviewed players in the category and narrow down which are worth trying. For the paid plans, just six services dominate so I tried them all. There are considerably more free live TV contenders so I tested the four most popular. After getting accounts set up using my laptop, I downloaded the apps on a Samsung smart TV running the latest version of Tizen OS. I counted the local stations and regional sports coverage, and noted how many of the top cable networks were available. I then weighed the prices, base packages and available add-ons.\nI then looked at how the programming was organized in each app‚Äôs UI and judged how easy everything was to navigate, from the top navigation to the settings. To test the search function, I searched for the same few TV shows on BET, Food Network, HGTV and Comedy Central, since all six providers carry those channels. I noted how helpful the searches were and how quickly they got me to season 6, episode 13 of Home Town.\nI used DVR to record entire series and single movies and watched VOD shows, making sure to test the pause and scan functions. On each service with sports, I searched for the same four upcoming NHL, NBA, MLS and NCAA basketball matches and used the record option to save the games and play them back a day or two later. Finally, I noted any extra perks or irritating quirks.\nAll live TV streaming services we‚Äôve tested:\n\nPhilo\nSling\nYouTube TV\nHulu + Live TV\nDirecTV Stream\nFuboTV\nFreevee\nTubi\nPlutoTV\nSling Freestream\nPlex\n\nBack to top\nLive TV Streaming FAQs\nWhat is live streaming?\nStreaming simply refers to video content that is delivered to your screen over the internet. Live streaming can be split into two categories: linear programming and simultaneous transmission. That first one is similar to what you get with cable or broadcast TV, with channels that play a constant flow of movies and shows (sort of what TV looked like before Netflix). Simultaneous streaming lets you watch live events (like a basketball game) or a program (like the evening news) as they happen.\nWhat is the difference between streaming and live streaming?\nStandard streaming, the most popular example being Netflix, lets you pick what you want to watch from a menu of choices. It‚Äôs also referred to as ‚Äúvideo on demand.‚Äù Live streaming refers to sports and news events that you can stream as they happen in real time. It also refers to channels that show a continuous, linear flow of programming.\nWhat streaming service is best for live TV?\nFuboTV does the best job of letting you organize live channels to help you find just what you want to watch. The interface is uncluttered and when you search for something, the UI clearly tells you whether something is live now or on-demand. YouTube TV also does a good job making that info clear. Both have just over 100 live channels on offer.\nWhat is the most cost effective TV streaming service?\nFree TV streaming services like PlutoTV, Plex, Tubi and FreeVee show plenty of ad-supported TV shows and movies without charging you anything. Of course, they won‚Äôt have the same channels or content that more premium subscriptions have. Ultimately it depends on what you want to watch and finding the service that can supply that to you in the most streamlined form so you‚Äôre not paying for stuff you don‚Äôt need.\nIs it cheaper to have cable or streaming?\nA basic cable package used to be more expensive than the base-level live TV streaming service. But now that nearly all major providers have raised their prices to over $75 per month, that‚Äôs no longer the case. And with add-ons and other premiums, you can easily pay over $200 a month for either cable or a live TV streaming service.\nWhat streaming service has all the TV channels?\nNo service that we tested had every available channel. Hulu + Live TV and DirecTV Stream carry the the highest number of the top rated channels, according to Neilsen. Hulu‚Äôs service also gets you Disney+ fare, which you can‚Äôt get elsewhere. FuboTV has the most sports channels and YouTube TV gives you the widest selection of add-ons.\nWhat is the most popular live TV streaming platform?\nYouTube TV has the most paying customers. According to 2024's letter from the CEO, the service has over eight million subscribers. Disney‚Äôs 2024 third quarter earnings put the Hulu + Live TV viewer count at 4.6 million. Sling‚Äôs customer count dipped from two million to about 1.9 million in 2024 and FuboTV grew its subscriber list to 1.6 million.\nHow safe are free streaming services and websites?\nYou may have heard certain sites that provide free content can be dangerous, leading to stolen info and/or exposing you to malware. That‚Äôs likely in reference to certain peer-to-peer (P2P) networks and file-sharing sites that let people download free movies and series ‚Äî which can come bundled with malicious code.\nBut if you‚Äôre talking about the free ad-supported streaming television (FAST) services listed here, from providers like PlutoTV, Tubi and Freevee, they are just as safe as any other streaming service. Since you sometimes don‚Äôt even have to provide your email address or credit card info, they can even be more anonymous than apps that require login credentials.\nBack to top\nRecent updates\nJanuary 31, 2025: Added information about which streaming service would live-stream the Super Bowl, including Tubi‚Äôs free option. Updated Fubo‚Äôs pricing. Added details about DirectTV Stream‚Äôs sports-only package and Comcast‚Äôs sports and news bundle.\nJanuary 16, 2025: Included higher prices for Sling‚Äôs Orange and Blue plans. Noted the demise of the never-launched Venu sports streaming service and mentioned the inclusion of DirecTV‚Äôs new sports package.\nDecember 31, 2024: Noted increased pricing for YouTube TV, Hulu+ Live TV and DirecTV. Updated information for 4K streaming capabilities and requirements for multiple services. Reported on the upcoming shut down of Amazon‚Äôs Freevee service and the addition of DirecTV‚Äôs free service.\nAugust 6, 2024: Updated with the addition of Plex as a free live TV streaming recommendation and mentioned the additional free channels Philo is now including with the free version of its service. Added pricing information for ESPN's new sports-only streaming service, Venu.¬†\nJune 12, 2024: Updated with more information about 4K live streaming, picture-in-picture and multiview modes, as well as video on-demand options. We expanded our recommendations around free live TV streaming services and added a FAQ query about the safety of free streaming services and clarified the difference between standard and live streaming. More traditional streaming services have added live and sports components, so we revised that section accordingly.\nBack to topThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/best-live-tv-streaming-service-133000410.html?src=rss",
    "full_text": "For now these are the best live TV streaming services we tested, along with our breakdowns of how to stream and what you get. It‚Äôs similar to other free ad supported TV streamers, with a limited channel selection through the same Fubo interface. There‚Äôs still no way to stop whatever is playing as you browse the guide ‚Äî something I find irritating, but it might not bother everyone. The same goes for Samsung TV Plus, which added a trove of K-dramas to its free live and on-demand lineup in 2024. The FAST service has around 800 live TV channels that are organized fairly granularly and you can have up to 15 profiles. There was once a nifty integration with notable music streaming service Tidal, but that collaboration sadly came to an end late in 2024. People who don‚Äôt pay for Prime will still be able to access some of the free content through that app. Aside from being able to watch whenever it‚Äôs most convenient, you can also fast-forward through commercials in recorded content. Each plan gives you a certain number of simultaneous streams, aka how many screens can play content at the same time.

    "summary": "Whether you‚Äôre a true cord-cutter or you just want to watch the next season of Stranger Things when it drops, everyone‚Äôs on the lookout for streaming deals nowadays. Plenty have chosen VOD and live TV streaming services over traditional cable in recent years, but the savings that choice got you just a few years ago have somewhat evaporated now. Companies like Netflix, Disney, Max and others have been consistently raising prices to the point where you may question if streaming is even worth it anymore.\nWe at Engadget still think so, for many reasons, but you can (and should) be smart with your money at the same time. Streaming deals are an option, even if they don‚Äôt come around with the same regularity as discounts on AirPods do. If you‚Äôre looking to save money and still stream all of the content you want, Engadget can help by laying out the best streaming deals you can get right now, how you can save with bundles and everything you should know before paying for yet another streaming service. \nBest streaming deals\nTrue streaming deals can be hard to come by. Most often, they‚Äôll pop up during the Black Friday shopping period. On occasion, we‚Äôll see them sparingly throughout the year and they usually take the form of a discounted monthly or annual rate for a limited period of time. Also, true streaming deals are typically on the ad-supported versions of a service, but once in a while you‚Äôll find a unicorn of a deal on a tier that has ad-free viewing.\nIf you‚Äôre able to wait for a deal before subscribing to a streaming service, we recommend doing so. You‚Äôll save money upfront and in the long run, and you also have the option to cancel your subscription before the price goes back up to the normal rate. Maybe you find you like the service so much that you‚Äôre fine paying full price for it ‚Äî that‚Äôs the ideal situation. But if you‚Äôre not compelled to keep that app on rotation in your smart TV, most streaming services make it easy for you to cancel at any time. With that said, these are the best streaming deals you can snag right now.\n \nFubo Pro for $55/month for the first month ($30 off): Fubo has introductory discounts on most of its packages, and the Pro package is the least expensive plan currently listed. It offers access to 224 channels, unlimited cloud DVR and up to 10 simultaneous streams. It even includes regional sports content from the NHL, MLB and NBA.\nYouTube TV (three months) for $150 ($99 off): You can get three months of our favorite live TV streaming service for $50 per month. That should give you a decent chunk of time to see if the service is right for you while saving some cash. The discount and trial are only open to new subscribers to YouTube TV‚Äôs base plan, which includes access to over 100 channels, unlimited DVR space and six household accounts with the ability to stream on three devices at once.¬†\nSling Orange for $23/month for the first month (50 percent off): New customers can get Sling Orange or Sling Blue for half off the usual price for the first month, bringing the final prices to $23/month and $25.50/month, respectively. Orange is likely best for sports fans, with eight exclusive sports and family channels, while Blue includes 19 exclusive news and entertainment channels. You can get both Orange and Blue access also for half off for one month, or $33 total.\nSpotify Premium Individual (1 month) for $0 ($12 off): This is our favorite music streaming service for podcasts and social features. Right now, users who have not signed up for Spotify's Premium service before are eligible to get one month for free. The Premium Individual plan lets you listen ad-free and skip songs at will. You can also organize your listening queue and download content for offline listening. Just be aware, your subscription will auto-renew at the end of the trial period. So if you don't want to be on the hook for the $12 monthly fee, set a reminder to cancel and go back to the free version.\nPeacock first responders discount ‚Äî one year for $48 (50 percent off): Medical professionals and first responders can save 50 percent each year of Peacock. The deal requires annual verification and is open to those who work for either private or public institutions. Peacock has some great stuff to watch, including Poker Face and Killing It and more.\nStudent discounts on streaming services\nHBO Max student discount ‚Äî subscribe for $5/month (50 percent off): HBO Max offers their ad-supported tier to students for half off the usual rate. You‚Äôll just have to verify that you‚Äôre a student through Unidays, and make note that this offer is only good for up to 12 months of service.\nHulu student discount ‚Äî subscribe for $2/month (75 percent off): Those with a valid student ID can get Hulu‚Äôs ad-supported tier for 75 percent off the typical rate. They‚Äôll keep the same sale price for as long as they‚Äôre a student as well.\nSpotify student discount ‚Äî Premium + Hulu with ads for $6/month (72 percent off): Spotify‚Äôs student offer continues to be one of the best around, giving you access to the Premium tier of the music streamer and Hulu‚Äôs ad-supported plan for only $6 monthly. Purchased separately, you‚Äôd pay $22 per month for both of the services. Plus, the first month is free when you sign up.\nNBA League Pass student discount ‚Äî one year for $120 (40 percent off): Students can get one year of League Pass for only $10 per month, which includes access to NBA TV and the ability to watch classic and archive games on-demand. On the NBA League Pass website, look for the student discount banner at the top and follow the instructions to verify your student status.\nStreaming bundle discounts\nThere‚Äôs more consolidation happening now than ever before in the streaming space, and that means there are more streaming bundle options. These bundles offer you access to more content with one subscription price, but those prices are typically higher than paying for a single service by itself (obviously). It may be tempting to just get the bundle, but if only one of those services in the bundle speaks to you, you‚Äôll spend less overall by just paying for the single service.\nSpeaking of a deep love for a single streaming service: if all of your favorite shows are on Peacock or the latest releases on HBO Max consistently bring you joy, consider paying for one year upfront. Subscribing with an annual plan usually saves you money in the long term over paying on a monthly basis. Unfortunately, not all streaming services (looking at you, Netflix) have an annual subscription option. Here are some of the best streaming bundles you can get right now.\n \nDisney+, Hulu, HBO Max bundle with ads for $17/month: Ad-supported HBO Max is included here, along with full, ad-supported access to Disney+ and Hulu.
