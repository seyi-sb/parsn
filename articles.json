The company says the ChatGPT agent model scores 41.6% on Humanity’s Last Exam (pass@1), a difficult test made up of thousands of questions across more than one hundred subjects. OpenAI notes that it developed ChatGPT agent with safety in mind, largely because the product presents some newfound capabilities that could make it more dangerous in the hands of a bad actor."

    "full_text": "OpenAI is going all-in on the most-hyped trend in AI right now: AI agents, or tools that go a step beyond chatbots to complete complex, multi-step tasks on a user’s behalf. The company said the new tool can perform tasks like looking at a user’s calendar to brief them on upcoming client meetings, planning and purchasing ingredients to make a family breakfast, and creating a slide deck based on its analysis of competing companies. Another demonstration showed how ChatGPT Agent could generate a research report on the rise of Labubus versus Beanie Babies. Fulford said she enjoyed using it for online shopping because the combination of tech behind Deep Research and Operator worked better and was more thorough than trying the process solely using Operator. Kumar said that since ChatGPT Agent has access to “an entire computer” instead of just a browser, they’ve “enhanced the toolset quite a bit.” When asked about latency, Kumar said their team is more focused on “optimizing for hard tasks” and that users aren’t meant to sit and watch ChatGPT Agent work. OpenAI will start rolling out the tool today to Pro, Plus, and Team users — pick “agent mode” in the tools menu or type “/agent” to access it — and the company said it will make it available to ChatGPT Enterprise and Education users later this summer. There’s no rollout timeline yet for the European Economic Area and Switzerland. The term “AI agent” became more common to investors and tech executives in 2023 and quickly picked up speed, especially after fintech company Klarna announced in February 2024 that in just one month of operation, its own AI agent had handled two-thirds of its customer service chats — the equivalent of 700 full-time human workers. It’s also part of a larger trend in AI, as companies large and small chase AI agents that will capture the attention of consumers and ideally become habits."

Now those initial alpha tests have gone live with a few streamers, according to findings from market intelligence provider Appsensa. In a recent build, the firm found references to the vertical video tests and information about what sort of features these new streams would offer. Twitch’s tests are not widespread at this point, as Appsensa’s research only found a handful of references in the app’s code that mentioned the tests would focus on just “a few streamers” for the time being. (It was unable to identify which ones.) The firm was also able to identify a vertical theater mode with dedicated user interface elements and a way to toggle between Twitch’s classic and new vertical video formats. When users encounter the feature for the first time, they’ll be presented with user education dialogs that say “vertical video is here,” and remind users it’s still just a test and they can switch to the classic view at any time. Reached for comment, Twitch declined to say more about the tests, only noting that the company had said during its keynote at TwitchCon Rotterdam earlier this year that it would begin testing with a small number of channels during the summer. A spokesperson added that those tests would expand to more users later in the year. During TwitchCon, the company announced it would try out dual-format and 2K streaming with a small number of channels, as well."

    "full_text": "is The Verge’s senior AI reporter. An AI beat reporter for more than five years, her work has also appeared in CNBC, MIT Technology Review, Wired UK, and other outlets. A California federal judge ruled Thursday that three authors suing Anthropic over copyright infringement can bring a class action lawsuit representing all U.S. writers whose work was allegedly downloaded from libraries of pirated works. The filing alleges that Anthropic, the Amazon-backed OpenAI competitor behind the chatbot Claude, “violated the Copyright Act by doing Napster-style downloading of millions of works.” It alleges that the company downloaded as many as seven million copies of books from libraries of pirated works. The new ruling impacts a lawsuit filed last August by authors Andrea Bartz, Charles Graeber, and Kirk Wallace Johnson, who alleged that Anthropic had “built a multibillion-dollar business by stealing hundreds of thousands of copyrighted books.” Late last month, a federal judge sided with Anthropic to rule that training its AI models on legally-purchased books was fair use but noted the company would need to face a separate trial for using allegedly pirated books. It also follows the lawsuit Reddit filed against Anthropic last month, claiming that the AI company’s bots had accessed Reddit more than 100,000 times since last July, after Anthropic had said it blocked them from doing so. The authors’ lawsuit is part of a growing trend of media outlets, platforms, companies, and creatives either suing AI companies over copyright infringement — for instance, Universal Music’s 2023 lawsuit against Anthropic over “systematic and widespread infringement of their copyrighted song lyrics” — or partnering up with them to willingly provide AI training data in order to get a slice of the profits."

That age verification, for those 13 to 17, will unlock a feature called \"Trusted Connections\" that allows for less filtered text or voice chat. Teens 13 to 17 will only be able to add people 18 and older as friends if they're eligible to access Trusted Connections, and only if they know them in real life -- as verified with a QR code or a contact importer tool -- Roblox says. Other changes include more tools to manage notifications, screen time and privacy, as well as additional tools for parents to monitor their teen's Roblox usage such as money spent or the amount of time they're spending on the platform. The changes are part of a longer-term effort by Roblox to make its platform safer for younger players. Last year, Roblox added more parental controls and monitoring as well as content labels within its virtual worlds. The platform has been plagued with predators targeting children and instances of illegal gambling. For those who are 18 or older, the changes should be minimal, although it's possible some users will be asked to verify their age even if they're older then the 13 to 17 age range. For parents, there should be more options to monitor their kids' use of the platform. While some of the changes appear to be happening immediately, such as the introduction of Connections, other features may take longer to implement, including the option for parental consent for those 13 to 17."

    "summary": "Amazon’s decarbonization goals are being undermined by its push to be a leader in generative AI. Its most recent sustainability report concedes its overall carbon emissions grew for the first time since 2022. It reported a six percent increase in its carbon footprint across 2024, laying much of the blame at the feet of its data center rollout.\nThe reported increase is significant given Amazon’s method of reporting its own environmental impact. Critics have suggested the mega-retailer “dramatically undercounts” its impact by excluding common metrics. In 2022, Amazon revised its climate reporting methodology which also led to the company’s figures falling dramatically.\nIn addition, the company reported an increase in emissions tied to the purchase of power from outside sources. “The increased energy demand is from AI chips,” says the report, which “require more electricity and cooling than traditional chips.” As well as the power to run and cool those chips, Amazon is building big to increase its server capacity. Data center construction, as well as fuel use by logistics contractors, led indirect emissions to increase by six percent. That said, the company’s own fossil fuel emissions increased by seven percent in 2024, which is hardly a ringing endorsement.\nAmazon is a co-founder of The Climate Pledge, an initiative to reach net zero emissions by 2040. The initiative now has 549 signatories, including MasterCard, Sony and Snap.inc.\nIn February, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy pledged to invest $100 billion across 2025, with CNBC reporting the bulk of that cash would be spent on Amazon Web Services (the company’s data center and web hosting arm). Given the increase in construction, it’s likely Amazon’s report for 2025 will follow this same upward trend.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/general/amazons-ai-push-is-undermining-its-sustainability-goals-160156136.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "You might already have a good idea of which smartphone you want to be your next one. But there are more solid options available now than ever before, making the decision not as cut-and-dry as it used to be. While the decision is a bit easier if you know you want an iPhone, there's even enough variation between those new models that you may have to think about it longer than you anticipated. If you’re an Android person, you have even more options to choose from — including foldables — and more questions to answer before you spend any money.At Engadget, we review phones regularly and have tested dozens over the years. Whether you’ve had your eye on one of our current top picks, one of Samsung's Galaxy S25 phones, a cheap phone or another device, we’re here to help you decide which is the best phone to buy this year.\nAndroid or iOS?\nWhen you're searching for the best smartphone, it becomes clear that each OS has its pros and cons. Apple’s tight-knit ecosystem makes it super easy to share data between iPhones, iPads and Macs or seamlessly hand-off phone calls or music from one device to another. At the same time, you’re effectively locked in, as services like Apple Messages aren’t available on other platforms. \nAs for Android, there’s a much wider range of handsets from companies like Google, Samsung, Sony and more. However, Android phones don’t enjoy that same length of software support and often have lower trade-in values. In short, there’s no wrong answer. However, you will want to consider how your phone will fit in with the rest of your devices. So unless you’re really fed up with one OS and willing to learn another, it probably doesn’t make a lot of sense to switch from an iPhone to an Android phone (or vice versa) – especially if everyone else in your household is using the same platform.\nCameras\nSince your cell phone often pulls double duty as your primary camera, figuring out what kind of photo tools you want is key. Nowadays, practically every mobile phone can take a great picture in bright light. But if you want a long optical zoom, you’ll probably have to upgrade to a more expensive device.\n\n\n\n\n  Cherlynn Low / Engadget\n \n\nMid-range phones often only have two rear cameras (a primary wide-angle lens and a secondary ultra-wide camera) and can sometimes struggle in low-light situations. Each phone maker also has various features that might be a better fit for your style, with Apple offering four different color presets on the latest iPhones, while Google’s Pixel 9 Pro comes with neat tools like dedicated long exposure and Action Pan modes.\nWill you get mmWave 5G or Wi-Fi 7?\nThe good news is that in 2025, most phones have at least Wi-Fi 6 or Wi-Fi 6e and support for some kind of 5G connectivity. However, if you want the fastest wireless speeds possible, it’s going to cost you a little extra. For example, on certain networks, mmWave 5G offers up to gigabit download speeds, less latency and better bandwidth. But mmWave 5G also requires more sophisticated (and pricier) modems, which means support for it is often missing on less expensive devices.\nOn the bright side, mmWave 5G isn’t as widely available as other versions of 5G, so depending on where you live and what network you’re on, you may not be missing out on much right now if you buy a phone that doesn’t support it. It’s a similar situation for Wi-Fi 7, which is available on some high-end handsets like the Galaxy S25, but harder to find on cheaper devices. Wi-Fi 7 also requires you to have a compatible router, so unless you know you need it or have a specific use case in mind, the lack of support for mmWave 5G or Wi-Fi 7 shouldn’t be a dealbreaker when looking for a new phone.\nOther features to consider\nBecause not everyone agrees on what makes the best phone, you should think about any other specs that might be extra important for you. Mobile gamers will almost certainly appreciate the 120Hz refresh rates you get on phones like the Samsung Galaxy S25 or the Apple iPhone 16 Pro. Alternatively, if long battery life is important, you’ll probably want to go with a larger iPhone or an Android phone with a battery that’s between 4,000 and 5,000 mAh in size. Meanwhile, if you find yourself juggling a lot of devices, it can be really nice to have a phone that supports reverse wireless charging, which on Samsung phones even lets you recharge the company’s Galaxy Watches.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther smartphones we've tested\nSamsung Galaxy S25 Ultra\nLike its predecessor, the S25 Ultra is an incredibly versatile phone. It’s one of the few handsets that come with an included stylus and premium features like a gorgeous 6.9-inch AMOLED display, titanium frame and a 5x telephoto camera. It also has excellent performance and strong battery life. The issue is that, aside from improved AI, this year’s phone doesn’t offer that much more than the previous model (or the one before that), and with prices starting at $1,300, we feel it needs to do more to earn a top pick spot.\nOnePlus 13\nWhile the OnePlus 13 features some basic AI features like Google’s Circle to Search and Gemini assistant, it’s really just an old-fashioned flagship in all the best ways. That’s because instead of focusing on machine learning, OnePlus crammed the phone with tons of top-notch hardware. It sports a 6.8-inch OLED display with an incredible peak brightness of up to 4,500 nits. The OP13 also offers excellent performance thanks to Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 8 Elite chip, along with 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage. There are also three 50-MP rear cameras including one with a 3x telephoto zoom and a massive 6,000 mAh battery that’s bigger than what you get in practically all of its competitors.\nOnePlus didn’t skimp on the phone’s design either, as the OP13 still comes with the company’s signature Alert Slider. Plus, if you opt for the blue or white variants, you’ll get a durable and very touchable vegan leather back that helps the phone stand out among all its glass brick rivals. But the best part is that starting at $900, it costs less than an equivalent Galaxy S25+ too.\nFAQs\nHow do I know which smartphone is the best for me?\nWhile choosing the best smartphone can be challenging, it mostly comes down to how you plan on using the device. All of the best phones available now get the basics right — you’ll be able to make calls, text and access the internet without many hiccups. If your smartphone is your most used gadget, you may want to consider paying for a device on the higher end of the price spectrum. That will get you better overall performance, higher-quality cameras and a phone that will last for many years. If you don’t use your phone for everything, you may be able to compromise on performance and extra perks and spend less on a still-capable handset.\nHow much is a smartphone?\nSmartphones range in price from $300 to over $1,500. The best budget phones available now will usually compromise on overall performance, design, camera prowess and extra features to keep costs down. On the flip side, the most expensive phones will have powerful processors, triple-camera arrays and even flip or fold designs. Most people will find a phone that fits their needs somewhere in the middle of that wide price range — we’ve found that most of the best smartphones available right now cost between $500 and $1,000.\nWhat can you do on a smartphone?\nSmartphones are essentially small, portable computers that let you do things like check email, browse social media, follow map directions, make contactless payments and more. This is all on top of the basics like making phone calls and texting, which we’ve come to expect in all modern cell phones. Smartphones have also mostly replaced compact cameras thanks to their high-quality, built-in shooters, and the fact that most smartphones today as just as portable, if not more so, as compact cameras.\nHow long do smartphones last?\nSmartphones can last years and people are holding on to their phones longer now than ever before. Software updates and battery life are two of the biggest factors that can affect phone longevity. Apple promises five years worth of software updates for its latest iPhones, and Google promises the same for its Pixel phones. Samsung phones will get four years worth of Android updates from the time they launch. As for charging speeds and battery life, your phone can deteriorate over time as you use and recharge your phone on a regular basis.\nRecent updates\nJuly 2025: Updated to include the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7.\nApril 2025: Updated to include the Google Pixel 9a.\nFebruary 2025: Updated to include the iPhone 16e.\nJanuary 2025: Updated to include details about Samsung's latest Galaxy S-series phones.\nSeptember 2024: Updated to include the latest iPhone 16 models and a new midrange iPhone top pick.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/best-smartphones-140004900.html?src=rss",

But mmWave 5G also requires more sophisticated (and pricier) modems, which means support for it is often missing on less expensive devices. As we discovered in our testing for the iPhone 16 Pro review, it’ll take a bit of getting used to at first. The Pixel 9 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro both start at $999, and though some of us have come to think of Google's handsets as the more competitively priced option, this year's model might be good enough to justify a premium price. So while it's not super fancy, the phone has all of its most important bases covered (and then some). Samsung says this is its brightest foldable display yet, making it easier to use and read outdoors. But the best part is that starting at $900, it costs less than an equivalent Galaxy S25+ too. Smartphones can last years and people are holding on to their phones longer now than ever before."

Its latest, the Dyson TP07, is a behemoth with king-size activated carbon and glass HEPA air filters hugging the base intake. That allows it to purify the air it puts out, removing things like dust and allergens from the air you breathe. You don't have to spend that much on every air purifier but if you want a combo option this is the elite choice. The Dyson also boasts 10-speed settings ranging from an ultraquiet 28 decibels up to a 48-decibel blast of concentrated air. It was the most comfortable tower fan I tested, too, with a cool, steady stream of air that feels like a much less forceful version of one of Dyson's bathroom hand dryers. I'll admit I didn't spend too much time testing all of the features but the app offers a detailed look at the air quality in your home and it lets you create custom cooling schedules too. The TP07 also supports voice control via Alexa or Siri. That's too much for many people unless you're looking into a serious upgrade. Anyone who wants to keep the fan cost within reasonable levels."

    "full_text": "I also tried slim cases that have one job: to protect the console when it isn’t in use. I just listed my high standards for form-fitting cases made to fit the Switch 2 while it’s in use. The tier I recommend for most Switch 2 players (especially those who will often throw their console into a bag) is the $79.85 “Travel” tier, which includes a semi-transparent travel cover that protects the front of your console during transit, or just for safekeeping when you aren’t using it. When this post originally went live, Dbrand was in the midst of updating its Killswitch so that it wouldn’t allow the Joy-Con 2s’ magnets to break away without pressing their release buttons. Belkin’s case can carry 12 cartridges, and it’s only slightly thicker than the PowerA case, likely to compensate for whatever cables or small gizmos you might stuff into its pocket. Neither of those may be deal-breakers for you, but are worth keeping in mind. JSAUX makes a relatively slim zip-up Switch 2 case that absolutely pops with color. Expressiveness is its main appeal, as this $25.99 case slouches on other features you might want. Underneath it is a fabric tray stitched into the case that can hold 12 game cartridges. If you don’t ever plan to connect your Switch 2 to its dock or detach its Joy-Cons, or it’ll be a rare occurrence, you might pick an all-in-one shell that fits completely around the console."

For a long time, it seemed like the project might be dead in the water given how little news there was about it. But now it looks like the streamer is ready to lock in and get down to business. Netflix announced today that it has officially greenlit a new Assassin’s Creed series that will be showrun and executive produced by Roberto Patino (Westworld, Sons of Anarchy) and David Wiener (Halo, Brave New World.) Along with Wiener and Patino, Ubisoft’s Gerard Guillemot, Margaret Boykin, and Austin Dill, and Matt O’Toole are attached to executive produce. Per Netflix, the new series will focus on “the secret war between two shadowy factions — one set on determining mankind’s future through control and manipulation, while the other fights to preserve free will.” The show will tell stories about multiple characters living through and influencing pivotal moments in human history. That doesn’t exactly say much about what the series will look and feel like, but it does sound like pretty standard Assassin’s Creed fare. In a statement about the show, Wiener and Patino said that they’re both excited about and humbled by all the possibilities the Assassin’s Creed IP holds. They also expressed their desire to use the series to tell a story about what humanity loses as a species as our emotional connections break. But more than anything, this is a show about the value of human connection, across cultures, across time.”"

Even a September move may require more definitive evidence that the economy is cooling,\" Kushi said. Fewer interest rate cuts combined with the recently passed budget bill, which is expected to significantly boost government debt deficits, are likely to keep upward pressure on longer-term bond yields and mortgage rates. Here are some proven strategies that can help you save up to 1.5% on your mortgage rate. Your credit score will help determine whether you qualify for a mortgage and at what interest rate. If you can afford it, a down payment of at least 20% will also eliminate private mortgage insurance. Comparing loan offers from multiple mortgage lenders can help you negotiate a better rate. Experts recommend getting at least two to three loan estimates from different lenders."

    "summary": "\"This is probably the most uncertain future NASA has faced, maybe since the end of Apollo,\" Casey Dreier tells me over the phone. Dreier is the chief of space policy at The Planetary Society, a nonprofit that advocates for the exploration and study of space.\nOn July 10, the Senate Appropriations Committee met to discuss the proposed federal Commerce, Justice and Science budget for 2026. While on average, funding for NASA has accounted for about 0.3 percent of total yearly spending by the federal government since the start of the 2010s, President Trump has called for a 24 percent cut year over year to the agency's operating allowance. By any metric, his plan would be devastating.\nAdjusted for inflation, it would leave NASA with the smallest operating budget it has had since Russian cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin became the first human to travel to space in 1961. In the process, it would eviscerate the agency's science budget by nearly half, resulting in the termination of 55 ongoing and or planned missions. It would also leave NASA with its smallest workforce in 70 years. All this, at a time when the agency has been tasked with returning to the Moon and bringing the first humans to Mars.\n\"There's no historical precedent to this level of single year, functionally indiscriminate and dramatic cuts. You lose, in one year, a third of all active science projects. [The Trump administration is] proposing to turn off missions that are performing not just good science, but unique and irreplaceable science. This isn't so they can reinvest the money in some radical new science efforts. No, the money is gone,\" said Dreier. \"It's almost certainly the greatest threat to NASA science activities in the history of the space agency.\"\nDreier isn't exaggerating when he says some missions would be impossible to replace. One of the casualties of Trump's cuts would be the New Horizons probe. In 2015, New Horizons gave us our best look at Pluto ever. Four years later, it performed the farthest flyby in human history. As things stand, it's the only active spacecraft in the Kuiper belt, a region of our solar system that is not well-understood by scientists. Even if NASA were to start working on a replacement today, it would take a generation for that vehicle to reach where New Horizons is right now. It costs NASA about $14.7 million per year to continue operating the probe, a fraction of the $29.9 billion in additional funding Congress allocated to fund ICE enforcement and detainment operations in the president's recently passed tax bill.\nHeather Roper\nAnother mission that would be impossible to replace is OSIRIS-APEX. If the name sounds familiar, it's because OSRIS-APEX is a continuation of NASA's incredibly successful OSRIS-REx flight. In 2020, the spacecraft visited 101955 Bennu, an ancient asteroid about the size of the Empire State Building, and collected a sample of regolith (rocks and dirt) from its surface using a never-before-tried technique.\nAfter OSRIS-REx successfully returned the sample to Earth, NASA decided to extend the spacecraft's mission and fly to another asteroid, 99942 Apophis. In 2029, Apophis will pass about 19,600 miles from Earth. It will be the closest approach of any known asteroid of its size. NASA said the extension would add $200 million to a mission that had already cost it an estimated $1.16 billion.\n\"This project is a pennies on the dollar repurposing of an existing spacecraft. It's the only American spacecraft that will be at Apophis for a once in a generation opportunity to study an asteroid that will just barely miss us,\" said Dreier. \"That seems important to know.\"\nAt a time when nearly every facet of American life is being upturned, the potential cancellation of dozens of NASA missions might seem a distant concern, but the gutting of the agency's science budget would have a ripple effect on communities across the US.\n\"NASA is an engine for jobs in the country, and for every NASA job, there are many more that are created in the private workforce,\" said Bethany Ehlmann, Professor of Planetary Science at the California Institute of Technology. She also serves on the board of directors for The Planetary Society.\nProfessor Ehlmann's claim is supported by NASA's own data. In 2023, the agency employed 17,823 full-time civil servants nationwide. With NASA's private sector support factored in, that year the agency's missions were responsible for sustaining 304,803 jobs across all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Put another way, for every full-time equivalent job at a NASA facility, NASA supports at least 16 private sector jobs. \"Space science has been broadly supported and impacts roughly three quarters of every congressional district in the country,\" said Dreier. \"It's not just a red or blue state thing.\"\nFollowing last week's Senate meeting, policymakers from both parties said they would push back on President Trump's NASA budget cuts. On Tuesday, the House Appropriations Committee's Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science and Related Agencies passed a funding bill that would provide NASA with a total budget of $24.8 billion for 2026, or the same amount it was allocated this year. The week before, the corresponding subcommittee in the Senate passed its own NASA funding bill.\nThe two versions differ on one critical detail. The Senate legislation maintains the agency's science budget at $7.3 billion, while the House version seeks to reduce it by 18 percent to $6 billion. Separately, the House is calling for a 23 percent cut to the National Science Foundation's budget. NSF funds much of the nation's astronomy research.\n\"What I'm hearing from lawmakers is that they understand how important NASA is to industry. They understand how important NASA is to universities in terms of training, and providing grants that train the next generation of the space workforce,\" said Professor Ehlmann, who was on Capitol Hill last week. The House and Senate will need to come to an agreement for the bill to move forward.\nEven with many lawmakers in favor of maintaining NASA's budget, a flat budget is still a funding cut when accounting for inflation. Moreover, NASA has already been negatively affected by the Trump administration's efforts to trim the federal workforce.\nAccording to reporting Politico published on July 9, 2,694 NASA employees have agreed to leave the agency through either early retirement, a buyout or a deferred resignation. Of those individuals, 2,145 are workers in senior positions and 1,818 are staff serving in missions areas like human spaceflight and science. \"Once the workforce is gone, they're gone. You lose a ton of institutional knowledge,\" said Dreier. The employees who have agreed to leave represent about 15 percent of NASA's 2023 workforce of 17,823. With the July 25 deadline for early retirement, voluntary separation and deferred resignations quickly approaching, that number is likely to grow. NASA's shifting priorities under the Trump administration have also created uncertainty among the agency's contractors.\nAccording to former NASA employee and NASA Watch creator Keith Cowing the workforce cuts are already affecting employees. \"In the 40 years I've been involved with NASA in one way or another, I've never seen morale so bad,\" he said. \"Is NASA bloated? Yeah, but the way you deal with bloat is to go in with a scalpel and you cut carefully. And yet you have people [like Elon Musk] standing on stage with chainsaws. That is not the way to run government, and it's certainly not the way to create the machinery needed to explore the universe.\"\nWhatever happens next, Dreier worries there's the potential for there to be an erosion in public support for NASA. He points to a survey published by Pew Research. In 2023, the organization found that monitoring for asteroids that could hit Earth and tracking changes to the planet's climate were the two activities Americans wanted NASA to prioritize over other mandates. By contrast, sending human astronauts to the Moon and Mars were the least important priorities for the public.\nREUTERS / Reuters\nThe House version of NASA's 2026 budget would boost the agency's exploration budget by 25 percent to $9.7 billion. In Trump's tax bill, Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) included language that provided NASA with $4.1 billion for the fourth and fifth flights of the Space Launch System (SLS) rocket — the vehicle intended to carry the first NASA astronauts back to the Moon before before private sector alternatives like SpaceX's Starship are ready to fly.\nWith both the Trump administration and House pushing Moon and Mars missions as priorities, Dreier says they're \"ironically doubling down on the activities that the private sector is already doing — SpaceX says it's going to send humans to Mars — and abandoning the things that only NASA does. There's no private sector company doing space science.\"\nIn effect, a NASA budget that sacrifices on scientific research in lieu of Mars missions would be one that invests in things the public says are the least important to it.\n\"I worry that they're moving away from what the public expects their space agency to do, and that as a consequence, it will undermine public investment in NASA,\" he said. \"NASA is usually tied for the number one or two most popular federal agency. People wear NASA t-shirts. No one wears a Department of the Interior t-shirt walking out of the GAP. It's a rare and precious thing to have, and they're risking it. It's not just the future of the agency that's at risk, but the future of the public's relationship with it.\"\nWhen asked for comment on this story, Bethany Stevens, NASA's press secretary, pointed Engadget to a letter from Acting Administrator Janet Petro NASA shared in a technical supplement it published alongside the president's budget request.\n\"We must continue to be responsible stewards of taxpayer dollars. That means making strategic decisions — including scaling back or discontinuing ineffective efforts not aligned with our Moon and Mars exploration priorities\" Petro wrote.\nThe final NASA budget for 2026 is still months away from being finalized. After Tuesday's vote, the two funding bills will move to the full Senate and House appropriations committees for a vote and further revisions. Only after that will every member of each chamber get a chance to vote on the matter. Congress has until September 30 to complete the appropriations process before 2025 funding runs out. President Trump could also decide to veto the bill if it doesn't align with his priorities.\nHave a tip for Igor?

Danna, who serves as Boulevard’s CEO, said he was first surprised that medspa owners were interested in using the company’s software instead of electronic medical records systems (EMRs). He discovered that EMRs are better suited for clients billing insurance, whereas MedSpas predominantly run on a cash-pay model. Three years after introducing these features, Boulevard estimates that it is powering approximately 15% of all MedSpas in the U.S. “I am really impressed by how beauty and medical services lines are blurring,” Danna said."

The devices and accessories have previously typically only been available in white or black, but are now available in forest green, pink petal, wild lavender, and glacier ice (a very light blue). The collection includes the $149.99 Stream Deck, the $169.99 Wave XLR microphone interface, the $99.99 Wave DX mic, the $149.99 Wave:3 mic, and the $99.99 Wave Mic Arm LP. If you already have the Stream Deck or the Wave XLR and are feeling envious about the new color options, Elgato also sells a $14.99 faceplate for the Stream Deck in all four new shades, and a $19.99 one for the Wave XLR so you can update your existing gear. Elgato is also selling its new Dreamscape collection in discounted bundles. The discounts range from two percent off if you buy two of them to 20 percent off if you bundle all five (not including the faceplates). You also don’t have to stick to just one color option when building a bundle. You can mix and match the new shades if you want to give your streaming setup a punch of color but aren’t worried about maintaining a uniform theme. To complete the look, the company offers Dreamscape icons and button labels for the Stream Deck, available for download through the Elgato Marketplace, that complement the four new color options."

    "full_text": "Valve’s Steam Deck has dominated the handheld gaming PC space since its 2022 debut. But with SteamOS, the same 60fps gameplay requires just 22 watts, giving you an entire extra hour of gameplay (55 watt-hours divided by 22 watts = 2.5 hours) just by installing a different OS. This honestly feels like an oversight, and I hope it’ll be fixed. The Steam Deck’s one notable disadvantage is that its performance has only slightly improved in three and a half years as games continue to get more demanding. The Legion Go S officially brings those “turbo” modes to SteamOS, as well. At max boost on wall power, the base Legion Go S can offer up to 35 percent better framerates. That’s enough to make a game feel smooth that was barely playable — like Expedition 33 at the lowest settings — or comfortably go up an entire graphics preset in most games when you’re plugged into the wall. Despite having a smaller 49Wh battery, it lasted over 50 minutes longer than either Legion Go S in my Dirt Rally battery drain test (where I set each handheld’s screen to the same brightness using a calibration tool) and managed two extra hours of magic poker game Balatro with battery-saving tweaks: 9 hours for Steam Deck vs. 7 hours for the Legion Go S. (You can technically install SteamOS on the Windows-based Legion Go S, but Valve tells me that’s not officially supported, and I ran into several issues when I tried it in early June.) (We’re still waiting on a way to control those RGB joystick LEDs in SteamOS, though.)"

Waymo’s vehicles are unsupervised and available at any time, while Tesla’s vehicles include a safety monitor in the passenger seat, only operate between 6AM and midnight, and are invite-only. Waymo also stressed “no waitlists or caveats” as part of its service, which is available exclusively on the Uber app. Companies tend to target denser areas with more customers and more desirable locations, while also keeping in mind that expanding too rapidly could compromise safety. Tesla’s robotaxis have already racked up a list of mistakes, and the presence of the safety monitor is a clear sign that the company isn’t confident enough in its technology to deploy its vehicles without supervision. Still, there have been no serious safety incidents involving either company in Austin yet. Embarrassing incidents are a certainty as more robotaxis hit the road and their service areas expand. But when it comes to scale, Waymo is the clear winner right now."

    "full_text": "Unlike other display drawing tablets in Wacom’s lineup, the $449 MovinkPad doesn’t need to be connected to a laptop or PC, placing it in direct competition with the Apple Pencil and iPad combo that’s proved incredibly popular with digital artists. Unlike Apple’s iPad lineup, however, the 11.45-inch MovinkPad prioritizes digital drawing capabilities over typical activities you would use a tablet for. At 10.5 x 7.2 x 0.3 inches, it’s slightly larger than the 11-inch iPad Air and weighs 1.3 pounds (588 grams) compared to Apple’s one-pound (460 grams) offering. That limitation isn’t ideal for a tablet that users will want to save a lot of image files without relying on cloud storage. The MovinkPad supports the same 8,192 pressure levels and 60-degree pen tilt angles as Wacom’s main drawing display tablet lineup. It comes with the customizable Wacom Pro Pen 3, which includes a nib holder and customizable side switches, and supports a range of third-party digital pens from brands such as Dr. iPads still have an edge here because Procreate — often ranked as the top creative app on Apple’s App Store — is an iOS exclusive for now, though Procreate developer James Cuda has mused on plans to bring it to other platforms eventually. The MovinkPad 11 is a far cry from Wacom’s previous attempts to launch an all-in-one drawing tablet: the MobileStudio Pro series came with built-in PC hardware, which made it too heavy to lug around easily and cost up to $3,500, which also made it too expensive for hobbyist illustrators to consider. At $449, the MovinkPad undercuts Wacom’s MobileStudio Pro line, but the cheapest A16 chip iPad ($349) is still a more affordable choice, even with the additional requirement to purchase a first-gen Apple Pencil ($99). Still, the Wacom Pro Pen 3 support and other illustration-focused goodies may give Wacom the opportunity to poach customers who were looking at Apple’s more expensive iPad models."

    "full_text": "Hackers have stolen more than $2 billion in crypto during the first half of 2025, according to new data from crypto analysis firm Chainalysis, marking the worst year-to-date on record for crypto thefts. The blockchain analysis company said Thursday in a new report that the $2.17 billion stolen during the first half of 2025 has already surpassed the amount of crypto lost last year. Not only that, the amount of cryptocurrency stolen during the first six months of 2025 was about 17% higher than the same period in 2022, which was previously the worst year on record for stolen crypto. Much of the stolen crypto this year was attributed to a single breach at crypto exchange Bybit, which saw North Korean hackers steal more than $1.4 billion in crypto, much of it subsequently laundered and funneled into the North Korean regime, per the FBI. Chainalysis said the Bybit hack falls within a broader pattern of North Korean hacks, which have “become increasingly central to the regime’s sanctions evasion strategies.” North Korea, largely cut off from the outside world and the international banking system, has become a formidable threat in recent years by targeting Western companies to steal cryptocurrency with the aim of funding its sanctioned nuclear weapons program. North Korea has also relied on thousands of remote IT workers, who infiltrate tech companies to earn a wage, steal intellectual property, and then extort companies into paying so as not to publish their sensitive files. According to an earlier Chainalysis report, North Korean hackers were blamed for almost two-thirds of all crypto hacks during 2024."

The other new plan, Audiobooks+ for Plan Members, will be an even more welcome addition for those who want to share access to audiobooks: Members on Premium Family and Duo plans will be able to access 15 hours of monthly audiobook listening, too. Similar plans will arrive later in the U.S., Spotify told TechCrunch. To use the feature, plan members will first request audiobook access from their plan manager, who purchases the new add-on. A spokesperson said that users in those markets can visit the Spotify.com/audiobooks page to learn more. One major publisher, HarperCollins, noted in December that Spotify was working to bring audiobooks to other family members on shared plans. At a conference, HarperCollins CEO Brian Murray said that the market had potential for further growth as Spotify was at the time working out a “technical issue” with family plans that limited audiobooks to the plan’s credit card holder. The streaming service sees AI as another opportunity for expansion, saying in last quarter’s earnings that it was working with ElevenLabs to get more books narrated, including translating texts from English to other languages."

    "summary": "Jack Dorsey has been back in the news lately after unveiling a pair of new apps he worked on, Bluetooth-based messenager Bitchat and UV exposure tracker Sun Day. The Block CEO put those together under the auspices of a new development collective called \"and Other Stuff,\" a nonprofit that he is backing with a $10 million cash injection through his StartSmall foundation, as TechCrunch reports.\nThe group plans to work on open-source projects, including ones that could become consumer social media apps, along with app-development tools. The developers met on Nostr, a social networking protocol Dorsey has also backed financially. \nThe \"and Other Stuff\" collective aims to support Nostr's \"transition from an experimental protocol to a widely adopted, sustainable ecosystem through collaborative growth and funding.\" In addition to Nostr projects, the collaborators plan to experiment with building tools based on the likes of ActivityPub — which powers Mastodon — and Cashu. That e-cash platform's creator, dubbed Calle, is part of the \"and other Stuff\" team alongside Twitter’s first employee, Evan Henshaw-Plath.\nThe projects that \"and Other Stuff\" has worked on so far include voice note app heynow, a private messenger app called White Noise and social community +chorus. They have also created Shakespeare, which is designed to help developers build Nostr-based social apps with AI.\nDorsey has long fostered an interest in open-source protocols. In 2019, during his second stint as Twitter CEO, the company set up a team that was tasked with forming an open, decentralized standard for social media. Dorsey had hoped to eventually shift Twitter onto that protocol, but of course that didn't pan out. Instead, Twitter spun out that project — Bluesky — as a public benefit corporation in 2022. Last year, after leaving Bluesky's board, Dorsey claimed that the team there was \"literally repeating all the mistakes\" he made while running Twitter such as, uh, setting up moderation tools (which are, in reality, a critically important aspect of any successful social platform).\nOn an episode of Henshaw-Plath's new podcast, Dorsey reiterated a point he had made previously, that Twitter was beholden to advertisers (an issue that X is contending with under Elon Musk's ownership). \"It’s hard for something like [Twitter] to be a company, because you have corporate incentives when it wants to be a protocol,\" Dorsey said. \"If [Twitter] were an open protocol, if it were truly an open project, you could build a business on top of it, and you could build a very healthy business on top of it.\"\nHe was also once again critical of Bluesky's structure, adding that, \"I want to push the energy in a different direction... which is more like Bitcoin, which is completely open and not owned by anyone from a protocol layer. That’s what I see in Nostr as well. That’s where I want to push my energy... rather into the more corporate direction, even if it is a public benefit corporation.\"This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/jack-dorsey-backs-an-open-source-development-collective-with-10-million-140052825.html?src=rss",

    "full_text": "Starlink has brought high-speed internet to millions of rural Americans for the first time. So, how is it available in New York for just $15 a month? If Starlink wants to sell internet in the state, it doesn’t have a choice. That’s thanks to the Affordable Broadband Act, a New York state law passed in January. The Affordable Broadband Act says that major ISPs (those serving 20,000 households or more) operating in New York must offer plans starting at $15 per month with download speeds of at least 25Mbps to qualifying households, or a $20-per-month plan with minimum download speeds of 200Mbps. Some providers, like AT&T, chose to pull out of the state entirely rather than offer the discounted prices that New York’s law requires. Households are eligible for these plans if they have an annual income up to 185% of the federal poverty level -- $59,477.50 for a family of four -- or if they participate in programs like the National School Lunch Program, Medicaid or SNAP. (Disclosure: PCMag is owned by the same parent company as CNET, Ziff Davis.) But access to fast and reliable internet is still a challenge for many people in rural New York. The most recent FCC data shows that about 3% of homes in New York don’t have access to the FCC’s definition of minimum broadband speeds: 100Mbps download and 20Mbps upload."

Gauthier Andres, a reporter and co-founder at Origami, was first to report the news, which the studio later confirmed. Virtuos has provided support on a number of large game projects — including a recent patch for Cyberpunk 2077 — and employs more than 4,200 people across the US, Europe and Asia.\nThe company said the layoffs are primarily affecting \"teams facing lower occupancy and slower demand due to structural shifts in the industry.\" It's firing around 200 people in Asia and approximately 70 in Europe. \"Fewer than 10\" of those are in France, where the core team working on Oblivion Remastered is based. Virtuos says it's offering affected workers layoff packages, career transition assistance and, \"where possible,\" job opportunities across its network. \n\"Over the past 12 months, Virtuos has deepened its commitment to premium co-development through key acquisitions of Beyond-FX, Pipeworks, and Umanaïa in North America, as well as Third Kind Games and Abstraction in Europe,\" Virtuos said in a statement. \"These studios enhance our strengths in VFX, design, Unreal Engine programming and creative development. This ongoing investment reflects our intent to grow in areas where our expertise and scale create lasting value, while selectively exiting service segments where demand is weakening. We need to better match the locations of our teams with those of our clients to support the increasingly iterative nature of creative co-development.

Nothing about the company's output or the critical reception of its games would suggest it needs to conduct layoffs, but that reflects the current precarious state of the games industry. Even having theoretically steady work doing post-release support and game remasters isn't enough.\nVirtuos' layoffs follows the sweeping cuts Microsoft made to its Xbox division in early July. Microsoft reportedly cancelled games, like Rare's long-in-development Everwild, and shutdown whole studios, like The Initiative.

    "summary": "Stellantis, the automotive giant behind Chrysler, Citroen, Fiat, Jeep and Peugeot, is pulling out of hydrogen. The company said it’s killing its fuel cell development program in the face of  “limited availability of hydrogen refueling infrastructure, high capital requirements and the need for stronger consumer purchasing incentives.” To put that another way, it’s realized hydrogen EVs are facing the same set of challenges it’s not been able to overcome in the last two or three decades.\nIt’s a stark shift in tone from January 2024, when the company promised to roll out a fleet of commercial fuel cell vehicles. Stellantis sells many of Europe’s most popular panel vans including the Citroen Jumper, Fiat Ducato, Opel Movano and Peugeot Boxer. Back then, it said we’d see hydrogen versions of all those vehicles (as well as its smaller siblings) with maximum ranges of 500km (310 miles).\nThe decision to pull the plug came relatively late, with the company saying it was due to begin production at its plants in France and Poland “this summer.” It added the decision to kill the range will not impact staffing in production or R&D, with employees transferred to other projects. It will, however, have to delicately negotiate its exit with Symbio, the fuel cell maker it bought a one-third share of back in 2023.\nStellantis isn’t the first company that pledged to put its weight behind fuel cells only to pull back. Toyota has thrown a lot of time, effort and money behind hydrogen, believing fuel cells would be preferable to battery electric vehicles (BEVs). Sadly, as time progressed, the company has had to cede more and more of the market to batteries, and only advertises its third-generation fuel cell as a power unit for heavy industrial vehicles.\nHydrogen was, and has been for some time, an article of faith for fossil fuel companies, the car industry and even some countries that lack their own energy reserves. After all, the promise of being able to pull (theoretically limitless), emission-free energy out of water is the stuff of dreams. Not to mention, it requires much of the same knowledge and infrastructure used by the traditional oil and gas industry, and refueling can only take place at a commercial site.\nHad hydrogen made more of an impact, it would have likely preserved the status quo or something much like it, for those industries long into the future. But while the hope was that hydrogen could be a cleaner, greener substitute for oil and gas, its inherent flaws always made that a non-starter.\nFor instance, hydrogen is far less energy dense than oil and gas, and far less physically dense — it’s so prone to leaking that you have to go above and beyond to seal it in. It’s difficult to mass produce cleanly, especially if you want to power every car in the world, unless you use a dirty process like the steam reformation of methane. So, rather than moving away from fossil fuels and emissions, you’d be further entrenching them into the system and adding to the problem.\nAnd if you did want to just use renewable energy to pull hydrogen from water, then you’d require an unprecedented amount of investment. Back in 2021, I asked Tim Lord, who had previously been in charge of the UK’s decarbonization strategy, about that sort of industrial-scale hydrogen generation. He said that you’d essentially need to double your whole electricity generation output to get close.\nThat’s before you get to the other factors, like hydrogen’s efficiency as a store of energy or the investment necessary to equip every gas station on the planet with a hydrogen tank. Which is not likely going to pay off given that Toyota’s Mirai, arguably the flagship hydrogen fuel cell EV, has only sold 28,000 models since its launch in 2014. In the US market, there's only the Mirai, the Hyundai Nexo and the Honda CR-V e-FCEV knocking around, nothing compared to how many BEVs are on sale. I think it’s time for everyone to admit that we’re done with hydrogen fuel cell EVs and focus their attention elsewhere.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/another-big-car-company-gives-up-on-hydrogen-133011978.html?src=rss",

Research has linked skin issues like acne and psoriasis to the gut. Studies are also looking into how gut biome impacts reproductive health and hormone levels. Bearing that in mind, here are four things you can do to help keep it on the right track. Some common side effects of taking antibiotics include nausea, diarrhea and developing yeast infections. In addition to incorporating more yogurt or fermented foods into their diet, some people may seek a probiotic in hopes of balancing their gut, as they're designed to mimic an intact microbiota. Whole grains, fruits and vegetables are great food choices if you want to start healing your gut. If you dread running or don't have time to go to the gym, don't worry: There are small ways you can get your body in the habit of moving every day or at least more frequently. So if we're eating when our gut microbiome isn't ready, we won't be set up to properly process the nutrients of our food. Perhaps most fundamental is the fact that when we're exhausted, we don't have the energy to check off many of the things that keep us healthy, including exercising or finding a nutritious meal -- both of which impact our gut health."

    "summary": "Since rolling out the redesign of its Firefly app in April, Adobe has been releasing major updates for the generative AI hub at a near monthly clip. Today, the company is introducing a handful of new features to assist those who use Firefly's video capabilities.\nTo start, Adobe is making it easier to add sound effects to AI-generated clips. Right now, the majority of video models create footage without any accompanying audio. Adobe is addressing this with a nifty little feature that allows users to first describe the sound effect they want to generate and then record themselves making it. The second part isn't so Adobe's model can mimic the sound. Rather, it's so the system can get a better idea of the intensity and timing the user wants from the effect.\nIn the demo Adobe showed me, one of the company's employees used the feature to add the sound of a zipper being unzipped. They made a \"zzzztttt\" sound, which Adobe's model faithfully used to reproduce the effect at the intended volume. The translation was less convincing when the employee used the tool to add the sound of footsteps on concrete, though if you're using the feature for ideation as Adobe intended, that may not matter. When adding sound effects, there's a timeline editor along the bottom of the interface to make it easy to time the audio properly.\nAdobe\nThe other new features Adobe is adding today are called Composition Reference, Keyframe Cropping and Video Presets. The first of those allows you to upload a video or image you captured to guide the generation process. In combination with Video Presets, you can define the style of the final output. Some of the options Adobe is offering at launch allow you to create clips with anime, black and white or vector art styles. Lastly, with Keyframe Cropping you can upload the first and final frame of a video and select an aspect ratio. Firefly will then generate a video that stays within your desired format.\nIn June, Adobe added support for additional third-party models, and this month it's doing the same. Most notable is the inclusion of Veo 3, which Google premiered at its I/O 2025 conference in May. At the moment, Veo 3 is one of the only AI models that can generate video with sound. Like with all the other partner models Adobe offers in Firefly, Google has agreed not to use data from Adobe users for training future models. Every image and video people create through Firefly is digitally signed with the model that was used to create it. That is one of the safeguards Adobe includes so that Firefly customers don't accidentally ship an asset that infringes on copyrighted material.\nAccording to Zeke Koch, vice president of product management for Adobe Firefly, users can expect the fast pace of updates to continue. \"We're relentlessly shipping stuff almost as quickly as we can,\" he said. Koch adds Adobe will continue to integrate more third-party models, as long as their providers agree to the company's data privacy terms.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/adobe-firefly-can-now-generate-sound-effects-from-your-audio-cues-130008172.html?src=rss",

Today, the company is introducing a handful of new features to assist those who use Firefly's video capabilities. Right now, the majority of video models create footage without any accompanying audio. Adobe is addressing this with a nifty little feature that allows users to first describe the sound effect they want to generate and then record themselves making it. The other new features Adobe is adding today are called Composition Reference, Keyframe Cropping and Video Presets.

    "summary": "After several generations of iterative updates, it feels like Samsung tossed the Galaxy Z Fold 7 into a Hyperbolic Time Chamber to create a stunning device that's leaner, stronger and more powerful than before. The best part though is the phone looks and functions just like a regular handset now that there’s less bulk to lug around. But at a moment's notice, it can go Super Saiyan by opening up to reveal an even larger 8-inch display to become a true multimedia Raidboss. Unfortunately, it's still extremely expensive at $2,000. Though if you can handle the price, in a lot of ways, Samsung has finally achieved foldable phone nirvana with the Galaxy Z Fold 7.\nDesign: Chef's kiss\nWhen Samsung debuted its updated super sleek design language on the Galaxy S25 Edge, it felt like a novel way to reimagine the S25+ as a more engaging device. But when the company gave the same treatment to the Z Fold 7, that engineering became something truly transformative. Compared to its predecessor, Samsung's big foldable for 2025 is 10 percent lighter at just 215 grams. The bigger drop comes in thickness with Galaxy Z Fold 7 measuring a whopping 26 percent thinner (just 8.9mm when folded). This represents the biggest generation-over-generation decrease for the entire Z Fold line, which is kind of shocking considering it's happening seven years in. The result is a foldable that is basically the same size and weight as the Galaxy S25 Ultra (it's actually a little narrower), which is no mean feat for a class of gadgets that has been plagued by extra heft since they first came out. \n\n\nWhat might be just as impressive is that Samsung hasn't really cut corners to deliver the Z Fold 7's streamlined dimensions. You still get an IP48 rating for dust and water resistance (which can handle submersions of up to 5 feet for 30 minutes) along with Gorilla Glass Ceramic 2 in front and Gorilla Glass Victus 2 in back. Samsung also completely re-engineered its Armor FlexHinge, which glides open and closed like a dream. Samsung even says that Z Fold 7's ultra-thin glass is 50 percent thicker than before while also sporting a new titanium lattice that adds additional support and durability to the phone's flexible display.\nInside, Samsung has switched away from the under-display sensor used on previous models in favor of a more traditional hole-punch camera. This is a bit of a shame as it adds a small blemish to that otherwise gorgeous screen. However, with the panel now measuring 8 inches across (up from 7.6 on the Z Fold 6), there's more of it to enjoy even after you account for the small cutout. Plus, the move to a higher-res 10-megapixel sensor for this camera results in significantly better image quality than any of Samsung's under-display modules.\n\n\n\n\n  Sam Rutherford for Engadget\n \n\nThe one small design quirk is that sometimes the phone doesn't unfold all the way, often stopping just short at 179 degrees — much like the original Pixel Fold. That said, you can always make it go fully flat with a bit of extra pressure, though most of the time I don't even bother because this is the kind of thing that you don't really notice unless you're specifically looking for it.\nDisplays: Now even bigger, both inside and out\nAs for brightness and image quality, Samsung's panels are still unmatched. In addition to a larger main display, the Z Fold 7's exterior Cover Screen is slightly bigger at 6.5 inches. More importantly, it's noticeably wider too while sporting even thinner bezels, which makes the whole phone feel more usable. The feeling of holding a skinny baton I got on previous models is completely gone. Both screens also support a 120Hz refresh rate and can hit a peak brightness of 2,600 nits. And when compared to rivals like the Pixel 9 Pro Fold, the Fold 7's displays just pop a touch more thanks to slightly richer colors and saturation.\n\n\n\n\n  Sam Rutherford for Engadget\n \n\nAfter introducing S Pen integration on the Z Fold 3, Samsung has removed stylus support for this model — a big downgrade that may anger longtime Z Fold fans. The company claims it made this decision after seeing \"very low\" S Pen usage on previous generations, which frankly isn't all that surprising. But, as one of the highlight features that separated Samsung's big foldables from practically all of its rivals, it's still sad to see it go.\nPerformance and software: The fastest big foldable phone\nThe Galaxy Z Fold 7 unquestionably packs top-tier performance. It's powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chip along with 12GB or 16GB of RAM and up to 1TB of storage. Everything feels fast and snappy while OneUI 8 and Android 16 bring app optimizations that help make the most of the phone's big display.\n\n\n\n\n  Sam Rutherford for Engadget\n \n\nThe biggest eye-opener for me was when I compared how long it took the Z Fold 7 to launch my current favorite mobile game, Sword of Convallaria, against the Pixel 9 Pro Fold. Even with the increased performance of Google's recent Tensor chips, Samsung's foldable loaded the game in 13 seconds compared to 18 seconds for the Pixel. That might not sound like a ton, but it’s around 25 percent faster and when it's something you do multiple times a day, shaving off even a few seconds adds up fast..\nCameras: A major resolution bump\nWhile the Z Fold 7's ultrawide and 3x telephoto cameras are largely unchanged, the phone features a big photo upgrade thanks to a new 200MP sensor for its main camera. This is essentially the same component Samsung used in the S25 Ultra and S25 Edge, and it delivers a much-needed bump in image quality.\n\n\n\n\n  Sam Rutherford for Engadget\n \n\nIn bright light, the Z Fold 7 easily keeps pace with the Pixel 9 Pro Fold. In certain situations like when snapping pics of food, some may prefer its shots thanks to Samsung's warmer color profile. The phone still tends to oversharpen things, but colors are vibrant. For those who want to maximize resolution, you can select the phone's full 200MP mode (images are captured at 12MP by default). At night, the Fold 7's shots remained surprisingly sharp. I still prefer the Pixel 9 Pro Fold due to its more accurate white balance and often sharper focus, though Samsung's phone isn't far behind.\nPotentially the biggest shortcoming on the Fold 7 is that its 3x optical zoom can't quite match the 5x telephoto cam on the Pixel 9 Pro Fold. But for fans of group shots, Samsung added a new selfie camera with a wider 100-degree field of view.\nBattery life and charging: Solid longevity, but still only Qi 2 ready\nWhile the Z Fold 7's 4,400mAh battery is the same size as its predecessor, you will get slightly increased longevity due to improved power efficiency from its processor. In our local video rundown test, the Z Fold 7 lasted 20 hours and 50 minutes when using its main 8-inch display and 26 hours and 22 minutes with its exterior screen. Depending on which display you use, that's between 45 minutes and an hour longer than what we got from the previous model, which is nice to see considering battery life was already pretty solid.\n\n\n\n\n  Sam Rutherford for Engadget\n \n\nSadly, Samsung hasn't changed much when it comes to recharging. The Z Fold 7 supports wired charging at up to 25 watts — which is rather average for a modern flagship — alongside 15 watt wireless charging. And like the rest of the 2025 premium Galaxy line, this phone is merely Qi 2 ready, which means there's no built-in attachment system for magnetic accessories like charging pucks, card holders and battery packs. So if you want to use peripherals like those, you'll need to get a case with full support for Qi 2.\nWrap-up\nI've always said that Samsung is at its best when it focuses on hardware design, and the Galaxy Z Fold 7 may be one of the best examples of that. With its latest flagship foldable, Samsung has removed one of the remaining barriers preventing people from trying out the new breed of phones: excessive size and weight.\nBy widening its cover display, the Z Fold 7 looks and acts just like a regular smartphone, which is great for checking messages, looking up directions or snapping a photo. When you want to get really immersed in a show, movie or game, you can open up that beautiful flexible display, which is now even larger for your viewing pleasure. The phone’s higher-res main camera also brings upgraded image quality while its Snapdragon 8 Elite chip gives it a performance edge over rivals like the Pixel 9 Pro Fold.\n\n\n\n\n  Sam Rutherford for Engadget\n \n\nI don't love how Samsung is backtracking on features by removing S Pen support and reverting to an old-school camera cutout instead of an under-display sensor for its main display. But at least in the case of the latter, that change comes with much improved image quality, which is a big upgrade for video calls.\nWith the Galaxy Z Fold 7, you really do get the best of both worlds. Its new design is just as sleek as comparable traditional flagships while hiding a larger display that makes the need for small tablets obsolete. Unfortunately, with a starting price of $2,000, Samsung hasn't addressed the last roadblock stopping people from trying out a device that might completely change the way they use their phone.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review-foldable-phone-nirvana-for-a-price-123004636.html?src=rss",

Notably, Osika recently said on X that he is now an angel investor in a software startup that was ostensibly built with Lovable. Osika also celebrated that an app made by a large Brazilian edtech company using Lovable had grossed $3 million in 48 hours."

I also needed to shoot video on this trip, both for the CNET video that would run alongside my article, and to capture content for my personal photography YouTube channel. Sure, maybe the footage wasn't as cinematic as I'd normally try to achieve from my usual Canon R5, but it looked more than good enough and the DJI setup was far easier to carry around with me than a full-size mirrorless camera and lenses. That wasn't a problem, and I'm especially pleased with some of my imagery taken inside the company's battery testing area, which was a key subject of my written piece. Things got more dramatic as I joined Volvo in the frozen north of Sweden. It was amazing, especially when we stopped and got a brief glimpse of the northern lights overhead. I'd attached my DJI Osmo on a small clamp inside the car to film my efforts from multiple angles, but then it was time for me to do something a bit more dangerous. But that's fine, I needed only a few to illustrate my story. I shot many of the images on this trip using Leica's built-in Chrome color profile. Fujifilm's cameras (like the excellent X100VI) are famed for having a variety of stunning filmlike color profiles built in, so look toward those if you're keen on using in-camera colors."

The 2015 film from writer-director George Miller is set in a post-apocalyptic desert and is essentially a non-stop battle sequence where hero Max Rockatansky (Tom Hardy) teams up with Theron's Imperator Furiosa to wage battle against warlord Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne) and his army. You might want to catch Horizon: An American Saga -- Chapter One now; it's leaving Netflix July 15. After reconnecting, the two friends explore their friendship and wonder what might have been had Nora never left. Grug doesn't always welcome learning new things from a human and Eep's curious, sometimes rebellious ways also contribute to family disagreements. 20th Century Pictures Heat (1995) Michael Mann's 1995 movie Heat is most famous for being the first film in which acting titans Al Pacino and Robert De Niro appeared on screen in a scene together but it also features a fantastic performance from the late, great Val Kilmer. Taylour Paige, Colman Domingo and Glynn Turman all co-star in the film that was adapted from August Wilson's 1982 play. Rustin's outspoken activism and homosexuality made him a target -- not just for political adversaries but sometimes even among his allies. After surviving an encounter with Godzilla, he and others realize the kaiju is gearing up to attack Tokyo. (It feels impossible to imagine so many mega-stars assembling in one room for something like this today.)"

But just engineering a foldable phone isn't enough these days -- it has to be slim. And in this respect, Tecno is trying to thin the field. By contrast, the Huawei Mate XT Ultimate is 3.6mm at its thinnest point, and Samsung's latest two-panel Galaxy Z Fold 7 is 4.2mm thick when unfolded. When folded, Tecno's device measures 11.49mm, making it thinner than the Huawei's at 12.88mm but still chunky compared to non-folding phones like the iPhone 16 Pro (8.25mm) or the single-fold Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 (8.9mm). Thanks to a dual-cam design, that large hinge can be set in a partially folded configuration, presumably propping it up to do things like watch content or take video calls. That's pretty good for most phones, but it's unclear how much power will be siphoned by that big 9.49-inch display in regular use. When looking at the Mate XT Ultimate last year, CNET's Sareena Dayaram felt that its 5,600-mAh battery could be an issue due to the large inner screen. While the latest mobile silicon can handle multiple screens, we'll wait to see if the Ultimate G Fold can run apps well with its unique display system. There's also no anticipated price or shipping target; Tecno expects to showcase it at Mobile World Congress 2026."

There are AirPods clones with stems, and stemless \"dot-style\" buds like the Final Audio ZE3000 SV. That happened after Bose popularized this design with its $300 Ultra Open Earbuds and factories in China went into overdrive to create cheap knockoffs. While clip-on earbuds first started appearing in Asia several months (or even longer) before the Ultra Open Earbuds were released, Bose not only vastly improved upon the design and performance of early clip-on models, but it also did a bang-up job marketing them as a \"totally new kind of wearable device.\" When I asked Anker's PR rep about how it developed its products, he came back with: \"We respectfully decline to comment.\" As a reviewer, it gets even trickier when the specs of two models from competing brands look nearly identical. Based in Kawasaki City, Japan, Final Audio is geared toward audiophiles and specializes in earphones and headphones that range from its flagship $4,000 D8000 planar magnetic open-back headphones to those aforementioned entry-level ZE3000 SV buds that are priced near the top of the \"budget\" range at $100. Final saved tons of R&D cost here, and is obviously having a greater profit margin than Roseselsa. This setup benefited factories, as they could sell the same package to multiple brands and recoup development costs more easily. But my travels through this world have taught me that there's more nuance and variation to product development than I thought."

Netflix really could have blown this category out and had some fun with it. Also missing from Netflix's list are the documentary Sweet Bobby: My Catfish Nightmare, about one woman's years-long relationship with a man who didn't exist, the kinda-weird Irish crime drama Bodkin, the Japanese series Asura about four sisters whose lives are thrown into chaos when their dad's affair is discovered, or the Mexican erotic drama Playing With Fire. Every woman on each of these shows is a mess or is dealing with one in some way or another; they absolutely deserve to be included. Nothing messier than One of Them Days (friendship/rent is due mess), To All The Boys I've Loved Before (romantic mess), or documentaries like Con Mum or A Deadly American Marriage (real-life mess). I'm all for trendy, zeitgeisty slang (if for no other reason than to make my kids uncomfortable when I use it), so messy girl summer doesn't bother me, but it did make me realize that when you're labeling women, messy is an easy shorthand for the Venn overlap of \"flawed\" and \"chaotic.\" For shows about men like that, I suggest Dept.

However, the Supreme Court overturned the decision and ordered a re-trial. As a result of that, Lee was handed a 30-month prison sentence and served 18 months before being paroled. Then-South Korea President Yoon Suk Yeol (who was removed from office this year and recently rearrested over a failed martial law attempt in 2024) later pardoned Lee.\nWhile the Supreme Court's ruling had been widely expected, it clears \"a layer of legal uncertainty\" related to Samsung, one analyst said. It will allow Lee to focus more of his attention on Samsung, which earlier this month projected a 56 percent drop in operating profit for the April-June quarter compared with the same period in 2024.

However, the Supreme Court overturned the decision and ordered a re-trial. As a result of that, Lee was handed a 30-month prison sentence and served 18 months before being paroled. Then-South Korea President Yoon Suk Yeol (who was removed from office this year and recently rearrested over a failed martial law attempt in 2024) later pardoned Lee."

    "summary": "Roblox is joining the growing ranks of online platforms that are trying to better understand the ages of their teen users. The company is rolling out a new \"age estimation\" feature for teens 13 and older.\nWith the update, teens will be prompted for an age check that requires a video selfie in order to access its new less restrictive chat feature called \"trusted connections.\" Roblox is relying on third-party identity company Persona for the actual \"estimation,\" and users who fail the check will also have the option of providing an ID. Once teens have \"unlocked\" trusted connections via video selfie or sharing an ID, they'll be able to participate in chats with friends \"without filters,\" including \"party\" group text and voice chats.\nRoblox has previously faced scrutiny for not policing its chat features enough and making it too easy for adults to seek out children on the platform. The company notes in its announcement that parents will be able to monitor their kids' \"trusted connections\" via parental control features, and that the feature is intended only for people who teens already \"know and trust.\" Teens are only able to add trusted connections via their existing contacts list or a QR code.\n\"We believe chat without filters should only be accessible to users who have verified their age.\" the company writes in a blog post. \"This isn’t just about compliance; it’s about building engaging and appropriate digital spaces for everyone.\"\nWhile Roblox is notably not using the term \"age verification,\" the new feature comes at a time when there are increasing calls for social media companies and other platforms to check the ages of their youngest users. Reddit and Bluesky recently announced age verification features for users in the UK  — a change required of major platforms ahead of a new online safety law going into effect. Age verification mandates have also been gaining steam in the United States.\nA number of states have introduced age verification measures for social media, though laws in Arkansas and Utah have so far been blocked. Utah also recently passed a law requiring app stores to verify users' ages — an approach that has been endorsed by companies like Meta and Snap. And the Supreme Court recently upheld a Texas law that requires websites hosting adult to conduct age verification checks.\nRoblox, which unlike most online platforms allows children under 13 to have accounts, is in a slightly different position. And for now, it's billing its age checks as \"optional.\" But already having an age estimation feature in place could certainly be useful should it be required to take an even stricter approach in the future.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/roblox-is-adding-an-age-estimation-feature-for-teens-110047092.html?src=rss",

If you deposit $10,000 into a one-year CD that earns 4.40% APY (the top APY from our list), it would be worth $10,440.00 at maturity. Watch out One of the biggest trade-offs for most CDs is early withdrawal penalties. And that's not counting the interest you'll earn on top of your savings. Although savings accounts have variable interest rates -- meaning they can rise and fall based on the economy and your bank's discretion -- experts expect savings rates will remain high all year.

Some devices, like the Meta Quest 3, are entirely standalone, which means you don't need anything but the headset itself to use it. Other VR headsets need to be connected to a system from which it can draw power and run software. Some systems, like the HP Reverb G2, must connect to a PC, while others like the PS VR2 can connect to gaming consoles like the PS5. Most VR headsets come with the basic controllers you'll need to control actions and movement in virtual worlds. \nWhat's the difference between PC VR, Smartphone VR and Gaming Console VR?\nThe main difference between those three VR systems is the main machine that allows the VR headset to run. PC VR headsets require a PC, like a gaming laptop or desktop, to run, while smartphone and gaming console VR systems require smartphones and gaming consoles, respectively, to work.\nDo all VR headsets need a phone?\nNo, not all VR headsets need a phone to work. Many VR headsets have build in displays that sit in front of your eyes and basically act as your window into the virtual world.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/best-vr-accessories-150021126.html?src=rss",

TikTok said that it surveyed over 870 songwriters and interviewed several to understand their needs in relation to profile building and creating monetization opportunities. The company also pointed to an independent survey, which indicated that more than half of songwriters who use social media to promote their profile use TikTok to do it. “TikTok is unique in its ability to offer songwriters a way to highlight their musical works alongside their own content, helping them to tell stories about their music, their craft, and their lives, and to raise their profile and build their audience on TikTok, as hundreds of thousands of artist creators already do,” TikTok’s Global Head of Music Publishing Licensing and Partnership Jordan Lowy said in a statement. TikTok joins streaming services like Spotify, which has let songwriters highlight their work for years now. Last year, Tidal launched a tool to let musicians track royalties and manage their work for which they have songwriting credits. While TikTok decided to shut down its music streaming service, TikTok Music, last year, the platform still remains important for users to discover new music and for artists to promote their tracks. Earlier this year, the company released a TikTok for Artists tool that lets artists monitor the performance of their campaign and tracks."

Carr has threatened to investigate companies for their diversity, equity and inclusion policies and committed to not approving any mergers of companies that insist on keeping them. \nThe FCC is expected to vote on the new rules on August 7.

    "summary": "On Tuesday, Nintendo published an interview with the creators of Donkey Kong Bananza. The second big Switch 2 tentpole title comes from the team that made Super Mario Odyssey. The developers explained how they laid the foundation for DK's first 3D adventure since the Nintendo 64 era.\nDestruction is at the heart of Donkey Kong Bananza. Everything in his environment can be smashed to bits. Not only is that a fun mechanic, but it also adds an element of verticality and freedom of exploration. That's an ideal fit for showcasing the Switch 2's processing power.\nNintendo\nAs with so many other Nintendo creations, the first step in getting there was a no-brainer. Consult with Shigeru Miyamoto.\n\"We'd built up a lot of expertise in gameplay development for 3D action games through our work on 3D Mario games, including Super Mario Odyssey,\" producer Kenta Motokura said. \"But we needed to dive deeper into the fundamental question of 'What is Donkey Kong?' So, our first step was to seek out Miyamoto-san and Nintendo Executive Officer Yoshiaki Koizumi.\"\nIn their talk, Miyamoto emphasized DK's moves like hand slaps and blowing. Along similar lines, Koizumi pointed to the ape's massive arms, which he uses to punch and hoist heavy objects. That got the team thinking. After all, who doesn't want to control a giant ape who runs around, breaking shit?\nDK slapping a platform in the 2010 game Donkey Kong Country Returns. Shigeru Miyamoto emphasized the move as a starting point for the new version.Nintendo / Retro\nThe Super Mario Odyssey team was uniquely suited to handle that challenge. First, the 2017 title included some light environmental destruction. (Think the cheese rocks in the Luncheon Kingdom and Bowser's smashing in the final level.)\nThe team experimented with fully destructible environments soon after Odyssey's release. (That was long before they knew they'd make a Donkey Kong game.) That included the adorably strange idea of putting smashing fists on a Goomba and setting it loose. Part two of the interview includes a short video of one of these tests.\nOn a technical level, the key to that mechanic is using voxels (3D pixels). \"In Super Mario Odyssey, we started using voxels midway through development, so the areas where we could apply them were limited,\" Motukura said. \"But the trial and error we went through back then directly led to what we were able to do in Donkey Kong Bananza.\"\nAnother interesting tidbit from the interview is that they started working on the game as a Switch 1 title. \"We originally began developing Donkey Kong Bananza on Nintendo Switch, but we ran into some challenges,\" Motokura said. \"I think it was around 2021 when we started to think about moving development to Switch 2.\" In the comparison image below, you can see a much richer environment in the Switch 2 version.\nNintendo\nArt director Daisuke Watanabe explained that the new console's hardware opened new doors. \"We first looked into how we could upgrade what we'd originally built for Switch to take advantage of Switch 2,\" Watanabe said. \"One of the most obvious improvements was that we could place far more objects in the environment than before. Being able to place more objects in the terrain didn't just enhance the game's visual richness. More importantly, it increased the amount of things players could destroy, which amplified the exhilaration of being able to demolish anything and everything.\"\nThere are many more nuggets in Nintendo's interview. This includes animal transformations and Pauline's role in the game. (She must be the forgiving type, given how they started.) The chat also explores how DK's modern art style evolved.\nYou can visit Nintendo's website for the full lowdown. Donkey Kong Bananza will be available tomorrow, July 17.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/donkey-kong-bananzas-creators-reflect-on-the-games-path-to-delightful-destruction-201600462.html?src=rss",

But it sounds like we’re going to have to wait a while to see that side of the story unfold.\nSpeaking to Variety off the back of The Last of Us netting HBO 16 Emmy nominations this week, the company’s CEO, Casey Bloys, said season three is \"definitely planned for 2027.\" Bloys didn’t offer any more specific information about the release window, but the next batch of episodes arriving in the first half of 2027 would be consistent with the roughly two-year gap between seasons one and two.\nThe HBO Max chief also told Variety that a decision has yet to be made on whether the remaining chunk of narrative from The Last of Us Part II will be adapted into more than one additional season. Bloys said that the decision is being left to showrunner Craig Mazin. Mazin’s decision likely won’t involve input from Neil Druckmann, though. The Naughty Dog studio head and co-creator of the eponymous video game series stepped away from his role on the show after season two. But Bloys unsurprisingly doesn’t think (publicly at least) that Druckmann’s departure will affect the development of season three.\n\"It was fantastic to have Neil involved. A lot of people don’t realize that Neil has a full time job creating video games and running Naughty Dog. It’s a really big job that he’s got. So I understand why he needs to focus on that,\" he told Variety. \"But I believe he’s given us a good blueprint with the show. And obviously Craig is a pro, so I think we’ll be in excellent shape. I’m not worried at all.\"\nIf you are looking for a way to bridge the gap between now and what could be the final season of The Last of Us, a replay of the game it’s based on might be the way to go. Last week, Naughty Dog introduced a new Chronological Mode to the remastered version of the sequel that ditches the game’s frequent flashback sequences to focus on Ellie and Abby’s respective Seattle plotlines as they unfold.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/hbo-confirms-the-last-of-us-season-3-will-arrive-in-2027-161150871.html?src=rss",
    "full_text": "If you’re all caught up on The Last of Us (the TV version that is) then you’ll know that season two made clear that when the show returns it will focus a lot more on Kaitlyn’s Dever’s Abby. Speaking to Variety off the back of The Last of Us netting HBO 16 Emmy nominations this week, the company’s CEO, Casey Bloys, said season three is \"definitely planned for 2027.\" The HBO Max chief also told Variety that a decision has yet to be made on whether the remaining chunk of narrative from The Last of Us Part II will be adapted into more than one additional season. Bloys said that the decision is being left to showrunner Craig Mazin. But Bloys unsurprisingly doesn’t think (publicly at least) that Druckmann’s departure will affect the development of season three. \"It was fantastic to have Neil involved. A lot of people don’t realize that Neil has a full time job creating video games and running Naughty Dog. \"But I believe he’s given us a good blueprint with the show. And obviously Craig is a pro, so I think we’ll be in excellent shape. I’m not worried at all.\""

    "summary": "Mac owners will soon be able to play one of the biggest games of the last five years or so. Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition will be available in the Mac App Store as well as Steam, GOG.com and the Epic Games Store on Thursday, July 17. As the name implies, it includes both the base game as well as the Phantom Liberty expansion from 2023. The port was announced last fall and was originally planned to arrive \"early\" this year, but it took a little longer to get everything squared away.\nUnsurprisingly, you'll need an M-series Mac to play this game, but Apple and CD Projekt Red confirm that it'll work on computers all the way back to the M1 — but you'll need 16GB of RAM. For years, 8GB was the standard on entry-level Macs, so those computers will be out of luck. And of course, graphics fidelity will vary widely across the various supported chipsets, but CD Projekt Red is including a \"for this Mac\" graphics preset that is optimized for each Apple Silicon-based Mac. So at the very least, you shouldn't have to fuss around with settings too much to get a decent experience.\nShortly after the initial announcement, CD Projekt Red provided more details on the \"for this Mac\" setting as well as recommended specs. While the game does work with an M1 Mac, you're capped at 30fps and a low resolution — things escalate rapidly from there. The recommended configuration calls for an M3 Pro chip with 18GB of RAM to hit 60fps at 1080p. That configuration supports Ray Tracing, but regardless of what you're using you'll need to turn it on manually. \nCD Projekt Red\nThings go up from there, with 36GB of RAM and either an M2 Ultra or M3 Max chip to run high fidelity; very high fidelity requires an M3 Ultra or M4 Max. That essentially means you have a $2,000 or up Mac Studio or a $3,200 and up MacBook Pro with the M4 Max if you want to run this game at the highest of settings. Of course, if you care about such things, you probably already have a good gaming PC. \nAs for other technical goodies, the game utilizes AMD FSR for upscaling and frame generation, and Apple's MetalFX also provides upscaling as well. Upcoming Metal 4 features announced at WWDC 2025, including Metal FX Frame Interpolation and Metal FX Denoising, are coming to the game via a future update. Metal FX Frame Interpolation generates an intermediate frame for every two input frames and can be combined with existing Metal upscaling to allow the game to hit 120fps on Ultra settings — but again, we're not sure what specific models will support that.\nIf you use AirPods with your Mac, Cyberpunk 2077 features spatial audio with head-tracking features. And the game supports cross-progression regardless of what platform you play on, which should be useful for anyone who started a game elsewhere and wants to pick it back up on a Mac. If you've already purchased Cyberpunk 2077 from another storefront like Steam, it'll automatically be available for Mac.\nWhile Cyberpunk 2077 isn't exactly a new game, it remains one of the more popular and lauded titles of the decade (at least after CD Projekt Red fixed numerous launch bugs). And it joins a still small but growing number of major games optimized for Apple Silicon and the Mac, including the recently-released Assassin's Creed Shadows. A quick look on the Mac App Store also shows AAA releases including Death Stranding, Control, Lies of P, numerous Resident Evil titles as well as smaller but no less awesome games like Neva and Stray. Most big-name games don't come to the Mac at the same time as other platforms still, but the Mac is an option for more than just Apple Arcade games.\nUpdate, July 16, 2025, 11:44AM ET: This story has been updated with more details from the developer on the different specs required to hit the varying performance tiers in Cyberpunk 2077.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition-comes-to-the-mac-on-july-17-130047453.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Whether you’re shopping for a budget-friendly laptop for school or a sleek machine for everyday productivity, the best Chromebooks can offer surprising functionality for the price. Chromebooks have come a long way from their early days as web-only devices. Now, many Chromebook models feature powerful processors, premium displays and even touchscreen support, making them a compelling alternative to a regular laptop for plenty of users.There are more options than ever too, from lightweight clamshells to high-end, 2-in-1 designs that can easily replace your daily driver. Whether you're after a new Chromebook for streaming, work or staying on top of emails, there’s likely a model that fits both your budget and your workflow. We’ve tested the top Chromebooks on the market to help you find the right one — whether you’re after maximum value or top-tier performance.Editor’s note (7/16/25): While I still recommend everything in this guide, there’s one very intriguing new Chromebook I’m in the process of testing. Lenovo, who makes our pick for best overall Chromebook, just released a new premium model. The Chromebook Plus 14 starts at $649 and is the one of the first to use the ARM-based MediaTek Kompanio Ultra 910 chip. Most other performance-focused Chromebooks run on Intel or AMD chips, but so far the Kompanio Ultra has been more than up to what I’ve thrown at it. And the other benefit is battery life — Lenovo promises up to 17 hours. I haven’t fully tested this yet, but from what I’ve seen the ARM chip is unsurprisingly much more efficient than the Intel ones I use on most other Chromebooks. I’m hopeful that this laptop will last for 10 hours of real use, not just playing back video or some other low-power task.Design-wise, it has more in common with Google’s old Pixelbook Go or even a MacBook Air than most other Chromebooks. It's pleasantly thin (.63 inches) and light (2.58 pounds). It also features a 14-inch OLED display, 256GB of storage and 16GB of RAM. The model I’m testing costs $749, but there’s also a $649 configuration with 12GB of RAM, 128GB of storage and no touchscreen — but it uses the same chip, still has an OLED screen and should get similarly long battery life. The relatively high price makes me hesitate on calling this the best Chromebook for everyone, but it’ll almost certainly be the Chromebook to buy if you care about battery life. I’ll update this guide again once I finish my testing.\nTable of contents\n\nBest Chromebooks in 2025\nLenovo IdeaPad Flex 5i Chromebook Plus\nAcer Chromebook Plus 514\nAcer Chromebook Plus Spin 714\nAcer Chromebook Plus 516 GE\nBest Chromebooks FAQs\nOther Chromebooks we tested\n\nBest Chromebooks in 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBest Chromebooks FAQs\nWhat is Chrome OS, and why would I use it over Windows?\nThis is probably the number one question about Chromebooks. There are plenty of inexpensive Windows laptops on the market, so why bother with Chrome's operating system? Glad you asked. For me, the simple and clean nature of Chrome OS is a big selling point. Chrome OS is based on Google’s Chrome browser, which means most of the programs you can run are web based. There’s no bloatware or unwanted apps to uninstall like you often get on Windows laptops, it boots up in seconds, and you can completely reset to factory settings almost as quickly. \nOf course, simplicity will also be a major drawback for some users. Not being able to install native software can be a dealbreaker if you’re a video editor or software developer. But there are also plenty of people who do the majority of their work in a web browser, using tools like Google Docs and spreadsheets for productivity without needing a full Windows setup.\nGoogle and its software partners are getting better every year at supporting more advanced features. For example, Google added video editing tools to the Google Photos app on Chromebooks – it won’t replace Adobe Premiere, but it should be handy for a lot of people. Similarly, Google and Adobe announced Photoshop on the web in 2023, something that brings much of the power of Adobe’s desktop apps to Chromebooks.\nChromebooks can also run Android apps, which greatly expands the amount of software available. The quality varies widely, but it means you can do more with a Chromebook beyond just web-based apps. For example, you can install the Netflix app and save videos for offline watching. Other Android apps like Microsoft Office and Adobe Lightroom are surprisingly capable as well. Between Android apps and a general improvement in web apps, Chromebooks are more than just portals to a browser.\nWhat do Chromebooks do well?\n\n\n\n\nPut simply, web browsing and really anything web based. Online shopping, streaming music and video and using various social media sites are among the most common daily tasks people do on Chromebooks. As you might expect, they also work well with Google services like Photos, Docs, Gmail, Drive, Keep and so on. Yes, any computer that can run Chrome can do that too, but the lightweight nature of Google Chrome OS makes it a responsive and stable platform.\nAs I mentioned before, Chrome OS can run Android apps, so if you’re an Android user you’ll find some nice ties between the platforms. You can get most of the same apps that are on your phone on a Chromebook and keep info in sync between them. You can also use some Android phones as a security key for your Chromebook or instantly tether your 2-in-1 laptop to use mobile data.\nGoogle continues to tout security as a major differentiator for Chromebooks, and it’s definitely a factor worth considering. Auto-updates are the first lines of defense: Chrome OS updates download quickly in the background and a fast reboot is all it takes to install the latest version. Google says that each webpage and app on a Chromebook runs in its own sandbox as well, so any security threats are contained to that individual app. Finally, Chrome OS has a self-check called Verified Boot that runs every time a device starts up. Beyond all this, the simple fact that you generally can’t install traditional apps on a Chromebook means there are fewer ways for bad actors to access the system.\nIf you’re interested in Google’s Gemini AI tools, a Chromebook is a good option as well. Every Chromebook in our top picks comes with a full year of Google’s AI Pro plan — this combines the usual Google One perks like 2TB of storage and 10 percent back in purchases from the Google Store with a bunch of AI tools. You’ll get access to Gemini in Chrome, Gmail, Google Docs and other apps, Gemini 2.5 Pro in the Gemini app and more. Given that this plan is $20/month, it’s a pretty solid perk. Chromebook Plus models also include tools like the AI-powered “help me write,” the Google Photos Magic Editor and generative AI backgrounds you can create by filling in a few prompts.\nAs for when to avoid Chromebooks, the answer is simple: If you rely heavily on a specific native application for Windows or a Mac, chances are you won’t find the exact same option on a ChromeOS device. That’s most true in fields like photo and video editing, but it can also be the case in law or finance. Plenty of businesses run on Google’s G suite software, but more still have specific requirements that a Chromebook might not match. If you’re an iPhone user, you’ll also miss out on the way the iPhone easily integrates with an iPad or Mac. For me, the big downside is not being able to access iMessage on a Chromebook.\nFinally, gaming Chromebooks are not ubiquitous, although they’re becoming a slightly more reasonable option with the rise of cloud gaming. In late 2022, Google and some hardware partners announced a push to make Chromebooks with cloud gaming in mind. From a hardware perspective, that means laptops with bigger screens that have higher refresh rates as well as optimizing those laptops to work with services like NVIDIA GeForce Now, Xbox Game Pass and Amazon Luna. You’ll obviously need an internet connection to use these services, but the good news is that playing modern games on a Chromebook isn’t impossible. You can also install Android games from the Google Play Store, but that’s not what most people are thinking of when they want to game on a laptop.\nWhat are the most important specs for a Chromebook?\n\n\n\n\nChrome OS is lightweight and runs well on fairly modest hardware, so the most important thing to look for might not be processor power or storage space. But Google made it easier to get consistent specs and performance late last year when it introduced the Chromebook Plus initiative. Any device with a Chromebook Plus designation meets some minimum requirements, which happen to be very similar to what I’d recommend most people get if they’re looking for the best laptop they can use every day.\nChromebook Plus models have at least a 12th-gen Intel Core i3 processor, or an AMD Ryzen 3 7000 series processor, both of which should be more than enough for most people. These laptops also have a minimum of 8GB of RAM and 128GB of SSD storage, which should do the trick unless you’re really pushing your Chromebook. All Chromebook Plus models have to have a 1080p webcam, which is nice in these days of constant video calling, and they also all have to have at least a 1080p FHD IPS screen.\nOf course, you can get higher specs or better screens if you desire, but I’ve found that basically everything included in the Chromebook Plus target specs makes for a very good experience.\nGoogle has an Auto Update policy for Chromebooks as well, and while that’s not exactly a spec, it’s worth checking before you buy. Last year, Google announced that Chromebooks would get software updates and support for an impressive 10 years after their release date. This support page lists the Auto Update expiration date for virtually every Chromebook ever, but a good rule of thumb is to buy the newest machine you can to maximize your support.\nHow much should I spend on a Chromebook?\nChromebooks started out notoriously cheap, with list prices often coming in under $300. But as they’ve gone more mainstream, they’ve transitioned from being essentially modern netbooks to some of the best laptops you’ll want to use all day. As such, prices have increased: At this point, you should expect to spend at least $400 if you want a solid daily driver. There are still many Chromebooks out there available at a low price that may be suitable as secondary devices, but a good Chromebook that can be an all-day, every-day laptop will cost more. But, notably, even the best Chromebooks usually cost less than the best Windows laptops, or even the best “regular” laptops out there.\nThere are a handful of premium Chromebooks that approach or even exceed $1,000 that claim to offer better performance and more processing power, but I don’t recommend spending that much. Generally, that’ll get you a better design with more premium materials, as well as more powerful internals and extra storage space, like a higher-capacity SSD. Of course, you also sometimes pay for the brand name. But, the specs I outlined earlier are usually enough, and there are multiple good premium Chromebooks in the $700 to $800 range at this point.\nSee Also:\n\nBest Laptops for 2025\nBest Gaming Laptops\nBest 2-in-1 Laptops for 2025\nBest Cheap Windows Laptops\nBest Laptops for College Students \n\nOther Chromebooks we tested\nSamsung Galaxy Chromebook Plus\nSamsung’s Galaxy Chromebook Plus, released in late 2024, is one of the more unique Chromebooks out there. It’s extremely thin and light, at 0.46 inches and 2.6 pounds, but it manages to include a 15.6-inch display in that frame. That screen is a 1080p panel that’s sharp and bright, but its 16:9 aspect ratio made things feel a bit cramped when scrolling vertically. Performance is very good, and the keyboard is solid, though I’m not a fan of the number pad as it shifts everything to the left. At $700 it’s not cheap, but that feels fair considering its size and capabilities. If you’re looking for a big screen laptop that is also super light, this Chromebook merits consideration, even if it’s not the best option for everyone.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/best-chromebooks-160054646.html?src=rss",
    "full_text": "Most other performance-focused Chromebooks run on Intel or AMD chips, but so far the Kompanio Ultra has been more than up to what I’ve thrown at it. I’m hopeful that this laptop will last for 10 hours of real use, not just playing back video or some other low-power task. Design-wise, it has more in common with Google’s old Pixelbook Go or even a MacBook Air than most other Chromebooks. This means you get more vertical screen real estate, which is something I appreciate over a standard 1080p display. At 3.5 pounds and 0.78 inches thick, it’s definitely not the lightest or slimmest option out there. The latest Spin 714 costs $700 – not an unreasonable price for a computer with these specs and built quality. Plenty of businesses run on Google’s G suite software, but more still have specific requirements that a Chromebook might not match. You can also install Android games from the Google Play Store, but that’s not what most people are thinking of when they want to game on a laptop.

    "summary": "Apple's Irish tax break problems are officially over. Ireland's Department of Finance has reported that the entirety of the €14.25 billion fund in Apple's escrow account for the case has been fully transferred to the Exchequer or Ireland's central fund. The escrow account has, therefore, been closed. This marks the end of one of the world's largest antitrust cases that started way back in 2013 when the European Commission launched an investigation to determine whether Apple was enjoying better tax rates than warranted under the bloc's laws. \nThe commission found that the tax breaks Ireland gave Apple back then was illegal shortly after its investigation started. Then in 2016, after years of investigation, the commission ruled that the company had to pay back the \"illegal state aid\" it received over a 10-year-period before the probe into its tax practices was launched, since it was given \"significant advantage\" over its rivals. \nApparently, Apple created Irish subsidiaries that owned most of its intellectual properties. Every time the company sells a product, the Irish subsidiaries get paid for the use of Apple's IPs. And thanks to the company's agreement with Ireland, Apple was only paying a 1 percent tax rate on European profits that became as low as .005 percent in 2014. The Commission ordered Apple to pay back the €13.1 billion in taxes it owed from between 2003 and 2014, with an interest of €1.2 billion on top. \nIn 2018, the company transferred €14.3 billion to an escrow account as it appealed the Commission's ruling. The EU's General Court ruled in Apple's favor in 2020, explaining that there wasn't enough evidence to show that the company had broken the bloc's rules. But in 2024, the European Court of Justice overturned that decision and confirmed the Commission's original ruling in 2016. \nAs The Irish Times has reported, the funds continued depreciating in value since it was deposited into escrow until 2023. It only managed to regain €470 million within 16 months before the account's closure in May, thanks to higher interest rates and investments with higher yields. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/apples-%E2%82%AC143-billion-irish-tax-break-case-is-officially-over-113755771.html?src=rss",

Pick any category you can think of and Netflix probably has something that will fit the bill, including original programming. Plus, new content is released every week and as a worldwide service, Netflix is consistently adding movies and TV shows from around the globe that can change the viewing experience in ways you may not have considered (Are you sure you’re not into K-Dramas, Finnish detective thrillers or British home improvement shows? That doesn’t mean it’s always simple to choose something to watch, but when it comes to swapping profiles or simply picking up where you left off, it doesn’t get better than this. If you’re heading off the grid — or onto a plane — then you can easily download most (but not all) of its content to watch on your iOS or Android device. The other thing to keep in mind is that maybe if you’ve let your account lapse, the service that exists now is very different from what you would’ve seen two years ago, or five, or ten. Remaining the dominant player in subscription streaming has required adjustments to stay on top with a changing mix of content and plans to choose from. In the US, there are three levels of Netflix you can subscribe to. All of them include unlimited access to the same content, work on the same devices and you can cancel or pause them at any time. The difference between Standard ($15.50 per month) and Premium ($23 per month) comes down to picture quality and the amount of simultaneous streams allowed."

    "summary": "The best soundbars can completely transform your TV setup, turning flat, lifeless audio into something that actually sounds cinematic. Whether you're watching blockbuster movies, listening to music or gaming, a good soundbar delivers clearer vocals, deep bass and better overall playback than most built-in TV speakers ever could.In 2025, there’s a soundbar for every kind of home entertainment setup — from compact all-in-one units to full surround systems with subwoofers and rear speakers. Some prioritize simplicity and sleek design, while others are packed with immersive features like Dolby Atmos and smart voice controls. No matter your budget or your space, we’ve picked the best soundbars you can buy right now to help elevate your audio experience.\nTable of contents\n\nThe post-CES soundbar outlook for 2025\nBest soundbars for 2025\nWhat to look for in a soundbar \nOther soundbars we tested\nBest soundbar FAQs\n\nThe post-CES soundbar outlook for 2025\nI typically come out of CES with a pretty clear understanding of the new soundbars that are coming for the year, but that wasn’t exactly the case in 2025. LG decided to carry over its most premium soundbars from 2024, but it will add the compact S20A this year. The company only previewed the model at CES, so full specs are still forthcoming. \nSamsung will once again keep the same overall design and features for its top-end Q990 soundbar. However, the company is adding a few new tools and it drastically reduced the size of the wireless subwoofer that comes in the box. Samsung does have one new model for 2025, the QS700F, that’s designed to sit on a table or automatically adjust to being mounted flat on a wall. Details are scarce on that soundbar for now and I anticipate a full spec sheet when the company is really to sell it.\nOf the big three TV companies, Sony is the only one that didn’t announce any home theater gear at CES. The company has decided to focus mainly on its automotive efforts at the show recently, leaving TV and audio announcements for later in the year. The company debuted multiple soundbar options in 2024 and a four-speaker setup for the living room in the Bravia Quad. That said, it wouldn’t surprise me if Sony released new soundbars later in the year since its most recent models were only announced last April.\nOne company I would keep an eye on is Sennheiser. The original Ambeo model is nearly six years old and could use a refresh. The company has added medium and mini options to the Ambeo lineup since then, but it would be nice to see a refined version of the largest model too. The original Ambeo soundbar is huge, so no matter how good it sounds, it will always be a tough sell for some people.\nAlthough I think it’s less likely, it’s also possible that Sonos has new soundbars this year. While the company’s next device will likely be the rumored set-top streaming box, the Sound Motion tech inside the Arc Ultra would offer a big improvement to bass performance in compact models like the Beam and Ray. The company may bring Sound Motion to standalone speakers first, but it’s destined for those smaller soundbars eventually.\nThe best soundbars for 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat to look for in a soundbar\nFeatures\nWhen it comes to features, the more you pay the more you're going to get in your new audio system. Most affordable options ($150 or less) will improve your television's audio quality, but that's about it. Step into the $300 to $400 range and you'll find all-in-one soundbars with things like built-in voice control, wireless connectivity, Google Chromecast, AirPlay 2 and even Android TV. They're all helpful when you want to avoid looking for the remote control, but the best playback quality is usually only in the top tier and the formats those premium soundbar systems support. I’m talking about things like Dolby Atmos, DTS:X and other high-resolution audio standards — essentials if you’re building a truly cinematic home entertainment setup. And not all Atmos soundbars are equal, so you'll need to look at the finer details carefully before you break into the savings account. If you're looking for one of the best Dolby Atmos soundbars, size, channels and subwoofer options will be important factors to consider. Some models even include a dedicated subwoofer to enhance bass performance, bringing an extra punch to action scenes and soundtracks.\nPorts\n\n\n\n\nThis is a big one. A lot of the more affordable soundbars are limited when it comes to connectivity options. They either offer an optical port or one HDMI jack and, if you're lucky, both. Things get slightly better in the mid-range section, but that's not always the case. The Sonos Beam, for example, is $449, but only has a single HDMI port. Even at the higher-end, the $899 Sonos Arc still only has one HDMI port. If you plan to connect multiple devices like a set-top box, gaming laptop or console directly to your soundbar for the best audio experience, you’ll want an option with at least two HDMI (eARC) inputs. HDMI connections are critical for supporting Dolby Atmos and Dolby Digital audio formats, as well as high-res passthrough for HDR and 8K/4K content.\nChannels\nAnother big thing you’ll want to pay attention to when looking for the best soundbar is channels. That’s the 2.1, 7.1.2 or other decimal number that companies include in product descriptions. The first figure corresponds to the number of channels. A two would just be left and right while a more robust Atmos system, especially one with rear surround speakers, could be five or seven (left, right, center and upward). The second number refers to the dedicated subwoofer, so if your new soundbar comes with one or has them built in, you’ll see one here. The third numeral is up-firing speakers, important for the immersive effect of Dolby Atmos. Not all Atmos-enabled units have them, but if they do, the third number will tell you how many are in play and how they contribute to the overall soundstage.\nWireless\n\n\n\n\nMost soundbars these days offer either Bluetooth, Wi-Fi or both. When it comes to Wi-Fi, that connectivity affords you luxuries like voice control (either built-in or with a separate device), Chromecast, Spotify Connect and AirPlay 2. Depending on your preferences, you might be able to live without some of these. For me, AirPlay 2 and Chromecast are essentials, but the rest I can live without. Those two give me the ability to beam music and podcasts from my go-to apps without having to settle for — or struggle with — a Bluetooth connection. For instance, Sonos speakers often offer seamless integration with iOS devices, making it easy to connect and stream music wirelessly. If you’re looking for a wireless speaker that can enhance your TV setup while also offering flexibility for audio throughout the house, it's worth considering a multi-room system.\nSize\nThis one might seem obvious but humor me for a minute. Nothing is more soul-crushing than getting a pricey soundbar in your living room only to discover you have to rearrange everything to find a spot for it. This was my plight when the Sennheiser Ambeo Soundbar arrived at my door. Yes, that speaker is absurdly large (and heavy), and most soundbars aren't nearly as big. I learned a valuable lesson: Make sure the space where you want to put a soundbar will accommodate the thing you're about to spend hundreds (if not thousands) of dollars on.\nBasically, it all comes down to the TV you have (or are planning to get) and what the primary goal is for your living-room audio. Is it ease of use? Do you want the best possible sound from a single speaker or speaker/sub combo? Do you just want to be able to actually hear your TV better? Or do you want a full home entertainment experience with crisp vocals, thunderous deep bass, and immersive surround system audio?\nBy paying attention to each of those areas, you should have a good idea of what to look for in a soundbar, soundbar/subwoofer combo, Dolby Digital system or a more robust setup. With that said, we've put numerous products through their paces at Engadget and have a few favorites for best soundbar at various price points to get you started.\nOther soundbars we tested\nSonos Arc\nThere’s no doubt that the Arc is Sonos’ best-sounding soundbar, but it’s also the company’s most expensive. With a new model based on the Arc rumored to be on the way, it’s difficult to recommend this product over the likes of Samsung and Sony. The Arc works well as both a soundbar and a speaker, and the device will fit in nicely with other Sonos gear you might already have for a multiroom setup. It only has one HDMI port though, where much of the competition allows you to connect streaming and gaming devices directly to their soundbars.\nSennheiser Ambeo Soundbar Plus\nI don’t think Sennheiser’s medium-sized model offers enough to stand out from the more powerful Ambeo Soundbar Max or the Ambeo Soundbar Mini. The Mini is more affordable and does a solid job with immersive audio in its own right. Like the rest of the Ambeo lineup, there’s no option for satellite speakers as you can only add a subwoofer to the soundbars. However, the Ambeo Soundbar Plus does have RCA input, so you can use it with a turntable if you’re into vinyl.\nBest soundbar FAQs\nIs a soundbar better than speakers?\nIt really depends on what you’re after. A soundbar is definitely a simpler, more compact solution compared to a full speaker setup. If you want better sound than your TV’s built-in setup but don’t want to deal with multiple speakers and wires everywhere, a soundbar is probably the way to go. Some soundbars can even deliver impressive surround sound effects, thanks to features like Dolby Atmos and virtual audio technology. \nHowever, if you’re an audiophile or want true surround sound for an at-home theater experience, a multi-speaker setup with a receiver, surround speakers and subwoofer will give you a richer soundstage and more control over your experience.\nWhat connection do I need for a soundbar?\nMost modern soundbars connect to your TV via HDMI ARC or eARC, which is the easiest and best option for achieving high-quality audio. If your TV supports this, all you need is an HDMI cable, and you’ll get not only great sound but also some extra features like controlling the soundbar with your TV remote. \nIf HDMI ARC isn’t an option on your TV, you can use an optical cable, which also delivers solid audio quality. Some soundbars even offer Bluetooth or Wi-Fi connections for streaming music, and a few still have a 3.5mm aux jack for connecting to older devices. \nDo all soundbars come with subwoofers?\nNot all soundbars come with subwoofers, but many do or at least offer one as an optional add-on that you can purchase separately. A subwoofer is what gives you that deep, booming bass, so if you like action movies or want a fuller sound for music, having one can make a big difference. Some soundbars have a built-in subwoofer, but these generally don’t provide the same punch as a separate one. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/speakers/best-soundbars-143041791.html?src=rss",

The second contains the video game stories from the past week that you need to know about, including some headlines from outside of Engadget.\nPlease enjoy — and I'll see you next week.\n\nIf I end up reading one more story about how fantastic Death Stranding 2 is so long as you skip the cutscenes, I’m gonna hurl. At what point during 10 hours of cinematic interstitials do we collectively put the controller down and say, actually, this isn’t a great game? Not because the game parts aren’t any good — they’re pretty fabulous, in fact — but because a significant portion of the experience isn’t actually interactive at all. When does it become more accurate to describe a Hideo Kojima project as a CGI movie with moments of interactivity, rather than as a video game first?\nI’m not actually attempting to solve the “video game of Theseus” riddle right now, but it’s a conversation that’s been on my mind, given recent headlines. Death Stranding 2 reviews are in, Neil Druckmann is out at HBO and returning to Naughty Dog full-time, and Emmy nominations arrived with 18 nods for video game adaptations. Meanwhile, layoffs are rocking the gaming industry yet again, with thousands fired at Xbox this month, alongside multiple studio closures and game cancellations. One of the most surprising titles to get the ax was Project Blackbird, a promising-sounding MMO from Elder Scrolls studio ZeniMax Online. Blackbird was reportedly canceled in favor of allocating resources to the development of Fallout 5, a series with mainstream clout following the success of Amazon’s Fallout TV show in 2024.\nThe convergence of video games and Hollywood is not a new talking point — even for me — but it’s only grown more relevant with time. Sony in particular is leaning hard into a cross-media strategy with notable investments in television, anime and film adaptations of its video game franchises, and it just published Kojima Productions’ Death Stranding 2, which serves as a lightning rod for this entire conversation.\nKojima is easy to pick on because he’s been so vocal about his desire to make movies, and fittingly, his games have only grown more cinematic over the years. Death Stranding and its sequel are stacked with mainstream Hollywood actors (and Kojima’s favorite directors) across hours of drawn-out, non-interactive cutscenes. His next two projects, OD and Physint, are both described as having A-list casts and “blurring the boundaries between film and games.”\nI’m a big fan of experimental horror games, and I deeply appreciate Kojima’s eye for building tension and sneaky action sequences, but I’m hesitant to get excited about OD and Physint. The deeper Kojima dives into the world of Hollywood, the more he loses me. I don’t download, install and boot up a video game to watch a movie instead, and I don’t find it impressive when an interactive product is defined by cinematic terms. The constraints of filmmaking are vastly different than those of video game development, and it sucks to watch a talented creator try to force video games to conform to the boundaries of movies or TV, rather than exploring the mechanics that make interactive art so uniquely powerful. I feel like Kojima sees cinema as the goal, not video games specifically, and this perspective breaks my little pixelated heart.\nIt’s particularly painful in an era of raging instability for the video game industry. It’s difficult to see so much money and creative talent being thrown at projects that end up feeling more like movies than games, at a time when it’s increasingly difficult for fresh and original AAA projects to make it to market. Video games have not been maxed out as an art form — there’s far more to discover in terms of mechanics, visuals, haptics and immersive interaction systems, and there are more stories that can only be told with these specific tools. Viewing game development through the lens of filmmaking diminishes everything that makes this medium so powerful. The only Hollywood trait the games industry should imitate is its powerful and functional unions.\nI enjoy things that exist in the gray space between definitions; in fact, I often prefer them. What I don’t enjoy is misguided emulation that’s sold to an audience as innovation. In the end, I guess what I’m really saying is… I’m still not over PT.\n\nThe news\nKing developers were the architects of their own demise\nOne of the most eyebrow-raising details of Microsoft’s sweeping layoffs earlier this month was the fact that King, the studio behind Candy Crush, was included in the firings. King is historically a money-printing machine with high per-employee returns, which tends to insulate it from layoffs, but this time around at least 200 people were let go from the studio. As it turns out, a number of fired developers spent the past few years training AI systems to do their jobs, which just adds a layer of shittiness to an already crappy situation.\nBest Buy will have more Switch 2 units on Thursday\nHas the FOMO gotten to you yet? After denying that you wanted a Switch 2 for a few noble and self-righteous weeks, have you cracked and admitted that you actually, really want one? Great — then get yourself to Best Buy on Thursday, July 17, when the company will restock its supply of Switch 2 consoles in all stores. This coincides with the release of Donkey Kong Banaza, too.\nA small update on Ken Levine’s Judas (sung like Lady Gaga)\nI’ve had my eye on Judas, the BioShocky FPS from Ken Levine’s Ghost Story Games, since it was revealed in 2022, and I lowkey love how little we still know about it today. That said, I’m happily devouring every bit of information about Judas, and the latest nugget comes from Levine himself in an interview with classic game publisher Nightdive Studios. With Judas, Ghost Story is focused on \"telling the story and transporting the player somewhere,\" rather than building live-service or microtransaction features, Levine said. As he put it, “You buy the game and you get the whole thing. There's no online component. There's no live service.”\nThere’s also no release date for Judas yet.\n\nSummer Games Done Quick can’t stop raising millions for charity\nThe crazy kids at Summer Games Done Quick have done it once again and raised literal millions of dollars for Doctors Without Borders in a single weekend, simply by playing video games in silly ways without stopping. SGDQ 2025 wrapped up on Sunday with a total donation pool of $2,436,614. The organization's next event is another edition of Flame Fatales, a speedrunning showcase featuring women and femmes that runs from September 7 to 14. We’ll see you there.\nOusted Subnautica 2 studio bosses are suing Krafton\nThe well of Subnautica 2 drama runs deep. Earlier in July the heads of Subnatica 2 studio Unknown Worlds Entertainment — Charlie Cleveland, Ted Gill and Max McGuire — were ousted by the team’s parent company, Krafton, and the game’s early access release was delayed to 2026. What’s more, Bloomberg reported that the studio had been in line for a $250 million bonus if it had met certain financial goals by the end of the year, but those largely hinged on an early access release. Cleveland said on social media that Subnautica 2 was ready for early access, and Krafton responded to the whole shebang by accusing the fired developers of abandoning their responsibilities as studio heads. Cleveland and others are now apparently filing a lawsuit against Krafton. GamesIndustry.biz has a comprehensive timeline of the Subnautica 2 controversy right here.\nAdditional reading\n\nKris Holt’s weekly indie game roundup\nGhost of Yōtei's lo-fi beats mode sums up the very best and very worst of this very weird series by Chris Tapsell at Eurogamer\n\n\nHave a tip for Jessica?

    "summary": "The nominations for the 77th Emmy Awards just dropped and, unsurprisingly, Apple TV+'s Severance led the pack with a whopping 27, including Best Drama. The streamer has another bona-fide hit with the Seth Rogen-led The Studio, which captured 23 nominations.\nHowever, HBO Max received the most kudos by platform, with 142 nominations in total. This is thanks to the second season of The Last of Us, with 16 nominations, and the Batman-adjacent The Penguin. The White Lotus, The Pitt and Hacks also grabbed multiple nominations. This is the highest number of noms the outlet has ever received. Netflix still holds the record, though, with 160 nominations in 2020.\n\nAndor scored 14 nominations, including one for Best Drama. Star Wars shows aren't typically singled out for the high-profile awards, though the first season of Andor was also up for Best Drama, before losing to Succession. No actors from the series were nominated, which is a bummer given the performances by Diego Luna, Denise Gough, Elizabeth Dulau and Stellan Skarsgård, among others.\nThere was a day when sci-fi programs only received nominations for stuff involving costumes or sets. That sure has changed, with Andor, The Last of Us, Severance, Paradise and Black Mirror receiving so much love this year. Fallout also made an impressive showing last year.\nThe 77th Emmy Awards will be hosted by comedian Nate Bargatze and is airing live on CBS on September 14 at 8PM ET.

The situation appears to have been particularly galling for staff at Candy Crush developer King who are reportedly set to be replaced by AI tools they worked on.\nMultiple anonymous sources have told MobileGamer.biz that a number of narrative, UX, level design and user research staffers at King have spent several years helping to build and train AI models that can do their jobs more quickly.

Engadget’s Jessica Conditt recently spoke to employees at Halo Studios, with one developer telling us they were \"super pissed\" about the layoffs. At least five people within Halo Studios were told they no longer had jobs shortly after receiving an all-staff email from Microsoft Gaming SEO Phil Spencer allegedly celebrating Xbox’s current profitability. The same developer said Microsoft was trying its \"damnest to replace as many jobs as [it] can with AI agents\" as it increasingly pushes Copilot on its staff.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/laid-off-candy-crush-studio-staff-reportedly-replaced-by-the-ai-tools-they-helped-build-174141524.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Xbox has confirmed the second batch of Game Pass additions for July. There's no obvious headliner here, but there are a bunch of great additions to the catalog. These include indie hits like Wheel World and blockbusters like Robocop: Rogue City. Let's get into it.\n\nRobocop: Rogue City came as a huge surprise back in 2023. A game based on a decades-old sci-fi franchise by a relatively unknown developer? It should have been a train wreck. Instead, it's a solid 3D action title that perfectly captures the vibe of the original film. This is a must-play for children of the 1980s. It'll be available on July 17 for subscribers on all tiers.\n\nGrounded 2 looks to be a fantastic take on the \"shrunken teens navigating a yard\" genre, as first pioneered in the film Honey, I Shrunk the Kids. The first game was great and Obsidian looks to be upping the ante here in nearly every way, with a larger focus on story, a more immersive world and insects to ride around on. This is a day one Game Pass release, which happens on July 29. It'll only be playable for PC and Ultimate subscribers.\n\nThe Annapurna-published Wheel World is finally heading our way on July 23, and it's a day one Game Pass release. This is an open-world bicycle sim with gorgeous cel-shaded graphics. The title promises \"impressive vistas, hidden secrets and races that will test your skills.\" It'll be available for Ultimate and PC subscribers.\n\nWuchang: Fallen Feathers is another day one release, with availability on July 24. This is a Souls-like action RPG set in the final days of the Ming Dynasty. The combat looks absolutely brutal. Again, only Ultimate and PC subscribers will have access to the game.\nThose are just the titles that caught my interest. The shooter High On Life returns to the platform today and the survival horror adventure My Friendly Neighborhood drops on July 17. The prison-based RPG Back to the Dawn will be playable on July 18 and the survival crafting title Abiotic Factor releases on July 22. As always, Game Pass remains one heck of a deal.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xboxs-second-batch-of-game-pass-additions-for-july-includes-grounded-2-and-wheel-world-164450594.html?src=rss",

It's a list that now stretches far beyond Tesla's Autopilot and Full-Self-Driving. Rivian, GM, Ford and Nissan each have automated options.\nAs for Lucid, it's been a rocky ride lately, reflecting the industry's broader turbulence. It had two rounds of layoffs, cutting 400 people last year after reducing its workforce by 1,300 in 2023. On the bright side, its Gravity SUV has had a positive reception.

The two companies have also pledged to work together to improve upon a processing facility in Texas, building a series of manufacturing lines specifically designed for Apple products. Once finished, the factory will \"support dozens of new jobs in advanced manufacturing and R&D.\"\n“American innovation drives everything we do at Apple, and we’re proud to deepen our investment in the U.S. economy,” said Apple CEO Tim Cook. “Rare earth materials are essential for making advanced technology, and this partnership will help strengthen the supply of these vital materials here in the United States.\"\nApple and MP will also team up to create a recycling facility in California and have promised to develop \"novel magnet materials and innovative processing technologies\" to enhance magnet performance. \n\nThis is all part of Apple's pre-existing pledge to invest $500 billion in the US over the next four years, which is a slight increase over the $430 billion pledged in 2021.
