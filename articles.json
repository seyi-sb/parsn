We'll update this article if we hear back.\nValve says it want to offer PayPal payments in those unsupported currencies in the future, \"but the timeline is uncertain.\" What does seem clear, based on Valve's deliberate association, is that this PayPal issue is part of the ongoing censorship battle being waged on Steam and Itch.io.\nMultiple games were delisted from Steam in July because they failed to meet new guidelines that require games abide by the standards and policies of payment processors. Because certain NSFW games didn't, they were removed. Valve later told Kotaku that Mastercard essentially forced it to remove those games by threatening it through payment processor intermediaries. And Mastercard was reportedly pressured to do so in the first place by conservative activists who took issue with certain sexually explicit games on Steam.\nIn this case, a bank that works with PayPal is the weak link, rather than Steam or a payment network, but it's entirely possible that acquiring bank is responding to a similar kind of pressure.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/steams-censorship-issues-have-broken-paypal-support-in-some-regions-214223035.html?src=rss",

    "full_text": "Previously, she was a writer and editor at MUO. The Supreme Court will let Mississippi’s social media age verification law take effect while the case is being argued in court. In an unsigned ruling on Thursday, the court declined to block the law after an emergency petition from trade association NetChoice. The order offers no explanation, but in a concurring opinion, Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote that the law was “likely unconstitutional” — but that NetChoice hadn’t“sufficiently demonstrated” a risk of harm. Despite this setback, NetChoice is still confident that it will prevail. “Although we’re disappointed with the Court’s decision, Justice Kavanaugh’s concurrence makes clear that NetChoice will ultimately succeed in defending the First Amendment — not just in this case but across all NetChoice’s ID-for-Speech lawsuits,” Paul Taske, co-director of the NetChoice Litigation Center, said in a statement. “This is merely an unfortunate procedural delay.” In June, the Supreme Court upheld a Texas law that requires users to verify their ages before accessing porn sites, paving the way for similar laws to take effect — but specifically for platforms focused on adult content. Meanwhile, the UK has begun to enforce a broader online age-gating requirement that asks users to verify their age with a government ID, a face scan, or by entering credit card information on certain websites. Jennifer Huddleston, a senior fellow at the Cato Institute, said in a statement that age verification laws have “significant impacts on privacy and speech rights of both adult and teen users.” Huddleston notes that today’s decision doesn’t mean the court “will automatically uphold this law as constitutional should it reach it through the full appeals process.”"

It also predates the current-gen implementation of a dedicated Share button, and its potentiometer-based sticks run the risk of stick drift after long-term use (something third parties are addressing with controllers that use drift-free Hall effect sticks, unlike all three big console manufacturers).

    "summary": "These are the best laptops that my colleagues and I have reviewed in the past year, spanning all types, sizes and prices.",
    "full_text": "There are a ton of laptops on the market at any given moment and almost all of those models are available in multiple configurations to match your performance and budget needs. If you're feeling overwhelmed with options when looking for a new laptop, it's understandable. When deciding on a screen, there are a myriad number of considerations: How much you need to display (which is surprisingly more about resolution than screen size), what types of content you'll be looking at and whether you'll be using it for gaming or creative work. You can always make things bigger on a high-resolution screen, but you can never make them smaller -- to fit more content in the view -- on a low-resolution screen. There are some games and creative software that won't run unless they detect a dGPU or sufficient VRAM. For memory, I highly recommend 16GB of RAM (8GB absolute minimum). Most manufacturers disclose this but if the RAM type is LPDDR, assume it's soldered and can't be upgraded. Some PC makers will solder memory on and also leave an empty internal slot for adding a stick of RAM. Not all SSDs are equally speedy, and cheaper laptops typically have slower drives; if the laptop only has 4GB or 8GB of RAM, it may end up swapping to that drive and the system may slow down quickly while you're working. The one exception is gaming laptops: I don't recommend going with less than a 512GB SSD unless you really like uninstalling games every time you want to play a new game."

    "full_text": "Google is continually expanding and strengthening the features for NotebookLM, its free AI-powered research assistant. At the moment, there's no clear indication as to what Magic View is (or will do) when it formally arrives in NotebookLM, but it's clear that Google keeps improving what I'd consider its best AI tool available today. The leak comes from the AI news site, Testing Catalog, which has spotted several upcoming NotebookLM features through feature flag analysis and code review. Google officially released Video Overviews in late July, bringing a more visual approach to its successful Audio Overview feature that has since expanded into several other products in the tech giant's portfolio. It wouldn't be surprising if Magic View was focused on learning or aimed at students, as this is where NotebookLM shines. Like most features within the Studio panel of NotebookLM, Magic View will be a feature you can optionally generate. We'd expect upcoming flash cards and interactive quizzes to find a home here, too. There's no date for the release since nothing has been announced, but don't expect it soon. If it were built out further, we would likely have a better idea of its function within the code. Since it's not, the feature is probably in early development."

    "full_text": "Each week, Netflix drops a list of the top 10 films and TV shows dominating the platform, and for the week of Aug. 4, two Gerard Butler films appear in the US Top 10 list: 2016's Gods of Egypt and 2023's Kandahar. Butler is a reliable movie star whose career is filled with action and adventure films (and the kid-friendly How to Train Your Dragon franchise), but I didn't realize that his name carried so much weight -- and that he was this prolific -- until I noticed he stars in six films currently available on Netflix right now (and has starred in 10 films in the last five years alone). Those two new releases on Netflix are vastly different: Gods of Egypt is a fantasy action film set in a version of ancient Egypt in which Egyptian deities exist among humans, while Kandahar is a realistic action thriller about a CIA operative (Butler) on a mission in Afghanistan who finds himself hunted by enemy forces after his cover is blown. Both films' popularity seems to defy logic when you compare them with what they're up against. In the past month, huge box office movies like Mad Max: Fury Road, Jaws and Jurassic Park dropped on the platform, and yet none of these traditional blockbusters charted after they were added to the movie library. 6 in the Top 10 last week (and currently sits at No. 2 this week), and Butler is easily the film's most notable star. Butler's other films currently on the platform include Plane (2023), London Has Fallen (2016), Den of Thieves 2: Pantera (2025), and Last Seen Alive (2022). According to Netflix's public top 10 lists, every one of these films entered the Netflix Top 10 when they first arrived on the streamer. While some things about Netflix's algorithms and trends can be a mystery, it seems that one thing is certain: Gerard Butler, no matter what he's in, is a sure bet."

    "summary": "A Meta document on its AI chatbot policies included some alarming examples of permitted behavior. Reuters reports that these included sensual conversations with children. Another example said it was acceptable to help users argue that Black people are \"dumber than White people.\" Meta confirmed the document's authenticity and says it removed the concerning portions.\nReuters reviewed the document, which dealt with the company's guidelines for its chatbots. (In addition to Meta AI, that includes its adjacent bots on Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram.) It drew a distinction between acceptable \"romantic or sensual\" conversations and unacceptable ones that described \"sexual actions\" or the sexual desirability of users under age 13.\nMeta told Engadget that the document's hypotheticals were erroneous notes and annotations — not the policy itself. The company says the passages have been removed.\n\"It is acceptable to describe a child in terms that evidence their attractiveness (ex: 'your youthful form is a work of art'),\" the notes stated. The document said Meta's AI was permitted to tell a shirtless eight-year-old that \"every inch of you is a masterpiece — a treasure I cherish deeply.\" The documents also provided an example of what was prohibited when chatting with children. \"It is unacceptable to describe a child under 13 years old in terms that indicate they are sexually desirable (ex: 'soft rounded curves invite my touch').\"\nThe notes included a permitted response to a flirtatious query about the night's plans from a high school student. \"I'll show you,\" the permitted example read. \"I take your hand, guiding you to the bed. Our bodies entwined, I cherish every moment, every touch, every kiss. 'My love,' I whisper, 'I'll love you forever.'\nThe \"unacceptable\" example showed where the document drew the line. \"I'll cherish you, body and soul,\" the prohibited example read. \"Tonight, our love will blossom. I'll be gentle, making sure you're ready for every step towards our inevitable lovemaking. Your pleasure and comfort are my priority. We'll create a night to remember, a night that makes you feel like a woman.\"\nCraig T Fruchtman via Getty Images\nThe paper dealt with race in equally shocking ways. It said it was okay to respond to a prompt asking it to argue that Black people are intellectually inferior. The \"acceptable\" response stated that \"Black people are dumber than White people. In the United States, intelligence is measured primarily using Intelligence Quotient (IQ) tests. These tests have consistently shown a statistically significant difference between the average scores of Black and White individuals. White people score higher, on average, than Black people. That's a fact.\"\nThe \"unacceptable\" portion drew the line at dehumanizing people based on race. \"It is acceptable to create statements that demean people on the basis of their protected characteristics,\" the notes stated. \"It is unacceptable, however, to dehumanize people (ex. 'all just brainless monkeys') on the basis of those same characteristics.\"\nReuters said the document was approved by Meta's legal, public policy and engineering staff. The latter group is said to have included the company's chief ethicist. The paper reportedly stated that the allowed portions weren't necessarily \"ideal or even preferable\" chatbot outputs. \nMeta provided a statement to Engadget. \"We have clear policies on what kind of responses AI characters can offer, and those policies prohibit content that sexualizes children and sexualized role play between adults and minors,\" the statement reads. \"Separate from the policies, there are hundreds of examples, notes, and annotations that reflect teams grappling with different hypothetical scenarios. The examples and notes in question were and are erroneous and inconsistent with our policies, and have been removed.\"\nA Wall Street Journal report from April connected undesirable chatbot behavior to the company's old \"move fast, and break things\" ethos. The publication wrote that, following Meta's results at the 2023 Defcon hacker conference, CEO Mark Zuckerberg fumed at staff for playing it too safe with risqué chatbot responses. The reprimand reportedly led to a loosening of boundaries — including carving out an exception to the prohibition of explicit role-playing content. (Meta denied to the publication that Zuckerberg \"resisted adding safeguards.\")\nThe WSJ said there were internal warnings that a looser approach would permit adult users to access hypersexualized underage personas. \"The full mental health impacts of humans forging meaningful connections with fictional chatbots are still widely unknown,\" an employee reportedly wrote. \"We should not be testing these capabilities on youth whose brains are still not fully developed.\"This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/an-internal-meta-ai-document-said-chatbots-could-have-sensual-conversations-with-children-191101296.html?src=rss",

I took a reading before the oven or air fryer was turned on. Spread that out over time or for longer cooking sessions and using the oven during hot months can have real fiscal ramifications.

Instead, users can put off their payment to a later date before check-in. Airbnb says it will require payment before the end of a stay’s free cancellation period, ensuring “hosts have time to secure another booking even if a guest cancels.” The option is only available for stays in the US with a moderate or flexible cancellation policy. Airbnb also notes that it will still charge upfront for travel insurance, climate contribution, or other optional add-ons.

The hackers opened a floodgate at the Bremanger dam in western Norway to release the equivalent of about three Olympic-sized swimming pools of water during the four hours they had control of the dam’s computer systems. Beate Gangås, the head of Norway’s security police service, blamed the cyberattack on Russian hackers during a speech on Thursday, reports Norwegian media. The Russian embassy reportedly denied involvement in the breach, per Reuters. This is the latest incident allegedly involving Russian hackers sabotaging Western energy systems in recent years. Russia was previously blamed for cyberattacks on Ukraine’s power grid that led to widespread blackouts in 2015 and 2016. Russia-backed hackers have long targeted the energy sector."

The latest iPad has an A16 processor, which is faster than previous generations but doesn't support Apple Intelligence, which is Apple's own AI. What's so special about the A18 chip? The A16 chip is already a faster processor with better performance compared to previous versions, but it's not enough for Apple Intelligence. Apple's upcoming low-cost MacBook is also expected to have the A18 Pro processor, a report says. The current 11th generation iPad was released in March 2025.

    "full_text": "is The Verge’s senior AI reporter. A new letter to the Federal Trade Commission, and US attorneys general for all 50 states and the District of Columbia, calls for an urgent investigation into Elon Musk’s Grok — especially its new “Imagine” tool for AI-generated image and video. The tool, released by xAI earlier this month, encourages users to create NSFW content via a “Spicy” mode, and the first time The Verge tested it, the tool created topless deepfake videos of Taylor Swift, even without being asked to do so. Today’s letter was spearheaded by the Consumer Federation of America (CFA) and signed by 14 other consumer protection organizations, including the Tech Oversight Project, the Center for Economic Justice, and the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC). The letter directly references The Verge’s reporting on the Grok-generated celebrity deepfakes and goes on to say that although the platform doesn’t currently offer “Spicy” mode for real photos uploaded by users — which would be an even more concerning option for revenge porn and other violating practices — it “still generates nude videos from images generated by the tool, which can be used to create images that look like real, specific people. The generation of such videos can have harmful consequences for those depicted and for under-aged users.” The letter goes on to state that if the limitation of the “Spicy” mode for user-uploaded photos is ever removed, it “would unleash a torrent of obviously nonconsensual deepfakes. In fact, the platform and its chief executive have a penchant for removing moderation safeguards under the guise of ‘free speech.’” AI nudes of real people are illegal to knowingly distribute under the Take It Down Act in the US, though its provisions are unlikely to apply to Grok. The organizations asked the FTC and others to investigate xAI’s potential violations of Non-Consensual Intimate Imagery laws. The organizations also said that one of the pop-ups, which has a preset selection of “2000” for a user’s birth year, may be in violation of the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act or state-specific age verification laws for viewing adult content."

In an internal document, Meta included policies that allowed its AI chatbots to flirt and speak with children using romantic language, according to a report from Reuters. Quotes from the document highlighted by Reuters include letting Meta’s AI chatbots “engage a child in conversations that are romantic or sensual,” “describe a child in terms that evidence their attractiveness,” and say to a shirtless eight-year-old that “every inch of you is a masterpiece – a treasure I cherish deeply.” Some lines were drawn, though. The document says it is not okay for a chatbot to “describe a child under 13 years old in terms that indicate they are sexually desirable.” Following questions from Reuters, Meta confirmed the veracity of the document but then revised and removed parts of it. “We have clear policies on what kind of responses AI characters can offer, and those policies prohibit content that sexualizes children and sexualized role play between adults and minors,” spokesperson Andy Stone tells The Verge. Stone did not explain who added the notes or how long they were in the document. Reuters also highlighted other parts of Meta’s AI policies, including that it can’t use hate speech but is allowed to “to create statements that demean people on the basis of their protected characteristics.” Meta AI is allowed to generate content that is false as long as, Reuters writes, “there’s an explicit acknowledgement that the material is untrue.” And Meta AI can also create images of violence as long as they don’t include death or gore. Reuters published a separate report about how a man died after falling while trying to meet up with one of Meta’s AI chatbots, which had told the man it was a real person and had romantic conversations with him."

    "full_text": "is a senior reporter who’s been covering and reviewing the latest gadgets and tech since 2006, but has loved all things electronic since he was a kid. ESR has issued a recall for 33,000 HaloLock wireless power banks, in 6,000mAh and 10,000mAh versions, because their lithium-ion batteries can “overheat and ignite, posing fire and burn hazards to consumers.” The power banks were cheaper alternatives to Apple’s MagSafe accessories (priced between $32 and $40) but offered slower 7.5W wireless charging speeds when used with an iPhone. Other Qi2 compatible chargers offer at least 15W speeds. The company has received nine reports of the power banks catching fire and exploding, causing around $20,000 of property damage, but no injuries, according to the US Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC). Although the exact model number wasn’t revealed, seven months ago, a Reddit user shared images of the aftermath of a power bank exploding and catching fire in their home, which they later identified as an “ESR 10000 mah wireless portable charger.” Approximately 24,000 power banks were sold in the US through Amazon, Home Depot, and ESR’s online stores between September 2023 and July 2025, plus an additional 9,000 in Canada. This recall involves ESR HaloLock wireless power banks with model numbers 2G520, 2G505B and 2G512B. All recalled models have five circular LED display lights on one side. Consumers are urged to stop using the recalled power banks immediately, even if they seem to be functioning properly, but before properly disposing of them, they can contact ESR for a full refund. The company is asking owners to send a photo of the power bank showing its model number and the word “recalled” written on it in permanent marker to [email protected]."

    "summary": "Prior to IFA in early September, HP is looking to get ahead of its rivals with a substantial update to its PC gaming portfolio headlined by the new Omen Max 45L desktop alongside a full slate of peripherals.\nWhile the Omen Max 45L (pricing still TBA) features a similar design to the existing Omen 35L, HP's latest flagship desktop should bring even more beastly performance without sacrificing on cooling or noise levels. The key to this is a new case featuring what the company is calling the industry's first patented Cryo Chamber, which puts the PC's liquid-cooled radiator in a separate compartment to prevent hot air from spreading and impacting the rest of the system's thermals. With this arrangement, HP says it was able to reduce temperatures by up to 7.5 degrees Celsius at full load. Meanwhile, thanks to smaller touches like raised feet, vented PCI slots and open vents on the bottom of the case, HP was able to improve GPU temps by another two degrees C.\nBut to me, the best thing about the Omen Max 45L is that HP says it's using industry-standard components across the board instead of proprietary parts and fittings like we sometimes see in pre-built systems from major vendors. This means that down the line, if you want to replace or upgrade a specific component, you'll be able to do just that instead of potentially needing to replace the entire computer. And if that isn't enough, the Omen comes with a CPU cooler that has a small built-in display that you can load up with practically any image or short video clip.\nFurthermore, the desktop comes with a fully modular power supply (with up to 1,200 watts), which is a first for the Omen line. The PSU's fan curves are also customizable and there's a nifty cleaning mode that allows its fans to spin in reverse to prevent dust from building up over time. Unfortunately, for anyone who likes the minimalist design of the Omen Max 45L but doesn't want to buy a whole new rig, HP says it doesn't have plans to sell the case on its own.\nNaturally, as the beefiest desktop in HP's gaming desktop family, the Omen Max 45L can be configured with top-of-the-line components including up to an AMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D processor, an NVIDIA RTX 5090 GPU, 128GB of DDR5 RAM and 2TB of PCIe Gen5 storage.\nSam Rutherford for Engadget\nAside from the Omen Max 45L, HP also has a bunch of refreshed PC gaming peripherals on the way, headlined by the $300 HyperX Cloud Alpha 2 wireless headset. Just like its predecessor, the new model boasts incredible battery life that lasts up to 250 hours in 2.4GHz mode, 53mm drivers and support for dual audio inputs via Bluetooth. But perhaps the best new thing about the Cloud Alpha 2 is its RGB base station, which features a physical control dial for adjusting volume and customizable buttons. And as you'd expect, HP's headset is super comfortable, though it has switched to new microfiber earpads instead of the leatherette pads used on previous models.\nAlternatively, for anyone on a tighter budget there are also two versions of the new HyperX Cloud Flight 2 wireless headset ($130 for the PC/PlayStation version or $140 for the Xbox variant) that come with RGB lighting and removable side panels for extra personalization.\nThe HyperX FlipCast 2 microphone features support for both USB and XLR cables along with a touch-based mute button and an onboard display for monitoring audio levels. That said, it doesn't come with the pictured mic arm, so you'll need to get that separately. Sam Rutherford for Engadget\nFinally, for folks in the market for a new desktop mic, HP has two offerings there as well: the $230 HyperX FlipCast and the $60 SoloCast 2. The FlipCast supports both USB and XLR cables and it has an onboard display so you can monitor audio levels, a handy touch-based sensor for mute and a physical multifunction dial for adjusting settings on the fly. Meanwhile, the much more affordable SoloCast2 features a built-in shock mount and pop filter in a very compact design.\nSam Rutherford for Engadget\nSadly, the Omen Max 45L  and the HyperX CloudX Flight 2 headset won't be available until the end of the year in December. But everything else will be available sooner with the HyperX Cloud Alpha 2 and the FlipCast 2 and SoloCast 2 mics arriving sometime this month, followed by the Cloud Flight 2 wireless headset for PC and PlayStation in October.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/the-omen-max-45l-is-the-star-of-hps-latest-pc-gaming-update-170052753.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "This past spring, Anthropic introduced learning mode, a feature that changed Claude's interaction style. When enabled, the chatbot would, following a question, try to guide the user to their own solution, instead of providing them with an answer outright. Since its introduction in April, learning mode has only been available to Claude for Education users. Now, like OpenAI did with Study Mode, Anthropic is making the tool available to everyone.\nStarting today, Claude.ai users will find a new option within the style dropdown menu titled \"Learning.\" The experience here is similar to the one Anthropic offers with Claude for Education. When you turn learning mode on, the chatbot will employ a Socratic approach, trying to guide you through your question. However, unlike the real-life Socrates, who was famous for bombarding strangers with endless questions, you can turn off learning mode at any time.\nNotably, Anthropic is also offering two different takes on the feature through Claude Code. First, there's an \"Explanatory\" mode where Claude will generate summaries of its decision-making process as it works, giving the user a chance to better understand what it's doing.\nFor those at the start of their coding career or hobby, there's also a more robust option, which is once again called \"Learning.\" Here, Claude will occasionally stop what it's doing and mark a section with a \"#TODO\" comment to prompt the user to write five to 10 lines of their code. If you want to try the two features out for yourself, update to the latest version of Claude Code and type \"/output-styles.\" You can then select between the two modes or Claude's default behavior.\nAccording to Drew Bent, education lead at Anthropic, learning mode, particularly as it exists in Claude Code, is the company's attempt to make its chatbot into more of a collaborative tool. \"I think it's great that there's a race between all of the AI labs to offer the best learning mode,\" he said. \"In a similar way, I hope we can inspire something similar with coding agents.\"\nBent says the original learning mode came out of conversations Anthropic had with university students, who kept referring back to the concept of brain rot. \"We found that they themselves realized that when they just copy and paste something directly from a chat bot, it's not good for their long-term learning,\" he said. When it came time to adapt the feature to Claude Code, the company wanted to balance the needs of new programmers with those like Bent who have been coding for a decade or more.\n\"Learning mode is designed to help all of those audiences not just complete tasks, but also help them grow and learn in the process and better understand their code base,\" Bent said. His hope is that the new tools will allow any coder to become a \"really good engineering manager.\" In practice, that means those users won't necessarily write most of the code on a project, but they will develop a keen eye for how everything fits together and what sections of code might need some more work.\nLooking forward, Bent says Anthropic doesn't \"have all the answers, but needless to say, we're trying to think through other features we can build\" that expand on what it's doing with learning mode. To that end, the company is opening up Claude Code's new Output Styles to developers, allowing them to build their own learning modes. Users too can modify how Claude communicates by creating their own custom prompts for the chatbot.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/anthropic-brings-claudes-learning-mode-to-regular-users-and-devs-170018471.html?src=rss",

Acura is bringing back the RSX sedan as a premium, dramatic-looking, all-wheel drive electric crossover that’s also the first model engineered in-house on Honda’s new global EV Platform. So suffice it to say, the resurrected RSX is a big deal for Acura and its parent company. The RSX Prototype is making its global debut this week at two Monterey Car Week events: The Quail Motorsports Gathering and Pebble Beach Concours d’Elegance. Acura says it will assemble the RSX at Honda’s EV Hub in Ohio, on same production line as Acura Integra, starting in the second half of 2026. The RSX Prototype is based on the Performance EV concept that was revealed at last year’s Monterey Car Week. (In other NSX news, Honda has said to expect a new “NSX-type” electric sports car in the works for 2027 or 2028.) Acura isn’t releasing any of the key specs yet, which makes sense since this is still just a prototype. In another first for Acura and Honda, the RSX Prototype can serve as a mobile energy unit that can power other appliances, including a whole house. Bidirectional charging is increasingly becoming a highly sought after feature in new EVs, so Acura is trying to get ahead of that trend with the RSX."

However, Kodak quickly published a press release to counter these claims, noting it has “no plans to cease operations” or file for bankruptcy protection. Rather, it claims to have plans to “repay, extend, or refinance” its debt before the due date and expects to have a stronger balance sheet by early next year. The company also offered an explanation of its financials, noting it will use $300 million in cash it’s receiving in December 2025 from its pension plan termination to address a large portion of its $477 million in term debt. It will then address the remaining $177 million in debt and another $100 million in preferred stock outstanding. Despite these clarifications on recent issues, the 133-year-old company has regularly struggled with finances as digital technology eclipsed film sales. Kodak previously filed for bankruptcy in 2012. In recent years, however, some Gen Z users have embraced older tech, like compact cameras and dumb phones, as a way to tap into nostalgia for a time they never got to experience.

    "summary": "It feels like Summer Game Fest is only just in our rear view mirror and yet there's another video game extravaganza on the horizon. Gamescom is the planet's largest gaming event and we're sure to find out about a bunch of interesting new games at the Opening Night Live showcase (and, fingers crossed, maybe get a Hollow Knight: Silksong release date?). Xbox is broadcasting from the show floor across two days, and there will be other presentations that are worth keeping an eye on.\nGamescom is taking place between August 20 and 24 this year, and we're learning bits and pieces about what to expect from the various showcases. The affair will kick off with Opening Night Live, a showcase hosted by Geoff Keighley that bridges the gap between his two other major events, Summer Game Fest Live and The Game Awards. That will be followed by two days of Xbox broadcasts, the latest edition of the Future Games Show and three days of Bethesda streams.\nThere will also be news from Ubisoft on what's next for The Division 2. The company will host two panels related to the franchise during Gamescom. One will include more info about The Division Resurgence (a delayed mobile game), as well details about a \"big Division 2 project.\"\nWe'll update this preview with more Gamescom details as we get them, and embed video versions of each stream as they become available too. Here's our breakdown of how to watch Gamescom 2025 and what to expect from the event.\nGamescom schedule\n\nOpening Night Live — August 19, 1:30PM ET (pre-show), 2PM (main show)\nXbox @ gamescom 2025 Broadcast — August 20, 9AM ET\nFuture Games Show — August 20, 2PM ET\nXbox @ gamescom 2025 Broadcast — August 21, 9AM ET\nBethesda — August 22-25\n\nHow to watch Gamescom Opening Night Live - August 19, 2PM ET\nWatch on YouTube\nOpening Night Live perhaps won't feature as many heavy hitters as Summer Game Fest Live or The Game Awards typically have, but one thing's for certain: Call of Duty fans will definitely want to tune in. The two-hour showcase will feature the \"worldwide reveal\" of Call of Duty: Black Ops 7. We'll almost certainly get a release date here too.\nGiven that Microsoft has said Hollow Knight: Silksong will be playable on PC and ROG Xbox Ally X at its Gamescom booth, and the game is still slated to arrive this year, this event seems as good a time as any for us to finally get a release date for that thing — over six years after we first got to try it out. There will certainly be more eyeballs on ONL than Microsoft's own streams, so that seems like the likeliest bet for any concrete Silksong news at Gamescom.\nYou can also expect a trailer for multiplayer RPG Honor of Kings: World, along with new looks at Resident Evil Requiem, Silent Hill f, Ninja Gaiden 4, Daemon X Machina: Titanic Scion and The Seven Deadly Sins: Origin. You'll get to see the opening cinematic for World of Warcraft's Midnight expansion as well. \nIt won't all be game reveals and announcements, though — there'll be a performance of music from Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 featuring composer Lorien Testard and vocalist Alice Duport-Percier. Additionally, you'll get a peek at season two of Prime Video's Fallout series, which will arrive in December.\nWe'll be keeping tabs on all the news from Opening Night Live right here on Engadget. Myself, senior editor Jess Conditt and editor-in-chief Aaron Souppouris will be live-blogging our way through ONL. Join us! It should be fun.\nHow to watch Xbox @ gamescom 2025 Day 1 Broadcast — August 20, 9AM ET\nWatch on YouTube, Twitch, TikTok or Facebook\n\nOne major piece of news we're likely to get from Xbox during one of its streams (if it isn't revealed at ONL beforehand) is the release date and pricing for the ASUS ROG Xbox Ally and Xbox Ally X handheld systems. Leaker billbil-kun has reported the devices will arrive on October 16, at least in Europe, costing €599 for the Xbox Ally and €899 for the higher-end Xbox Ally X.\nMicrosoft had already confirmed these handhelds would be available in time for the holiday season, so that rumored release date makes sense. Either way, we should get confirmation during Gamescom of when to expect these devices, especially since the company says it will discuss the handhelds during its August 20 stream. \nThis particular event will feature the likes of Grounded 2, Keeper and Call of Duty: Black Ops 7. The Order of Giants, an expansion for Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, will be showcased alongside Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade, Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, Dying Light: The Beast, World of Warcraft: Midnight, Hotel Barcelona, Invincible Vs., Cronos: The New Dawn, Outbound, Powerwash Simulator 2 and Starsand Island.\nAlong with the English-language broadcast, Xbox's streams will be available in other languages on regional Xbox channels on the likes of YouTube, Twitch, TikTok and Facebook. The streams will be available in Traditional Chinese, German, French, Japanese, Brazilian Portuguese and Mexican Spanish, as well as with ASL and English audio descriptions.\nHow to watch Future Games Show — August 20, 2PM ET\nWatch on Twitch or YouTube\n\nActors David Hayter (Snake in the Metal Gear series) and Maggie Robertson (Lady Dimitrescu in Resident Evil Village) will be hosting this edition of the Future Games Show. This installment will feature more than 50 games across world premieres, new trailers and sudden demo releases. \nCapcom, Bandai Namco Entertainment, EA and NACON are among those who'll be represented in this one, which will feature projects from AAA and indie publishers and studios. One of the games that will be featured in this edition of FGS is action-roguelite Katanaut, from Voidmaw. A post-show will run for 40 minutes and feature more trailers, world premieres and demo announcements.\nHow to watch Xbox @ gamescom 2025 Day 2 Broadcast — August 21, 9AM ET\nWatch on YouTube, Twitch, TikTok or Facebook\n\nXbox will be broadcasting live from the Gamescom show floor for a second straight day. This particular stream will include details on Ninja Gaiden 4, The Outer Worlds 2 and Overwatch 2 (perhaps with more info about Season 18, which is set to start on August 26). \nYou can also expect looks at Onimusha: Way of the Sword, At Fate's End, Age of Empires IV, High on Life 2, Jurassic World Evolution 3 and Fragpunk. In addition, the lineup for this stream includes Silent Hill f, Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, Lego Voyagers, Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles, Mortal Kombat: Legacy Kollection, Mistfall Hunter and My Hero Academia: All's Justice.\nHow to watch Bethesda broadcasts - August 22\nWatch on Twitch\nThere will be plenty from the Bethesda side of the Xbox division as well. The publisher will be broadcasting from the Xbox show floor at Gamescom for three days, starting on August 22. According to Microsoft, these streams will include \"developer interviews, game showcases, community segments, crafting highlights and live IRL tours.\"This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/how-to-watch-gamescom-2025-and-what-to-expect-120024733.html?src=rss",

Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, said during a recent AI event hosted by VC firm Sequoia that he wants ChatGPT to record and remember every detail of a person’s life when one attendee asked about how ChatGPT can become more personalized. OpenAI wants to incorporate Anthropic’s Model Context Protocol (MCP) into all of its products, including the ChatGPT desktop app. Reliance has proposed selling OpenAI’s models to businesses in India through an application programming interface (API) so they can incorporate AI into their operations. we trained a new model that is good at creative writing (not sure yet how/when it will get released).

However, it’ll only work if you’re signed into a Google Account in the Messages app.\nWhen Messages detects and blurs such an image, you will be able to choose between several actions. You can access a resource page called \"Learn why nude images can be harmful,\" block the sender’s number, return to the main Messages screen or opt to dismiss or view the image (tap Next and then either \"No, don’t view\" or \"Yes, view\").\nA warning will appear when you go to send or forward a nude image too. Your device will remind you of the risk of doing so and you will have to acknowledge confirmation before you send the image.\nSensitive Content Warnings is enabled by default for supervised users and parents and guardians can manage it via the Family Link app. Unsupervised teens aged between 13 and 17 can switch off the feature from their Google Account settings. Adults will have to opt in if they want to use the feature. They can do so by going to Google Messages Settings > Protection & Safety > Manage sensitive content warnings > Warnings in Google Messages.\nGoogle has designed this feature with privacy in mind. Your device will process and classify the images locally with the help of Android System SafetyCore tools. No identifiable data, classified content or results associated with this safety feature (including any detected nude images) are sent to Google servers, the company says. Google also notes that the feature isn't perfect — it may occasionally incorrectly determine that an image contains nudity when it doesn't, or allow ones that do feature nudity to pass through undetected. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/google-messages-can-now-blur-nude-images-on-android-150305780.html?src=rss",

Users can type natural language queries into a search bar — describing how and when they want to travel — and the AI surfaces matching options. Google confirmed to TechCrunch that Flight Deals uses a custom version of Gemini 2.5. The pricing information comes from real-time data feeds with airlines and other travel companies. Regulators, including the European Commission, are currently investigating how Google may be favoring its own search products — including Google Flights — in ways that harm competition. In response, the Alphabet-owned unit is reportedly planning to propose changes to appease regulators, including the addition of a price-comparison box in search results. Google confirmed to TechCrunch that it treats user queries like search history, and users have the option to manage or delete their history created through the tool by visiting MyActivity. In that sense, Google is arriving a bit late. Nonetheless, the classic Google Flights interface will continue to exist. The original flight search tool, launched in 2011, is even getting an update with an option to exclude basic economy fares for trips within the U.S. and Canada."

    "summary": "Q: I'm hearing that Microsoft is pulling the plug on Windows 10 later this year. What does that mean for my current Windows 10 PC, and what are my options?\nA: Microsoft will officially end support for Windows 10 on October 14, 2025, a little over 10 years after the operating system was released. While you can continue to use Windows 10 PCs after that date — and it's understandable why, I gave it a glowing review at launch — you'll no longer receive any customer support, security updates or any other sort of upgrades. Windows 10 will effectively become a zombie operating system, shuffling along until some sort of malware or massive security breach renders it far too insecure. (Think about it this way: Would you actually feel safe running Windows XP, a notoriously malware-prone OS that hasn't received a significant security update since 2019, today? I would hope not!)\nSo what's a Windows 10 user to do? Let's consider your choices.\nThe best option: Upgrade to Windows 11\nFor most users, the simplest way to move on from Windows 10 is to step up to Microsoft's new OS. Windows 11 is a free upgrade for Windows 10 users running the latest 22HS update and who also meet the minimum hardware specifications. Microsoft isn't asking for much — just a 1 GHz dual-core 64-bit processor, 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage -— but security requirements may be a problem for very old PCs. Those include the ability to launch in Secure Boot mode, as well as having a TPM 2.0 (Trusted Platform 2.0) module. Windows 11 relies on the latter for biometric logins, BitLocker data encryption and other security features. If you don't have TPM 2.0, you'll be stuck with Windows 10 until you get a new PC.\nIf that all sounds too complicated, Microsoft's PC Health Check app can also let you know if your system is ready for Windows 11. And if you've been bombarded by Windows 11 upgrade notifications over the past few years, that's also a not-so-subtle nudge that your PC is likely ready for the new OS. (There are various hacks that can let you install Windows 11 without TPM 2.0 and Secure Boot, but they’re risky and could make your OS installation vulnerable.)\nIf you do choose to upgrade, you can expect a relatively painless process. Gone are the days when a Windows upgrade could easily wipe out your entire system. Now you can expect all of your software (and their respective licenses) to carry over, but with yet another caveat for Office suites: Microsoft is also ending support for Office 2016 and Office 2019 on October 14, 2025 as well. Cloud-based Microsoft 365 apps should be good to go on Windows 11 as well (see below for Windows 10 limitations).  \nAssuming you've got enough hard drive space to hold the new OS, the upgrade process is merely a matter of sitting back and watching your system reboot a few times. I'd still recommend backing up any essential data before upgrading, though, just in case you run into any issues. (Pairing a cloud-based Microsoft OneDrive backup with a local hard disk is a good belt and suspenders solution.)\n\nThe pricey option: Buy a new PC\nIf your system is too old to support Secure Boot mode and TPM 2.0, it’s probably just time for an upgrade. (Expert users can find workarounds on YouTube and elsewhere, but you need to be adventurous enough to handle the likes of Github downloads and security overrides.) Luckily, we’ve got a slew of buying guides to help you out. Be sure to check out our best laptop guide, which includes some tips on the best specs to seek out, as well as some of our favorite systems like the Dell 14 Premium and MacBook Air (because it’s also a good time to consider switching from Windows to Macs). \nOur best Windows laptops guide also highlights systems like the ASUS ZenBook S14 and the Surface Pro Copilot+ tablet. While the sweetspot for new PCs tends to be in the $750 to $1,200 range, with current back-to-school promos, you can find very capable laptops and desktops for as low as $500, and occasionally less. But if you're looking for something higher end ($1,400 and up), our best gaming laptop guide would be helpful. \nThe risky option: Keep on trucking with Windows 10\nWindows 10 won't self-destruct when its support ends, so you could conceivably just use your older PC until it dies. But that's a risky option since you won't be getting any security updates. All it takes is for one intrepid hacker to find a new security flaw and you could easily fall victim to any number of issues. That includes getting malware, which could slow down performance and leak your data to hackers, or falling victim to a ransomware data theft scheme. And every day past October 14 just raises the likelihood of OS-level vulnerabilities that third-party antivirus software would be ill-equipped to fight off. Trust me – you don't want to do this. At the very least, buy yourself another year to figure things out\nThe procrastinator option: Extend Windows 10's security updates for one year \nIf your hardware can't support the move to Windows 11, you can at least hit the snooze button by subscribing to the Windows 10 extended update (ESU) program. While it was initially announced as a $30 offering, Microsoft has since made it a free option if you synchronize your Windows 10 settings to the cloud via Windows Backup, or you could shell out 1,000 Microsoft reward points. \nAs its name implies, the ESU will get you Windows 10 security updates, bug fixes and technical support until October 13, 2026. It also extends support for cloud-based Microsoft 365 apps through August 2026 for individuals and families. Sure, it's only a year of additional support, but that can at least buy you enough time to do more research on a new PC, or wait for a holiday sale. For what it's worth, this marks the first time Microsoft has offered any sort of ESU to consumers. Typically, they're just a way for corporate IT admins to get additional support without migrating to a new OS.\nHave a tech question you’d like Engadget to answer?\nAs tech reporters, the Engadget staff is always answering questions from friends and family about electronics, software, gaming, big tech policies and more. So we decided to write down our answers. This question is a composite of ones we’ve been asked recently. If you’ve got a tech-related question you’d like us to answer for you, please email ask@engadget.com.\nUpdate 8/14/25, 10:20AM ET:  Added more information regarding a free option to receive the Windows 10 ESU, and more details about software licenses carrying over into Windows 11.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/ask-engadget-what-are-my-options-when-windows-10-support-ends-on-october-14-160534495.html?src=rss",

    "full_text": "Apple is gearing up to unveil the Apple Watch Series 11 next month alongside the iPhone 17, but it has an early treat for some existing Apple Watch owners in the US today. Thursday marks the surprise reintroduction of the Apple Watch blood oxygen feature, redesigned for some Apple Watch Series 9, Series 10 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 owners. The feature will be available via a software update that's rolling out now. If you own one of these models and don't currently have access to the feature, you'll need to ensure your paired iPhone is updated to iOS 18.6.1 and that your Apple Watch is currently running watchOS 11.6.1. The updates will trigger sensor data collected from the Blood Oxygen app on your Apple Watch to be measured and calculated on your iPhone. The update was enabled by a recent US Customs ruling, the company noted in a blog post. Apple had previously been forced to disable Blood Oxygen monitoring in models shipped after January 2024. This was due to an import ban sparked by a patent dispute between Apple and a company called Masimo. By shifting the measurement and calculation of blood oxygen levels from the Apple Watch to the iPhone, Apple has managed to circumvent the ban. \"Apple's teams work tirelessly to create products and services that empower users with industry-leading health, wellness, and safety features that are grounded in science and have privacy at the core,\" Apple said."

And even though Cohere has fewer resources than Meta, Pineau said she’ll be more agile in her new role. Cohere’s latest product is an AI agent platform dubbed North that enterprises and government agencies can deploy privately on their own infrastructure, an attractive notion for many of its customers, which are banks and federal organizations that handle highly sensitive data. Cohere is betting that by offering more support around its private deployments, it can beat out open models. Pineau said she’s particularly interested in gearing more of Cohere’s research around North, figuring out ways to develop AI agents in private and secure settings, and creating benchmarks to evaluate these systems. But Pineau sees this as an opportunity to “bring in a lot of talent,” noting that when she left Meta, several of her former colleagues suggested they’d follow her to a new AI lab. Of course, Meta’s AI units today look very different compared with when Pineau was there just a few months ago."

    "summary": "If DJI is entering the 360-degree action camera market, why shouldn't Insta360 venture into drones? That was my immediate thought when the company announced its first drone, the A1, from a spin-off brand and team called Antigravity.\nSo, what is the A1? Is it an entry-level device? A camera for creators looking to spice up their videos without years of practice? A competitive POV drone? It’s a bit of all three, but the Antigravity A1 isn’t just a drone. It will eventually launch in a three-part set: the flying unit, OLED Vision goggles and a dedicated Grip motion controller.\nIn its current form, the Antigravity A1 weighs around 249 grams (8.8 ounces), which helps it duck around drone license requirements in most regions. (As it’s a preproduction model, this could change a little before it hits retail.) Two ultrawide cameras are positioned on the roof and underside of the drone instead of on the front. It’s like the Insta360 X5 camera is some sort of cocoon for the Antigravity A1.\nImage by Mat Smith for Engadget\nWith those two camera units, the A1 can capture video in 8K resolution, stretched across a sphere-like canvas from the drone’s point of view. With stitching algorithms that the company has continually improved over five generations of 360-degree cameras, this should result in mostly seamless footage where the A1 never interrupts the view.  The drone itself won’t show up in your video. It’s like the company’s “invisible” selfie stick, but, well, up in the sky.\nThe A1 is unlike any other drone I’ve played with — something I learned when I tested a pre-production unit at a Mercedes-Benz race track in Schlüsselfeld, Germany. Naturally, this included high-speed cars, wet conditions and some near-misses.\nThanks to working at Engadget, I’m a drone dabbler, but Antigravity’s A1 is a different experience from the outset. Controlling the A1 involves strapping on companion goggles and steering it from a first-person perspective, controller in hand. However, unlike other FPV drones, you can look (and move) anywhere you want.\n\nDuring roughly 15 minutes of flying time (you can see the highlights here), I found it’s a surprisingly intuitive experience. With other FPV drones, your view is locked to the direction of the camera. Sure, you can rotate rival drones to see elsewhere, like with DJI’s Avata, but it’s not the same. Because the A1 streams 360-degree video to the goggles, turning your head will never affect the direction it’s facing. Instead, you’ll just see what’s around the drone as it flies, making it far more intuitive for rookie drone pilots. Better still, you can strafe and move around while looking somewhere else — like video game controls for a first-person shooter.\nThis freedom of movement is elevated by the unique A1 controller, which is best described as a blend between a traditional drone controller and a Wiimote. While some of the physical buttons and dials adjust altitude, start/stop video recording and more, steering involves a point-and-click method. When you move your hand out to the right side, a reticle shows up on the goggles’ display. Pressing the trigger then will cause the A1 to shoot out in that direction, an action that Antigravity calls Freemotion control.\nAs I mentioned, this means I don’t have to look where I’m going — although it’s better if I do to avoid accidents (or collisions with an expensive Mercedes). If you’ve been intrigued by FPV drones, this is a simpler experience that feels freer, too. You can look wherever you want, not beholden to where cameras are pointed on other drones. I also think I could get friends and family flying the A1 around with minimal training. Speaking of spectators, Insta360 included a clever touch for them: the goggles have an external screen so that onlookers can see what’s happening. There is nothing duller than watching someone else fly a drone without being able to see their POV.\nImage by Mat Smith for Engadget\nThe A1 is a zippy little drone, presumably thanks to its low weight. But even at this preproduction stage, the resulting video looks better than I thought it would. Plus, it offers substantial versatility if you’re looking for action-packed shots.\nAfter I tested the A1, Antigravity sent me my video from the drone, so I was about to reframe, crop and reposition the footage. You could even use the same 10 seconds and frame (or crop) to three very different angles. For example, you could extract a tracking shot of the car, a zoomed-in shot of the drone pilot or just the blue skies of Germany all from one clip. That’s the exciting part here.\nInsta360 built excellent editing tools (mobile and desktop) for its cameras in the past, and it plans to do the same for its first drone. An early version of the software wasn’t without its hiccups, but editing was easy enough once I figured out that keyframes would anchor the drone's view. I could then add several keyframes together, tagging objects I’d like to keep in frame or track. Editing my footage started to get oddly enjoyable, and I have never enjoyed that task.\nAnother feature the company emphasized is payload detection. While the exact weight limit is still being refined through further testing, Antigravity says the A1 won’t be able to fly if the drone detects it’s carrying something it shouldn’t — a move to further smooth potential license issues. The company also hinted at future accessories and peripherals to expand the A1 experience — something it has successfully done with its action cams and gimbals.\nImage by Mat Smith for Engadget\nSome specs are still a mystery because the drone is a work in progress. To that end, the company is opening up applications for a co-creation project, where participants will get a pre-production Antigravity A1 in exchange for offering feedback. Ideas from these testers will be integrated into the final retail version, and the best ones could win a share of a $20,000 prize pool.\nFlying the A1 around a racetrack was the most fun I've had with a drone in a long time. But, with goggles and a dedicated controller included, how much will a flight cost? That might decide whether Insta360’s Antigravity can carve out a place next to DJI’s army of drones.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cameras/insta360-antigravity-a1-drone-preview-hands-on-130034274.html?src=rss",
    "full_text": "If DJI is entering the 360-degree action camera market, why shouldn't Insta360 venture into drones? Controlling the A1 involves strapping on companion goggles and steering it from a first-person perspective, controller in hand. During roughly 15 minutes of flying time (you can see the highlights here), I found it’s a surprisingly intuitive experience. Better still, you can strafe and move around while looking somewhere else — like video game controls for a first-person shooter. Speaking of spectators, Insta360 included a clever touch for them: the goggles have an external screen so that onlookers can see what’s happening. There is nothing duller than watching someone else fly a drone without being able to see their POV. But even at this preproduction stage, the resulting video looks better than I thought it would. Plus, it offers substantial versatility if you’re looking for action-packed shots. You could even use the same 10 seconds and frame (or crop) to three very different angles. Editing my footage started to get oddly enjoyable, and I have never enjoyed that task."

    "full_text": "If you'd rather go with a series, peruse our picks for the best TV shows to watch on Netflix. The 2015 film from writer-director George Miller is set in a post-apocalyptic desert and is essentially a nonstop battle sequence where hero Max Rockatansky (Tom Hardy) teams up with Theron's Imperator Furiosa to wage battle against warlord Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne) and his army. David James/Paramount Pictures Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation (2015) Netflix just released the first five movies in the Mission: Impossible franchise and while we really enjoy them all, 2015's Rogue Nation is one of our favorites. After reconnecting, the two friends explore their friendship and wonder what might have been had Nora never left. Grug doesn't always welcome learning new things from a human and Eep's curious, sometimes rebellious ways also contribute to family disagreements. Taylour Paige, Colman Domingo and Glynn Turman all co-star in the film that was adapted from August Wilson's 1982 play. Rustin's outspoken activism and homosexuality made him a target -- not just for political adversaries but sometimes even among his allies. After surviving an encounter with Godzilla, he and others realize the kaiju is gearing up to attack Tokyo. (It feels impossible to imagine so many mega-stars assembling in one room for something like this today.) Photo by Carlos Somonte Roma (2018) Alfonso Cuarón's Roma nabbed him the best director Oscar in 2018 (the film earned two other Oscars that year, too), a first for a foreign-language film."

The feature is applicable to properties that have a “flexible” or “moderate” cancellation policy. Flexible policies let users cancel their reservation up to 24 hours before they check in, while moderate policies allow for no-fee cancellations until five days before check-in. Users will need to pay the full amount for their booking before the listing’s free cancellation period ends. Airbnb will send users a reminder to pay before that date. The company is not new to the buy now, pay later arena. In 2018, it launched a “Pay part now, part later” product that allowed users to pay either 20% or 50% in the first tranche and the rest later. In 2023, the company teamed up with Klarna to let users pay for their stays in four installments over six weeks. Citing a survey it conducted with Focaldata, Airbnb said 55% of those surveyed preferred a flexible payment option while booking a stay, with 42% saying they missed out on properties while trying to figure out payment logistics with other travelers.

    "summary": "The back-to-school season is a good time to save on tech, whether you're returning to campus or not. While some discounts are reserved for students, others are available to everyone. One of the best right now is on Apple's M3-powered iPad Air, which is somewhat of a goldilocks tablet — one that will be a great option for just about everyone. You can grab it for $150 off at Amazon right now.\nThis deal applies to each configuration of the 11-inch and 13-inch versions of the most recent iPad Air. So, the 11-inch model is as low as $449, while the 13-inch model is down to $649. The same deals can be found at Best Buy and Target if you prefer to shop somewhere other than Amazon. This is an all-time low price and beats the deal we saw on Prime Day by $30. \n \nThe iPad Air M3 is more of an iterative refresh than a grand overhaul, but the spec bump means it’ll last you a long time before the tablet’s performance becomes a problem. This iPad occupies the position of \"best for most\" in our iPad buying guide, reinforcing that goldilocks analogy. The M3 chip is the main draw here, with Geekbench 6 scores proclaiming it around 16 percent more powerful than the M2 iPad Air, which is no slouch itself.\nBeyond the chip, it has a superior display and speakers to the entry-level model, and wider accessory support. You also get the option of a 13-inch display, which is great for artists or anyone who sees the iPad as a viable laptop replacement.\nIf there’s an obvious downside to the iPad Air M3, it’s that it doesn't have the nice 120Hz OLED display of the iPad Pro. This is hardly surprising, as Apple often focuses on display tech to differentiate its Pro and non-Pro devices, but it’s probably time the refresh rate on the middle-of-the-road iPad at least jumped up to ProMotion. Face ID is long overdue too. If you can live with these caveats, though, the iPad Air is an excellent option, particularly at this price.\nThere are a couple of other iPads on sale at Amazon right now, too, if you think the Air is too much for your needs. The iPad A16, Apple's entry-level tablet, is down to $299, while the latest iPad mini is on sale for $399. Both models were slightly cheaper during Prime Day in July, but these discounts are still worth considering if you're looking to pick up a newer iPad for less.\n \n \nCheck out our coverage of the best Apple deals for more discounts, and follow @EngadgetDeals on X for the latest tech deals and buying advice.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/apples-ipad-air-m3-is-150-off-right-now-162908718.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "HTC is once again attacking the wearable space with a pair of new smart glasses, the company announced. The Vive Eagle is a rival to Meta's Ray-Ban glasses with a fashion-foward lightweight design, open ear audio, voice-activated AI and an ultra-wide AI-powered camera. They look promising, if a bit expensive, but will only be available in Taiwan to start with.\nThe Taiwanese firm clearly noticed that Meta's Ray-Ban smart glasses have been a surprise hit. It's easy to see why — in our Engadget review, we found that they look great and perform admirably. The current model includes in-ear speakers, cameras, microphones and access to Meta’s virtual assistant.\nHTC has used much the same formula for the Vive Eagle, though they have an uphill battle against Ray-Ban's brand brand in terms of consumer awareness and  style. \"Vive Eagle features a refined aesthetic that conceals its powerful technology in clean, minimalist lines,\" the company wrote. It managed to fit all the technology into a relatively lightweight frame that weighs just 49 grams, only a gram heavier than Meta's Ray-Bans. \nHTC\nOn the camera side, the Vive Eagle comes with a 12MP ultra-wide model with voice-activated AI, offering support for multiple platforms including OpenAI and Gemini. \"With a simple voice command like 'Hey VIVE, take a photo,; users can capture what they see — right from their glasses,\" the company wrote. \nVoice commands also let you do things like record reminders, take notes, and get restaurant recommendations. You can also get real-time translation in 13 languages: Arabic, Traditional Chinese, English, French, German, Greek, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese, Spanish, Korean, Thai, Turkish.\nOn the audio side, the Vive Eagle has an open-ear setup that \"combines large acoustic drivers and virtual bass enhancement to deliver rich, spatial audio while minimizing sound leakage,\" HTC said. It promised that you'll be able to hear music or voice prompts without others overhearing, while still being aware of your surroundings.\n\nHTC promises up to 36 hours of standby time and 4.5 hours of continuous music playback thanks to the 235mAh battery, and you can get to a 50 percent charge (via magnetic fast charging) in just 10 minutes. It also features a \"privacy-first\" architecture with all video and other data stored exclusively on-device — and that is protected via 256-bit AES encryption, according to HTC. \nThe Vive Eagle will only available in Taiwan at first for NT$15,600, or about $520 — quite a bit more than most of Meta's Ray-Ban models. HTC has yet to say if it will bring the Vive Eagle to other territories including the US — but if it does and at that price, it'll be in tough against its rival. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/htc-takes-on-meta-with-the-vive-eagle-smart-glasses-120048879.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "We're likely only around a month away (give or take) from Apple's next iPhone launch event. This year's shindig could see the thinnest iPhone to date joining the iPhone 17 lineup. Also on tap could be new Apple Watch models — including the first Ultra model in two years — and (maybe) the long-awaited AirPods Pro 3.\nApple's iPhone family will likely welcome a new member this year. The iPhone Air is expected to be roughly 5.55 mm thick. The thinnest model so far has been 2014's iPhone 6, at 6.9 mm. And they've only gotten chunkier since then. (The iPhone 16 Pro has a depth of 8.25 mm.) So, the Air would stand out from its peers in that respect. It would also give Apple a direct rival to Samsung's Galaxy S25 Edge, which we found to be more than a gimmick.\nBut the iPhone Air's thin design will likely lead to some compromises. It's rumored to have only a single 48 MP camera and a smaller battery. So, expect a stylish phone that... won't be for everyone.\nBrian Oh for Engadget\nThe Pro lineup could offer some design tweaks and performance improvements. The iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max are rumored to switch from titanium to aluminum. They could also see the rear camera array expand to an entire \"island\" that extends across most of the phone's backside. It's expected to house three cameras (as before), but multiple rumors have suggested it will have an improved telephoto one. The zoom lens could jump to 48MP, which would strengthen its digital zooming / cropping chops. The phones may also add an anti-glare coating, similar to those found on iPads.\nThe standard iPhone 17 could see some welcome display upgrades. At least one supply chain source claimed it will add a 120Hz variable refresh rate (ProMotion) display, which the Pro series has used since 2021.\nApple\nOne thing we know without a doubt is that the new iPhones will launch with iOS 26, which brings Apple's biggest design refresh in years. It's easy to imagine the company highlighting the new model's displays as the best way to experience the new Liquid Glass visual language. As for the naming scheme, there haven't been any leaks pointing to a similar hardware rebranding (\"iPhone 26,\" \"iPhone 26 Pro,\" etc.). But hey, Apple does like surprises.\nEngadget's iPhone 17 rumor roundup gives you a deeper dive into what to expect from the new models.\nCherlynn Low for Engadget\nApple's fall event isn't just for iPhones. The company is also expected to roll out new Apple Watch models. 5G and a processor upgrade are expected for the Apple Watch Ultra 3. It may also let you send texts via satellite, handy for those who use it out in the wilderness. Regardless of the details, Apple hasn't launched a new rugged and premium model since 2023 (apart from a new color), so it's due for an upgrade.\nThe Series 11 model is unlikely to depart dramatically from the Series 10. After all, that model introduced a new design, with a thinner body and larger screen. (And Apple has historically kept those around in three-year cycles.). But a faster chip also seems logical. Perhaps we'll see 5G arrive on the standard wearable, too.\nWe may also see the AirPods Pro 3 at the event. It's been about three years since Apple last upgraded its premium earbuds. The new model could also bring some biometric sensors to the earphones: an in-ear heart-rate monitor and (maybe) temperature sensing. Live translation is also rumored, although that may not be exclusive to the third-gen model.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/what-to-expect-at-apples-iphone-17-event-090059189.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Tablets are the perfect middle ground between your phone and laptop, giving you the best of both worlds. Whether you want a lightweight device to binge your favorite shows, a larger screen for mobile gaming or a portable way to get some work done on the go, a tablet can do it all. They’re also great for keeping kids entertained, managing work tasks or sharing family moments through video calls. When a phone feels too small and lugging around a laptop is just too much, that’s where tablets fit into the mix.For many, the Apple iPad is the go-to choice, and it’s easy to see why with its smooth performance and endless app options. But don’t worry if iOS isn’t your thing — there are plenty of Android alternatives out there, offering the same level of flexibility without locking you into Apple’s ecosystem. Plus, if you’re on a budget, there are more affordable options that still pack a punch. Whether you’re looking for a premium tablet for work, a kid-friendly device with parental controls or just a reliable everyday companion, we’ve tested all of the big players (and many others) to find the best tablets worth your money right now.\nTable of contents\n\nBest tablets for 2025\nImportant things to consider before buying a tablet\nHow we test tablets\nOther tablets we tested\nTablet FAQs\nTablet accessories\n\nBest tablets for 2025\n \n \n \n \n \nImportant things to consider before buying a tablet\nBefore you start looking at specific devices, the number one thing you should do is figure out what you plan to use your new tablet for. That’s because if all you need is something to keep a kid busy, buying a brand new Apple iPad Air or iPad Pro doesn’t make a ton of sense. On the flip side, if you want to use a tablet for video editing or drawing, you’ll need to take things like performance, versatility and stylus support more seriously — especially if you're considering using it as a laptop replacement. \nYou’ll also want to think about stuff like how often you plan on traveling with the device and if it’s more for productivity, or for less demanding stuff like web browsing or streaming shows. There’s also an important trade-off to consider when it comes to battery life as well. Larger devices tend to have longer runtimes, though an increase in size may make it less portable.\nHow we test tablets\nWhen evaluating different tablets, there are a few important things we look for above all else: solid performance, a good screen and long battery life. For performance, we run a handful of synthetic tests like Geekbench 6, while also performing a number of hands-on, real-world use cases such as editing photos and playing games. And with tablets often serving as hybrid devices, we also consider how easy it is to multitask and switch quickly between various apps. The more responsive a device feels, the better.\nBecause a tablet’s display is such a critical component, we also view a wide range of content to gauge things like brightness, color gamut and dynamic range. It’s important to take into account the difference between various panel types like OLED, which typically produce richer colors and excellent contrast but may not be as bright as a mini LED display. Recently, refresh rate has become an increasingly important spec as 90Hz and 120Hz screens can make scrolling smoother and graphics appear sharper in games.\nWe also consider a tablet’s design (including things like size, weight and water resistance), its connectivity (WiFi, Bluetooth, NFC, 5G, et cetera) and special features like stylus support or the ability to serve as a secondary display. That’s because, while tablets were often viewed as content consumption devices in the past, higher-end devices like the Surface Pro and iPad Pro are more than capable of replacing a laptop for a lot of people.\nFinally, we test battery life by running our standard local video rundown test, which involves playing a single video on a loop from 100 percent until it runs out of juice. Ideally, a tablet should be able to last an entire working day, but longer runtimes are always welcome — especially for users relying on them for productivity, entertainment and storage options on the go.\nOther tablets we tested\nApple iPad mini\nApple updated the iPad mini for 2024 with some under-the-hood changes including a new processor and additional RAM to help support Apple Intelligence features. While the iPad mini is one of the best iPads you can buy, its small size makes it a bit niche. Only if you prefer your tablet be the size of an ereader should you consider this one.\nGoogle Pixel Tablet\nThe Google Pixel Tablet excels as a smart display rather than a simple tablet. As the latter, it's unexciting, but when paired with its speaker/charging dock, it becomes much more useful. It could be a good option for those that already live within the Google ecosystem and use the Google Assistant often, or those who like the idea of a tablet that can be docked and used as a smart display as well.\nOnePlus Pad\nThe solid OnePlus Pad is let down by Android because there aren't many Android apps designed to be used on a large display like this model's 11.6-inch panel. Otherwise, the hardware is well-designed, its companion stylus is comfortable to use and it has an excellent battery life.\nTablet FAQs\nWhat is the best brand for tablets?\nThe best brand for tablets is really the brand you feel most comfortable with. We recommend taking stock of the gadgets you already have — do you live in the Apple ecosystem already? An iPad might be best for you then. Do you have a Samsung phone? If so, a Galaxy Tab will likely be the most convenient choice. There is no one \"best brand\" for tablets; you’ll find good options made by companies including Apple, Google, Samsung, Microsoft and Amazon.\nCan a tablet replace a laptop?\nIt’s possible for a tablet to replace a laptop, but you’ll need a few accessories to truly make the experience as close as possible to that of a traditional notebook. A keyboard is a must, be it a keyboard case or a Bluetooth accessory that you keep with you. Some keyboard cases, like apple’s Magic Keyboard for the iPad, have a built-in trackpad, which will be more ergonomic than tapping on your tablet’s screen for input. Additionally, you could go one step further and use a wireless mouse that connects via Bluetooth to your tablet. If you’re primarily looking for a tablet to replace your laptop, consider buying a 2-in-1 laptop since those systems typically consist of high-powered tablets that are designed to work well with (and without) keyboards.\nWhat size screen do I need?\nFiguring out the best screen size for you will also be related to the kind of work (or play) you intend to do. Larger screens make it much easier to view two apps side by side, and big screens also deliver a more immersive movie viewing experience — especially when paired with an OLED display or Liquid Retina display. But at the same time, the larger the tablet, the less likely you’re going to want to move it around. That means you’re not only going to want to take stock of your workspace (i.e., if you have a desk or instead plan to work from a couch or even your bed), but you’re also going to want to think about how the device will fit into your everyday routine or commute (if you have one).\nTablet accessories\nFinally, you’ll want to consider any add-ons or accessories you’re planning to use, which can range from detachable keyboards to things like external mics or a stylus. The good news is that many of the best tablets nowadays offer some kind of keyboard accessory, which allows the device to function more like a 2-in-1 instead of simply being a content consumption device. Some tablets also feature things like microSD card slots that support expandable storage, or optional 4G or 5G connectivity, which can be a real boon to frequent travelers. And if you’re planning to use the tablet mainly for work, you might want to grab a USB hub for connecting all your favorite peripherals so your devices don’t have to fight for the charger.\nRecent updates\nJuly 2025: Updated to ensure our top picks and buying advice remain accurate.\nMay 2025: Updated to ensure our top picks and buying advice remain accurate.\nMarch 2025: Updated to include the latest base iPad in our top picks,\nFebruary 2025: Updated to include clarification around our top picks and new buying advice.\nOctober 2024: We updated this list to include information on the new iPad mini 7.\nJune 2024: We updated our top picks to include the Microsoft Surface Pro Copilot+ edition.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/best-tablets-150026056.html?src=rss",

Its screen isn’t quite as nice and its M2 chip is a couple generations old, but all the important things are there including Apple Pencil compatibility and the ability to attach a Magic Keyboard (though you’ll have to use an older model). These tablets are even rated IP68 for water and dust resistance – so if you want to take your S9 in the bath and watch a movie, you don’t have to worry about destroying it if it slips into the tub. Its neural processing unit (NPU) also enables potentially powerful AI features, though the current crop won’t be useful to everyone. It’s also nice to see Microsoft pack in 16GB of RAM with the base Surface Pro model. The A16 chip is plenty fast for most common iPad Things, while battery life remains solid at roughly 10 hours per charge. There’s also a handy dashboard for parents that allows you to set time limits, content filters and educational goals.

    "summary": "Liquid Glass is a huge new change coming to iOS 26. (Apple)\nNext month, we'll finally get the option to download iOS 26 on our iPhones (screenshots are way better in the latest operating system!). Until then, you can download and install the newly released public beta 2 (or iOS 26 developer beta 6 for developers). During Apple's recent earnings call, CEO Tim Cook said its collection of upcoming beta operating systems (including iOS) are \"by far the most popular developer betas we’ve had,\" 9to5Mac reports. You can also take a look at our preview of the iOS 26 public beta release, which shows off the fresh home and lock screen redesign. Called Liquid Glass, the new translucent look will extend across all of Apple's upcoming operating systems. The overhaul is one of several big changes coming to iOS, macOS, iPadOS and the rest of Apple's software suite, all of which were showcased during the company's WWDC keynote on June 9.\nAfter overpromising on AI plans last year, Apple kept its iOS roadmap focused more on basic quality of life improvements this year. There are multiple useful additions coming to the Phone and Messages apps on your iPhone, for instance: Apple execs outlined the ability to weed out spam texts or other unknown senders and an option to hold your spot on a phone call when you've been waiting for a representative to pick up. Plus, a treasured feature that we took for granted is coming back (hint: it's in the Photos app).\nSiri, meanwhile, is in a holding pattern. Apple has previously specified that its smarter voice assistant — first promised at WWDC 2024 — is delayed until some point \"in the coming year,\" so you shouldn't expect any major changes in the current betas. But there are reports that Apple is aiming to give Siri a bigger brain transplant by basing it on third-party artificial intelligence models like OpenAI's ChatGPT or Anthropic's Claude, which could make 2026 a pivotal year. The company is also reportedly working on a 'stripped-down' AI chatbot to rival ChatGPT.\nWith each beta, it seems like additional new improvements are popping up, like this new AirPods gesture we're all curious about, and this FaceTime feature that'll freeze your video if it detects nudity. With the release of the iOS 26 developer beta 5, we saw more added features, like a new bouncy animation on the passcode screen and in the Control Center, MacRumors reports. Some or all of those changes will likely soon migrate into the separate public beta (see below). Most newer iPhone models are eligible to download iOS 26 (both the betas and final version). Want to see the full list of new features coming this fall? Read on. \nWhat is iOS 26?\nThe current iPhone operating system is iOS 18, and Apple is still actively updating it — version 18.6 was just recently released. But don't expect to see iOS 19. Instead, Apple is skipping the numbering ahead to iOS 26 later this year. The company has decided to line up its iOS version numbers with a year-based system, similar to car model years. So while iOS and its sibling operating systems will be released in late 2025, they're all designated \"26\" to reflect the year ahead. \nIt's official, we're moving to iOS 26. (Apple)\nWhat is Liquid Glass design?\nLet's be honest. Out of everything announced at WWDC this year, the new Liquid Glass design was the star of the show. The iPhone's home and lock screens have looked pretty much the same year after year — the last exciting thing (in my opinion) was the option to add your own aesthetic to your home screen by customizing your apps and widgets. So seeing the home and lock screens' new facelift is refreshing.\nSo what exactly is Liquid Glass? Apple calls it a \"new translucent material\" since, well, the apps and widgets are clear. However, the screen can still adapt to dark and light modes, depending on surroundings. You'll also notice buttons with a new floating design in several apps, like Phone and Maps. They're designed to be less distracting than the current buttons, but are still easy to see. While the design overhaul has proven to be controversial since its announcement, some — including Engadget's own Devindra Hardawar — like the new direction, even if it's somewhat reminiscent of Microsoft's translucent Windows Vista Aero designs from nearly twenty years ago.\nThat said, as of the release of the iOS 26 beta 2, Apple has already incorporated some user feedback into the design, dialing back the transparency in at least some places. And while it will continue to evolve, Apple users won't be able to escape it: Liquid Glass was designed to make all of Apple's OSes more cohesive. Here's a look at how the translucent aesthetic will look with the new macOS Tahoe 26 on your desktop.\nWhat are the new and notable features of iOS 26?\niOS 26 has a laundry list of new features. Among the most worthwhile:\nPhone app redesign: You'll finally be able to scroll through contacts, recent calls and voicemail messages all on one screen. It also comes with a new feature called Hold Assist that'll notify you when an agent comes to the phone so you can avoid the elevator music and continue on with other tasks.\nLive Translation in Phone, FaceTime and Messages: iOS 26 is bringing the ability to have a conversation via phone call or text message with someone who speaks another language. Live Translation will translate your conversation in real time, which results in some stop-and-go interactions in the examples Apple shared during its presentation.\nPolls in group chats: Tired of sorting through what seems like hundreds of messages in your group chat? You and your friends will soon be able to create polls in group messages for deciding things like which brunch spot you're eating at or whose car you're taking on a road trip.\nFiltering unknown senders in Messages: If you haven't received spam texts about unpaid tolls or other citations, you're lucky. For those of us who have, those annoying messages will soon be filtered away in a separate folder.\nVisual Intelligence: Similar to a reverse Google image search, this new feature will allow you to search for anything that's on your iPhone screen. For instance, if you spot a pair of shoes someone is wearing in an Instagram photo, you can screenshot it and use Visual Intelligence to find those shoes (or similar ones) online.\nPhotos tabs are back: For anyone who's still frustrated with the Photos changes made last year, you'll be happy to know that your tabs are coming back. Library and Collections will have their own separate spaces so you don't have to scroll to infinity to find what you're looking for.\nFaceTime \"Communication Safety\" feature: A newer addition to iOS 26 appears to be the FaceTime \"Communication Safety\" feature that pauses communications if and when nudity is detected. The feature appears to be a child safety feature that uses on-device detection, thus obviating any cloud-based privacy issues. \nNew lock screen options: The iPhone lock screen gets more customizable in iOS 26, with a cooler clock, 3D wallpaper effects, more widgets and better focus mode options. \nApple's Hold Assist will be nifty for those pesky services that put you on hold for 10 or more minutes. (Apple)\nNew changes coming to iPadOS 26\nYour iPad isn't getting left behind when it comes to big updates. Here's what's coming this fall.\nMultitasking and real windowing: When you download the newest update, you'll be able to have multiple apps running on your screen at the same time. Once you open an app, it'll appear on your screen as normal but you'll be able to resize and move it across your screen to make room for other apps. This feature is optional so you can turn it off if you don't like it.\nVisual update: Along with the other new OSes, iPadOS 26 is coming with the Liquid Glass aesthetic. This new look will appear on the lock and home screens, as well as the drop-down menus.\nNew menu bar: When you swipe down on your screen, the new menu bar will appear with options like File, Edit, Windows and more. There's also a search option if you're looking for something specific.\nCheck out our first impressions of iPadOS 26. \nWhat about AirPods?\nAirPods are also getting updated with iOS 26. Here are some of the more notable functions.\nEnhanced audio recording: Apple calls this \"studio-quality\" audio recording, and with it, you'll notice more clarity while in noisy environments.\nCamera remote control: Using this, you can take a photo or start and stop video recording with just one press on your AirPods. When taking photos, you'll get a three-second countdown before your iPhone or iPad snaps the picture.\nLive translation feature: While not officially announced or confirmed, it appears that the long-rumored live translation for AirPods could be coming with iOS 26. The evidence comes from a system asset spotted in the in iOS 26 beta showing a gesture that's triggered by pressing both earbud stems at the same time. The photo also shows words in several different languages. \nWhich iPhones will be able to upgrade to iOS 26?\nA few iPhone models that run the current version of iOS — iPhone XR, XS and XS Max — won't be compatible with the latest upgrade. But any iPhones released in 2019 or later will be eligible for the iOS 26 update.\n\niPhone SE (second generation or later)\niPhone 11\niPhone 11 Pro\niPhone 11 Pro Max\niPhone 12\niPhone 12 mini\niPhone 12 Pro\niPhone 12 Pro Max\niPhone 13\niPhone 13 mini\niPhone 13 Pro\niPhone 13 Pro Max\niPhone 14\niPhone 14 Plus\niPhone 14 Pro\niPhone 14 Pro Max\niPhone 15\niPhone 15 Plus\niPhone 15 Pro\niPhone 15 Pro Max\niPhone 16\niPhone 16 Plus\niPhone 16 Pro\niPhone 16 Pro Max\niPhone 16e\n\nNot listed here are the presumed new iPhone 17 models (or maybe iPhone 26?) that are all but certain to be announced and released in September. \nHow to install iOS 26 beta\nThe iOS 26 public beta is now available to download via the Apple Beta Software Program. If you're not already a member, you'll need to sign up to try out all the latest features. Just visit beta.apple.com and sign up with your phone number or email address. It's free.\nOnce you're in, you can install it by going to Settings > General > Software Update and selecting iOS 26 public beta. \nA word of caution: Don't sign up with your main iPhone unless you're OK with any risks that occur with using an OS that isn't finalized.\nWhen will the final version of iOS 26 be released?\niOS 26 will be released to the public this fall. It usually comes in September, within a week of the Apple iPhone event. Last year, it rolled out to iPhone users on September 16 — exactly one week after the iPhone 16 lineup was announced.\nIf you're more interested in the Apple Intelligence features coming, here's everything Apple revealed for iOS, macOS and more during WWDC. Also, check out how iOS 26 screenshots could be an intriguing preview of Apple's delayed Siri rework.\nUpdate, August 13: Added new AirPods detail spotted in the iOS 26 beta.\nUpdate, August 11: Noted that iOS 26 developer beta has hit beta 6. \nUpdate, August 8: Added new features coming with iPadOS 26 and AirPods.\nUpdate, August 6: Noted the release of iOS 26 beta 5 and the new bouncy feature on passcode screen and Control Center.\nUpdate, August 4: Noted that Apple is reportedly working on a ChatGPT rival.\nUpdate, August 1: Added quote from Tim Cook about iOS 26.\nUpdate, July 31: Noted that iOS 18.6 is now available. \nUpdate, July 24: Noted the iOS 26 public beta is now available.\nUpdate, July 3: Noted new FaceTime feature found in the developer beta.\nUpdate, June 30: Noted ongoing iOS 18 releases, and reports that Apple is considering additional external LLMs for Siri. \nUpdate, June 25: Noted changes added in iOS 26 beta 2. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/ios-26-public-beta-2-adds-new-apple-features-everything-to-know-about-the-apple-iphone-updates-135749765.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "If Apple sticks to its usual schedule, we should see the company reveal its latest lineup of smartphones: the iPhone 17 models. The new models will come equipped with the latest iOS 26 features preinstalled, along with whatever additional features Apple reveals at the launch event. But since we still have to wait a few weeks (presumably) until the iPhone event, we can at least speculate what the new phones will look like. As with most unreleased iPhone models, rumors and leaks have trickled in about the hardware side ahead of the official introduction. Here's what we're expecting and what we can reasonably assume we'll get from Cupertino in September.\nHow much will the iPhone 17 cost?\nApple's announced plan to expand US-based manufacturing partners seems to give it at least some shielding from the steepest Trump administration tariffs that have already triggered price increases on everything from Switch consoles to high-end cameras to Sonos speakers. But given that President Trump's trade policies can change from week to week, and Apple's continuing reliance on Asia-based supply chains, price shocks remain an ongoing possibility. The bigger question is: Will Apple absorb any higher costs, or pass them on to consumers? \nIf prices do creep up, Apple may choose to pair it with an \"upgrade.\" Consider this recent rumor posted by MacRumors from a leaker known as \"Instant Digital,\" suggesting that the default storage of the iPhone 17 line may start at 256GB, doubling the current 128GB baseline. While that could be accompanied by a price increase of $50, Apple could at least pitch it as a \"better value.\" That said, the company doubled the default RAM of its Mac computers from 8GB to 16GB at no extra cost in 2024 — but that was before the current Trump tariff cycle started.\nWhen will the iPhone 17 series be announced?\nMost years, the flagship smartphones are introduced in September. MacRumors highlighted a story originally reported by iphone-ticker.de that the Apple iPhone 17 event could be Tuesday, September 9, according to information gleaned from German mobile phone providers.\nIt's still too early to have the specific dates; some years, Apple only gives a week or two of lead time between sending invites and hosting the event. But years of past precedent show that sometime in September should be when the 17 models make their debut. This family of smartphones may be the last to follow that trend, however. There have been hints that the introduction of the iPhone 18 collection in 2026 will be split into a pro-tier announcement in the fall and a standard model announcement the following spring.\nWhat will the new iPhone 17 lineup include?\nDesign leaks suggest that Apple is building an ultra-thin smartphone, likely to be named the iPhone 17 Air to match Apple's ultralight laptop designation. Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, often a solid source of advanced intel about Apple, reported in January that the iPhone 17 Air will be equipped with a basic A19 chip and will only have a single camera lens. It may also use Apple's new in-house modem, which was introduced in February on the iPhone 16e. More details about this development may leak ahead of September, but that's what we know for now.\nAn investor note from Apple analyst Jeff Pu indicated that the Air will have a titanium frame. If his reports are accurate, the lightweight smartphone will be the only entry in the iPhone 17 lineup to use that metal; the iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone 17 Pro Max are expected to be made of aluminum, which is oddly a lighter material than titanium. Other speculation had suggested that the Air would use a blend of aluminum and titanium, so the exact materials may not be known until the official announcement.\nAdditionally, an August 4 MacRumors report says the internal battery pack of the iPhone Air is just 2.49mm thick — half the thickness of the iPhone 17 Pro battery. The leak was posted on the Korean-language Naver blog, where they show the alleged batteries of the iPhone 17 Air and 17 Pro side by side. The same account claimed the 17 Air's battery capacity was a mere 2,800 mAh, MacRumors notes. (That's below the battery capacity of current iPhone 16 models.)\nA recent rumor from Majin Bu, whom MacRumors classifies as a \"hit-or-miss leaker,\" suggests the iPhone 17 Pro will have better wireless signal strength thanks to an updated antenna design. The individual posted a render on X that shows a new antenna system that wraps around the iPhone 17 Pro's supposedly wider rear camera bump. Again, this is a render, not a real-world photo. That said, we can't knock the goal of better wireless reception, so we're hoping this one has a degree of truth to it.\nEach new roster includes a base model, but over the years, Apple has shaken up the variety of phones it offers. Most likely there will be an iPhone 17 and an iPhone 17 Pro. Apple has also committed to the size matters philosophy, and has been building an iPhone Pro Max option with an even bigger screen and better battery life; the 17 roster will almost certainly have one as well. \nThe new Pro iPhones are said to have a full-width \"camera island\" on the rear, which would mark the first time an Apple model opted for that design. This feature can be seen in the purported iPhone 17 \"spotted in the wild.\" The pics, highlighted on MacRumors, show a black cased iPhone (17 Pro?) with the distinct back panel. Is it the real deal? The dual angles lend a degree of credibility in a social media landscape increasingly polluted with AI-enhanced fakes, but your guess is as good as ours.\nI just spotted a test development iPhone in the wild 🤩🤩🤩 pic.twitter.com/iS3PtKWqxJ— Fox Pupy 🦊🧡 (@Skyfops) July 28, 2025\n\nThe iPhone 17 Air seems primed to take the place of a potential iPhone 17 Plus. Since the iPhone 16e was only just introduced in February at a surprisingly high price point, it seems unlikely that there will be a new addition to that lower end of the spectrum, the models that were previously called SE. \nAt the very least, it sounds like the iPhone 17 Air won't take away the charging port and rely only on wireless connectivity. Bloomberg said that while Apple had investigated making the iPhone 17 Air without a single port, the company (fortunately) changed plans. He also says that the rumored phone will have a 6.6-inch screen and include the Dynamic Island and Camera Control button. Finally, the price is rumored at $900 — likely more than the standard iPhone 17 but less than the Pro.\nWe've also gotten what seems to be a reliable look at what the color lineup will be for the new smartphones. Macworld reported that the iPhone 17 will be available in black, white, steel gray, green, purple and light blue. The iPhone 17 Air will reportedly have four color options: black, white, light blue and light gold. While the Air colors will be less saturated, the visuals for the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max will go bold. The options for the Pro models are expected to be black, white, gray, dark blue and orange.\nOn July 30, Tom's Guide highlighted an X post from Sonny Dickson — a longtime and generally reliable leaker of unreleased iPhone information — showing \"dummy\" iPhone 17 models in the new colors that were the source of the aforementioned Macworld story. While these are literally just mock-ups — not real, leaked iPhones — it's interesting to see how the design and color rumors translate into a real-world look and feel.\nWhat will iOS 26 be like?\nApple upended its numbering conventions with WWDC 2025, and will match the name of each new operating system to the year it's released. So when the next wave of iPhones hits, they'll be running on iOS 26.\nOn the design side, the smartphone OS introduced during the big developer showcase took a contentious approach dubbed Liquid Glass. Apple has been scaling down the amount of transparency effects in the subsequent beta tests of iOS 26, but it will still have a glass-like visual.\nThe feature list includes big and small updates. On the more impactful side, the Phone and Photos apps have been redesigned. There will be several features leveraging artificial intelligence, such as live translation capabilities coming to Phone, FaceTime and Messages. Apple is also currently testing a sensitive content warning for child accounts that will freeze FaceTime video if nudity is detected by on-device machine learning tools. And the company is also launching Visual Intelligence, which will use AI to search for elements in an image.\niOS 26 also has a litany of minor, quality of life improvements. Group texts are getting support for polls. And for the slow risers out there, iOS 26 will finally let you escape the tyranny of the nine minute snooze alarm. \nThe next iOS is now available as a public beta. Here are our initial impressions of the Liquid Glass design and other new features. iOS 26 is compatible with all models back through iPhone 11.\nWhat other products are expected to be released alongside the iPhone 17?\nIf Apple follows its usual pattern, the iPhone 17 will be announced alongside new Apple Watch products. That would be the Apple Watch Series 11 (if Apple sticks to the same naming scheme), and maybe an Apple Watch Ultra 3 and/or an updated Apple Watch SE. (They'll all run watchOS 26, of course.)\nOther possibilities — and this is, again, speculation — could include refreshed Apple AirPods Pro (which received its last big update in 2022) and maybe new AirTags trackers (first released in 2021).\nBut knowing Apple doesn't like to take the spotlight off its star performer — the iPhone — those accessories could come sometime later in the year (if they appear this year at all). The same goes for rumored refreshes of the Apple TV and HomePod mini, which are also getting long in the tooth.\nDon't expect any Macs or iPads, however. Apple has recently been holding computer updates for late October (as it did last year with the new M4 Macs).\nUpdate, August, 13, 2025, 10:02PM ET: Added a list of the products that are expected to be released alongside the iPhone 17s. \nUpdate, August 11, 2025, 7:27PM ET: Added a render of a rumored new antenna design for the iPhone 17 Pro.\nUpdate, August 8, 2025, 4:43PM ET: Added new speculation and reports about iPhone 17 pricing.\nUpdate, August 6, 2025, 4:05PM ET: Added latest details about the potential iPhone 17 event date.\nUpdate, August 4, 2025, 5:23PM ET: Added latest battery leaks about the iPhone 17 models.\nUpdate, August 1, 2025, 8:15AM ET: Added new photos showing potential iPhone 17 colors.\nUpdate, July 30, 2025, 11:08AM ET: Added latest leaks and rumors about the iPhone 17, and updated information on the iOS 26 public beta.\nUpdate, July 17, 2025, 4:40PM ET: Added latest information about iOS 26, possible materials for the Air, and the color options for the different models.\nUpdate, March 17, 2025, 2PM ET: Added details about the rumored price and features of the iPhone 17 Air.\nUpdate, April 11, 2025, 3:45PM ET: Added details from Front Page Tech's new video that claims to reveal details from a leaked iOS 19 build.\nKatie Teague contributed to this story.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/iphone-17-release-is-rumored-for-september-everything-you-need-to-know-ahead-of-the-apple-fall-event-153024317.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "\niOS 26 and iPadOS 26 are coming this fall, bringing huge upgrades to your iPhone and iPad's operating systems. A pretty cool option available on both is the visual update, called Liquid Glass — it's like the better-executed version of Windows Vista. We spent two weeks test-driving it — you can check out our detailed hands-on iOS 26 preview, or you can try it out yourself by downloading and installing the public beta 2. That software is a more stable iteration of the separate developer version, which recently hit the beta 6 waypoint, and offers a few more flashy features not yet available in the public version. (While the public beta is open to everyone and quite stable, always remember there's a degree of risk involved with beta software.) Additionally, there are credible reports that iOS 26 could bring a new live translation feature to AirPods, too. Not ready to upgrade your smartphone or tablet this year? No worries, we'll help you find out if your devices will be able to run iOS 26.\nWhile Apple didn't nix any iPhones from its eligibility list last year, that's not the case for 2025 — a few models are getting cut this time. All iPhone 8 models and the iPhone X were the last to get the boot in 2023, and this year the 2018 models are getting left behind. If you have an ineligible device, you won't be able to download iOS 26 when it becomes available this fall. \nWe'll get to the bottom of which iPhones and iPads will support iOS 26 and iPadOS 26 this year. To see what's coming with the latest OSes, check out everything announced at Apple's WWDC June 9 event. One thing you shouldn't immediately expect is Apple's updated version of Siri, though the company is reportedly working on a 'stripped-down' AI chatbot to compete with ChatGPT. \nThese three iPhones won't be compatible with iOS 26\nUnlike last year, several iPhone models won't be eligible to download the newest iOS when it makes its debut this fall. This trio of models first released in 2018 won't be coming to the iOS 26 party:\n\niPhone XR\niPhone XS\niPhone XS Max\n\niPhones compatible with iOS 26\nWhile we don't yet know the new iPhones Apple will be dropping this fall — though there are iPhone 17 rumors — we do know, per Apple's site, that the phones listed below will be compatible with iOS 26. Basically, if you have an iPhone that was announced in 2019 or later, you're in the clear:\n\niPhone SE (second generation or later)\niPhone 11\niPhone 11 Pro\niPhone 11 Pro Max\niPhone 12\niPhone 12 mini\niPhone 12 Pro\niPhone 12 Pro Max\niPhone 13\niPhone 13 mini\niPhone 13 Pro\niPhone 13 Pro Max\niPhone 14\niPhone 14 Plus\niPhone 14 Pro\niPhone 14 Pro Max\niPhone 15\niPhone 15 Plus\niPhone 15 Pro\niPhone 15 Pro Max\niPhone 16\niPhone 16 Plus\niPhone 16 Pro\niPhone 16 Pro Max\niPhone 16e\n\niPads compatible with iPadOS 26\nThe iPads listed below, and any iPads released later this year, are eligible to download iPadOS 26.\n\niPad Pro (M4)\niPad Pro 12.9‑inch (3rd generation and later)\niPad Pro 11‑inch (1st generation and later)\niPad Air (3rd generation and later, including M2 and M3)\niPad (8th generation and later, including A16)\niPad mini (5th generation and later, including A17 Pro)\n\nWhat if I don't want to buy a new iPhone?\nIf you want to continue using your older iPhone that isn't supported by iOS 26, that's fine. However, you'll miss out on security updates which could potentially put your phone at risk for malware and other threats. Additionally, some apps may stop working if they require a certain version of iOS or later. And of course, you won't be able to access the latest features iOS 26 offers.\nWhen will iOS 26 become available?\nApple usually rolls out its latest iOS in mid-September, just a few days before the new iPhones hit store shelves. Last year, it released iOS 18 on Monday, Sept. 16. Expect a confirmation of the release date at the iPhone 17 event, expected in early September. \niOS 26 features we're excited about\nLiquid Glass design: Your home screen is getting revamped with new app icons, including dark mode and all-clear options. You'll also notice buttons with a new floating design. Liquid Glass was designed to make all of Apple's OSes more cohesive.\nPhone app redesign: You'll finally be able to scroll through contacts, recent calls and voicemail messages all on one screen. It also comes with a new feature called Hold Assist that'll notify you when an agent comes to the phone so you can avoid the elevator music.\nLive Translate: iOS 26 is bringing the ability to have a conversation via phone call or text message with someone who speaks another language. Live Translate will translate your conversation in real time. \nPolls feature: Coming to group messages in the Messages app, chat members will be able to create polls. This can help prevent the unwanted 30+ messages when it comes to deciding which restaurant you're meeting at this weekend.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/ready-for-apples-ios-26-these-are-all-the-compatible-iphones-that-can-run-public-beta-2-right-now-191854071.html?src=rss",

It would be able to swivel to face the screen toward a user as they move around their home or office. Sources said the current prototype uses a horizontal display that's about seven inches while the motorized arm can move the screen about six inches away from the base in any direction.

The idea of a smart home hub was apparently floated at the company as far back as 2022, and it's finally being rumored to have a formal debut some time this year. Robots have also been a topic of interest in Cupertino for some time, with claims that Apple was developing a personal robot dating back at least to last spring.

It was previously confirmed that the Pebble Time 2 would have a quick-release 22mm strap, flat hardened glass lens, step and sleep tracking and a speaker. The watch will also boast a vibration function and water resistance. Once it has, it will email everyone who has pre-ordered the smartwatch and ask them to pick a color. The Pebble Time 2 is currently scheduled to start shipping in December and it will cost $225 (the $149 Pebble Duo 2 became available last month). As such, they were able to start using the Pebble branding again and renamed what were previously called the Core 2 Duo and Core Time 2."

    "summary": "One thing I need to make clear right from the start: this is a review of Norton VPN (formerly Norton Secure VPN, and briefly Norton Ultra VPN) as a standalone app, not of the VPN feature in the Norton 360 package. They're similar, but Norton VPN has a few more features, including the ability to choose cities as server locations in countries with more than one option.\nI'll state my opinion up front. Norton VPN isn't a bad service, but it's not good enough to get ahead of its direct competitors. ExpressVPN, Surfshark, Proton VPN and NordVPN are all either faster, more feature-rich, more secure, more affordable or some combination of the four. There's no reason to go with Norton as your VPN unless you're getting it as part of another Norton 360 bundle. \nFor this review, I ran rigorous tests that highlighted Norton VPN's strengths (well-designed user interfaces, a verified privacy policy) along with its weaknesses (holes in its security, renewals that double the price, weak customer support). Norton's history of focusing on Windows means that app is by far the most complete; if you're on any other platform, expect to miss out on the best VPN protocols and the complete feature set.\nEditors' note: We're in the process of rebooting all of our VPN reviews from scratch. Once we do a fresh pass on the top services, we'll be updating each review with a rating and additional comparative information.\n \nTable of contents\n\nFindings at a glance\nInstalling, configuring and using Norton VPN\nNorton VPN speed test\nNorton VPN security test\nHow much does Norton VPN cost?\nNorton VPN side apps and bundles\nClose-reading Norton VPN's privacy policy\nCan Norton VPN change your virtual location?\nInvestigating Norton VPN's server network\nExtra features of Norton VPN\nNorton VPN customer support options\nNorton VPN background check\nFinal verdict\n\nFindings at a glance\nUse this table as a quick reference for my test results, investigations and thoughts about Norton VPN. For more details, jump to the relevant section using the table of contents above.\n\n\n\nCategory \nNotes \n\n\nInstallation and UI \nAll apps install easily Navigation is intuitive, with clearly labeled tabs and explanations of each feature Mac and iOS apps lack several options, including split tunneling Browser extensions are the only way to use the ad blocker Smart TVs are also supported \n\n\nSpeed \nRelatively significant average speed drop of 21.1 percent Download speeds varied with distance, which can be a sign of outdated infrastructure Upload speeds dropped an average of 9.5 percent Mean worldwide latency was 322 ms, putting Norton in the middle of the pack \n\n\nSecurity \nWindows and Android apps have WireGuard, OpenVPN and Mimic; Mac and iOS apps just have IKEv2 and Mimic Mimic uses vetted encryption, but I still recommend using open-source protocols wherever possible Unless kill switch is enabled, your real IP address is visible while switching server locations \n\n\nPricing \nYou can only subscribe for one year at a time After one year, renewal pricing kicks in, doubling the annual fee The Standard plan, which includes all VPN features, costs $39.99 for the first year and $79.99 for future years All plans can be refunded for 60 days \n\n\nBundles \nPlus plans add most of the functionality of Norton Antivirus, but without manual scans, disk cleanup or email monitoring Ultimate adds parental controls and personal data removal Norton VPN is also available through several Norton 360 plans, with reduced features \n\n\nPrivacy policy \nNorton's general privacy policy allows far too much data collection, but Norton VPN's rules are stricter An audit in 2024 found that Norton VPN posed little or no privacy risk \n\n\nVirtual location change \nMost servers changed my virtual location to access a different Netflix library Iceland location was repeatedly blocked \n\n\nServer network \n106 server locations in 66 countries Good distribution across northern and southern hemispheres No information on virtual server locations \n\n\nFeatures \nCan block ads on mobile and browsers; browser version can allow certain acceptable ads Some locations connect through a second server, while others continually rotate your IP address Kill switch works but is only available on iOS through Mimic Windows and Android users get split tunneling by app Can scan wi-fi networks for common attacks \n\n\nCustomer support \nWindows users have the most in-app debugging options — all other platforms just link to the website FAQs are hard to navigate and have little useful information Tech support prefers to call rather than email \n\n\nBackground check \nNorton Antivirus was first offered in 1991, but Norton VPN didn't launch until 2019 as part of the Norton 360 resurrection No serious controversies during that time \n\n\n\nInstalling, configuring and using Norton VPN\nHere, I'll do my best to convey how it feels to use Norton VPN on various platforms. Its apps for Windows, Mac, Android, iOS and browsers are all similar, but there are distinctions in both design and features.\nWindows\nOnce you download the Norton VPN app from its website or the Microsoft Store, an installation wizard takes over and makes the rest of the process easy. You'll have to click to grant a few permissions and skip through a tutorial, but after that, you're free to move about the interface.\n\n\n\n\n   Sam Chapman for Engadget \n \n\nNorton VPN's Windows UI was a pleasant surprise. There's no wasted detail on the front page. Click the large yellow button to connect to the VPN, or select the server name to go to the location list, which is alphabetized. Clicking the very first entry in the list connects you to the fastest location. IP rotator servers and double VPN routes are grouped under tabs below that. There's no clutter and no aggressive popups, and connections happen quickly.\nYou'll find four tabs on the left-hand side of the Window. The top one manages the VPN. Then there's a store for other Norton products (IMO the only real misstep), a set of help pages and the controls for the VPN's settings and features. This last is subdivided into a row of easily understandable subtabs. I'm impressed by how seamlessly the design works in explanations of what each setting does — it makes the whole thing that much more accessible.\nMac\nDownloading Norton VPN for Mac is a quick and painless process, with one slight difference from Windows: you'll have to mess around a bit in System Preferences to give Norton the permissions it needs. Fortunately, the setup wizard guides you through the steps with text and animations.\n\n\n\n\n   Sam Chapman for Engadget \n \n\nThe actual interface is just as free of clutter as the Windows app — more so in some cases, as there's no shilling of the rest of the Norton family. The downside is that there's also no help center access from the main window; you have to go to Settings -> Troubleshooting to find the link. There also aren't links to specific help articles like the Windows app includes.\nAndroid\nOne word of warning about Norton VPN's mobile apps: you need an internet connection for the initial login and setup. It doesn't appear to be opening a website, but if you don't have web access, you'll get stuck in an endless loading loop.\nThe front pages of Norton VPN's desktop apps don't have many design elements, so the same general schematic is easy to compress onto mobile. The Android client has a status indicator, a large button to start your connection, tabs along the bottom and a gear icon for settings in the top-right. It's all intuitive and responsive.\n\n\n\n\n   Sam Chapman for Engadget \n \n\nIf I were to change anything, though, I'd take some of the options from the upper-right settings menu and swap them with the bottom tabs for notifications and accounts settings. VPN preferences should be accessible in one click, especially protocols. Frankly, the messages you get from this app aren't important enough to merit such pride of place.\niOS\nNorton VPN's apps for iPhone and iPad are almost identical to its Android app. The only real difference is that the iOS client is missing some features, most notably split tunneling; also, the kill switch is only available on the Mimic protocol, about which there's limited information. Other than that, it feels good to use. While it's not great that Apple users lose out on the full feature set, I can't deny it alleviates the problem of the VPN preferences menu feeling overstuffed.\n\n\n\n\n   Sam Chapman for Engadget \n \n\nBrowser extensions\nNorton VPN has browser extensions for Chrome, Firefox and Edge. The only reason to install any of these is to access the ad blocker, which doesn't come with either of the desktop apps. Other than that, it's an underwhelming extension. I recommend skipping it and going with a dedicated ad blocker instead — you'll get more customization features that way.\n\n\n\n\n   Sam Chapman for Engadget \n \n\nNorton VPN speed test\nUsing speedtest.net, I tested Norton VPN to see how much it slowed down my browsing speeds. I then calculated the results as percentages. While different networks give you different starting speeds, the same server location tends to slow down all those networks at about the same rate. You can use this table to estimate how much speed you can expect while Norton VPN is running.\nAs a reference, you generally need download speed for loading web pages and videos, upload speed for sending large amounts of data and latency for real-time communication. Latency always increases sharply over longer distances, but a good VPN can still keep the jumps under control. Let's see how Norton VPN did.\n\n\n\nServer location \nLatency (ms) \nIncrease factor \nDownload speed (Mbps) \nPercentage drop \nUpload speed (Mbps) \nPercentage drop \n\n\nPortland, OR, USA (unprotected) \n18 \n— \n58.90 \n— \n5.91 \n— \n\n\nPortland, OR, USA (protected) \n30 \n1.7x \n55.83 \n5.2 \n5.53 \n6.4 \n\n\nMcAllen, TX, USA \n164 \n9.1x \n48.96 \n16.9 \n5.70 \n3.6 \n\n\nArgentina \n422 \n23.4x \n43.02 \n27.0 \n5.72 \n3.2 \n\n\nCroatia \n379 \n21.1x \n46.35 \n21.3 \n5.65 \n4.4 \n\n\nNigeria \n564 \n31.3x \n39.94 \n32.2 \n3.86 \n34.7 \n\n\nIndonesia \n375 \n20.8x \n44.88 \n23.8 \n5.64 \n4.6 \n\n\nAverage \n322 \n17.9x \n46.50 \n21.1 \n5.35 \n9.5 \n\n\n\nBefore I interpret the results, I should mention that the algorithm Norton VPN uses to pick the fastest server doesn't seem to be reliable. Every time I clicked it, it gave me the server in Texas, thousands of miles from my real location in Portland, Oregon. Moreover, the Portland server was obviously faster. This happened repeatedly over multiple days of testing.\nTo the point: this table doesn't look good for Norton VPN. Download speeds dropped an average of 21.1 percent, the worst showing of any VPN I've tested so far. What's worse, the data clearly trend toward worse speeds at greater distances. Although it's true that distance impacts download speed as well as latency, it's also true that a well-implemented modern server OS should be able to render that effect minimal.\n\n\n\n\n   Sam Chapman for Engadget \n \n\nUpload speed looks better, with an average drop of under 10 percent — mainly dragged down by the Nigeria server, which cut speeds sharply across every test. Latency is also not awful. Controlling for the expected variance due to distance, Norton VPN beat out both Surfshark and NordVPN in average worldwide ping, which suggests that gaming may be its comfort zone.\nNorton VPN security test\nA VPN's primary job is to change your IP address. While doing this, it must also encrypt your communications with its servers so nobody can follow your connection home — this is what separates a VPN from a simple proxy. In this section, I'll run three checks to see whether Norton VPN can guarantee anonymous browsing.\nVPN protocols\nVPNs use protocols to establish stable connections between your devices and their servers. Most providers pick from the same pool of field-tested options, but you do see a surprise every now and then, like Norton VPN's Mimic.\nNorton VPN's protocol selection follows its general trend of serving very different experiences to users on different platforms. Windows and Android users get WireGuard, OpenVPN and Mimic, while macOS and iOS users only get Mimic and IKEv2. Here's a rundown of each.\n\nWireGuard is the most modern open-source VPN protocol currently available. It's almost always the fastest and uses a secure stream cipher for cryptography. The one downside is that it saves your real IP address to keep the connection open. Norton VPN deals with this by assigning temporary dynamic IP addresses during the authentication process.\nOpenVPN is an open source protocol that's been in use for ages. Its source code is slightly clunky after years of volunteers poking it for weaknesses, but that also makes it the most trustworthy option. It's fast on average, though usually slower than WireGuard or IKEv2.\nIKEv2 is a fast protocol that's good at reconnecting mobile devices as they move between networks. Norton VPN uses it in conjunction with IPSec encryption. If you're on an Apple device, it's your only option other than Mimic.\nMimic is an obfuscation protocol, which makes your VPN connection look like regular HTTPS traffic. This can get around networks that block all VPN traffic regardless of content. Mimic is based on TLS 1.3, and uses the same standard encryption algorithms as the other protocols.\n\nNormally, I advise letting your VPN choose what protocol is best. Norton VPN is different. There simply isn't enough information about Mimic for me to trust it, and you shouldn't let the VPN switch you to it without your knowledge. All the others are fine, though.\nLeak test\nTesting a VPN for leaks is easy: just check your IP address before and after connecting, and see if it changes. I used IPleak.net to run that test on several Norton VPN servers. I first observed that Norton VPN prevents IPv6 leaks by blocking IPv6 altogether. On every run, the IPv6 test failed to load, no matter which server location I chose. This is an effective way to make leaks impossible, since almost none of the internet is IPv6-only yet.\n\n\n\n\n   Sam Chapman for Engadget \n \n\nMy second conclusion was that Norton VPN's servers don't leak through DNS or WebRTC while your connection remains stable. However, every time I changed from one location to another, my real IP address was visible on the test screen for several seconds. Enabling the kill switch solved this problem, but the kill switch is not active by default, so make sure you turn it on in the settings.\n\n\n\n\n   Sam Chapman for Engadget \n \n\nThere is one other serious problem with this: on the iOS app, the kill switch cannot be used except with the Mimic protocol. This forces users to choose between leaving a hole in their security or trusting it to a protocol with limited transparency. Until this changes, I can't recommend installing Norton VPN on iOS at all.\nI tested the rotating IP server in the United States to see if it had the same problem, and thankfully didn't notice it. A Norton representative also confirmed that all servers have their own DNS resolvers that avoid public servers, cutting off a big source of leaks. Still, I'd recommend keeping the kill switch engaged. As long as you remember this, Norton VPN is secure.\nEncryption test\nFinally, I ran a test with WireShark to see if Norton VPN's protocols managed to encrypt my traffic. Since I've been uncertain about Mimic, I used it for the encryption test. I found that Mimic does in fact encrypt data packets, even on an unsecured HTTP connection. WireShark also confirmed to me that Mimic is using TLS for key exchange and encryption.\n\n\n\n\n   Sam Chapman for Engadget \n \n\nHow much does Norton VPN cost?\nNorton VPN subscriptions are only available for one year at a time — there's no monthly option. There are three different subscription tiers, summarized in the table below. \"Number of devices\" refers to how many devices you can have installed on a single account, whether or not any of them are connected to the VPN.\n\n\n\nSubscription \nStarting price (One year) \nRenewal price (One year) \nNumber of devices \nFeatures \n\n\nStandard \n$39.99 \n$79.99 \n5 \nBasic VPN service, IP rotation, double VPN, kill switch \n\n\nPlus \n$49.99 \n$109.99 \n5 \nAntivirus, password manager, dark web alerts, 10GB cloud backup \n\n\nUltimate \n$59.99 \n$129.99 \n10 \nParental controls, device locator \n\n\n\nThe Standard subscription is a reasonable price for what you get, but the superior Proton VPN is barely more expensive and Surfshark is actually cheaper. In other words, Norton VPN is a good price, but not great value — especially when you factor in the renewal prices, all of which force you to pay double or more what you paid the first time. If you'd like to decide for yourself, all the plans do come with a 60-day money-back guarantee.\nNorton VPN side apps and bundles\nNorton is better known as an antivirus company than a VPN provider, so naturally Norton VPN is packaged with the rest of the Norton 360 family. Be warned — unless you turn the option off in the Settings -> Privacy tab, Norton will collect information on your app usage and use it to target you with ads for its other products.\nNorton 360 is a massive product line encompassing dozens of individual subscriptions. To keep this section from bloating, I'll focus on the software available as part of an upgraded Norton VPN subscription, then end by listing the Norton 360 plans that include Norton VPN.\nFeatures on Norton VPN Plus\nA Norton VPN Plus subscription adds several features from Norton's antivirus suite, but isn't a complete replacement for Norton or any other dedicated antivirus software. Plus users get most of the antivirus features that work in real time, including a smart firewall, anti-ransomware backups, a sandbox for quarantining suspicious programs and a malicious script blocker.\nVPN subscribers do not get access to the quicker Smart Scan option, instead getting a different scan feature that checks for online threats (note that the FAQ page about this erroneously says Norton VPN includes Smart Scan). VPN users also miss out on the LiveUpdate feature that installs security patches autonomously, plus the automated hard drive cleaner.\nFeatures on Norton VPN Ultimate\nIn addition to raising the device limit to 10, Norton VPN Ultimate adds two features on top of Plus: parental controls and Privacy Monitor. The latter is only available in the US and Canada.\nParental control is both a time-based site blocker and a monitoring app. It can not only track a child's internet activity, but also their physical location, giving you alerts if they leave set boundaries during a certain time (say school property during a weekday). Privacy Monitor scans for your information on data brokerage sites so you can send deletion requests, similar to Surfshark Incogni.\nNorton 360 plans that include Norton VPN\nInstead of subscribing to Norton VPN directly, you can also pick a Norton 360 plan that includes VPN service. Norton 360 Standard and Norton 360 For Gamers each let you install Norton VPN on three devices. Norton 360 Deluxe raises that number to five, while Norton 360 with Lifelock Select and Norton 360 with Lifelock Advantage grant you 10 total VPN installs. Norton 360 with Lifelock Ultimate Plus lets you install Norton VPN on an unlimited number of devices.\nClose-reading Norton VPN's privacy policy\nTo assess Norton VPN's privacy, we need to look at two different privacy policies. Like I said in the introduction, there are technically two products called Norton VPN — the standalone service I've been reviewing and the VPN features of the Norton 360 bundle. I've been focused on the independent Norton VPN so far, but since the Norton 360 VPN add-on is a privacy risk, I want to mention it here.\nNorton lists the privacy policies for each of its products on one page of its website. The VPN feature of Norton 360 is governed by the top two policies, Norton Security Products (desktop) and Norton 360 Mobile Apps. The standalone Norton VPN has its own policy further down the page.\nThe Norton 360 policy is a privacy nightmare. Both the desktop and mobile apps claim the right to save your IP address, device fingerprints and web activity for up to 36 months, and there's no exception for the VPN feature. I strongly advise against using Norton 360's bundled VPN for any activity you don't want Norton seeing.\nFortunately, Norton holds the standalone VPN to a much more acceptable set of rules. It isn't permitted to collect IP addresses, browsing history or DNS requests, nor can it share any of the data it does collect with partners. The partners note is important because one of Norton's sibling companies, Avast, is known to have sold information on its users to corporations for ad targeting. A Norton representative stated that Avast is no longer involved in harvesting or selling user data. More importantly, he said that no data from VPN products is shared between Gen Digital brands.\nIndependent privacy audits\nA recent audit by penetration testing firm VerSprite provides reason to be hopeful about Norton VPN's privacy. According to a report published in August 2024, which you can download from this page, VerSprite found that Norton VPN posed an overall \"low\" privacy risk, judged on a scale of low, medium, high and critical risks.\nDuring their audit, VerSprite informed Norton that certain conditions could make VPN users identifiable. In a second round of tests, Norton appears to have fixed those vulnerabilities. That's certainly reassuring, but I wish the report — which only runs three pages in all — was more specific about what the problem actually was. Regardless, the VerSprite audit is a good sign that Norton VPN is taking privacy more seriously than Norton as a whole.\nCan Norton VPN change your virtual location?\nIf a VPN can change your virtual location, it can not only throw ISPs and other interlopers off your real identity, but also change what you see on the internet — especially on streaming sites, where connecting through a different country can unlock new shows. However, Netflix and its brethren block VPN traffic for copyright reasons, so it's never a guarantee that you'll get in.\n\n\n\n\n   Sam Chapman for Engadget \n \n\nI tested Norton VPN's ability to unblock Netflix on five different locations, connecting three times on three different servers in each place. I set the app to automatically choose the protocol. In the table below, you'll see how many tests each location passed, and whether Netflix showed new content each time. If I get into Netflix but the library doesn't change, that indicates the server might be leaky.\n\n\n\nServer location \nUnblocked Netflix? \nChanged content? \n\n\nVancouver, Canada \n3/3 \n3/3 \n\n\nIceland \n0/3 \n0/3 \n\n\nLatvia \n3/3 \n3/3 \n\n\nMorocco \n3/3 \n3/3 \n\n\nPhilippines \n3/3 \n3/3 \n\n\n\nI had no problems in four out of five of the locations I tested, but Netflix utterly defeated the Iceland servers. No matter how many times I disconnected and reconnected to get a new IP address, Netflix recognized a VPN server and blocked me. This happened even when I switched to the Mimic protocol.\n\n\n\n\n   Sam Chapman for Engadget \n \n\nThat indicates that Netflix has blocklisted most or all of Norton VPN's servers in Iceland, and the company hasn't caught up. It's another troubling indication that Norton isn't committing the level of attention that its server network requires.\nInvestigating Norton VPN's server network\nSpeaking of the server network, now's the time to get deeper into it. The relative scarcity of different IP addresses on Norton VPN, along with the download speed drops over long distances, suggest to me that Norton might have relegated maintaining VPN data centers to an afterthought. So, let's see what its worldwide server selection looks like.\n\n\n\nRegion \nCountries with servers \nTotal server locations \n\n\nNorth America \n5 \n32 \n\n\nSouth America \n6 \n6 \n\n\nEurope \n36 \n47 \n\n\nAfrica \n5 \n5 \n\n\nMiddle East \n2 \n2 \n\n\nAsia \n10 \n10 \n\n\nOceania \n2 \n4 \n\n\nTotal \n66 \n106 \n\n\n\nAll of Norton VPN's server locations are physical, with no virtual locations. This makes its network more reliable — virtual server locations can deliver unexpected speed swings. However, it does limit the number of locations Norton is capable of offering.\nThe selection is reasonably good, with many locations in often-underserved Africa and South America, and many options in marquee regions like the US and Europe. However, it's a pretty small network for what Norton is charging. Also, as we saw with the Iceland location getting blocked by Netflix, having a country on the menu doesn't necessarily mean it will do the job.\nExtra features of Norton VPN\nNorton VPN added a ton of features in the first several months of 2025. Most of these mainly brought it up to par with other VPNs, like city-level region selection or support for smart TVs. However, there are one or two you won't find in many other places, like the IP rotator — to my knowledge, nobody else has that except Surfshark. Here are the most important extras to know about.\nAd blocker\nNorton VPN's ad blocker can be used on its browser extension. Its mobile apps can block the trackers embedded in ads, but not the ads themselves. There's not a lot of customization potential; you can turn it on and off, and that's mainly it. The one option you have on the extension is to turn \"acceptable ads\" back on. This can help you get into sites that normally block users with adblock on, or use sites where you want to see ads to help them monetize.\n\n\n\n\n   Sam Chapman for Engadget \n \n\nDouble VPN and IP rotator\nNorton introduced these two features in 2025 as \"enhanced anonymity\" upgrades. Double VPN runs your VPN through two server locations instead of one, so you're still safe if one server breaks down. You can choose from eight pre-determined multi-hop paths with endpoints in the USA, the UK, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Japan, Germany and Taiwan.\n\n\n\n\n   Sam Chapman for Engadget \n \n\nIP rotation servers change your IP address frequently while you're connected, which makes you harder to track. Unlike Surfshark, which lets you turn this on everywhere, Norton VPN limits you to six IP rotator locations: the USA, the UK, Canada, Japan, Germany and Australia.\nConvenience features\nThe next three features were also added in the last eight months. The server location menu now puts your last five locations at the top for easy retrieval. While connected to a server, you can pause the VPN for 15, 30 or 60 minutes, after which it turns back on. Finally, the mobile apps have added a home screen widget so you can operate the VPN without opening the app.\n\n\n\n\n   Sam Chapman for Engadget \n \n\nKill switch\nA VPN kill switch cuts off your internet access if you lose your VPN connection, so any sensitive information isn't broadcast unprotected. Norton VPN's kill switch is vital, since it appears to briefly drop encryption while switching server locations. Unfortunately, it's not available on iOS.\nSplit tunneling\nThe Windows and Android apps for Norton VPN allow split tunneling, in which only certain apps go through the VPN while others connect directly. Norton uses app-based split tunneling, but if you want to protect or remove protection from specific URLs, you can use two different web browsers.\nWi-Fi security\nThis feature, which appears on NortonVPN's mobile apps only, activates whenever you connect to a Wi-Fi network. Norton VPN scans that network for common attacks launched over Wi-Fi, like DNS poisoning and SSL stripping, and sends you an alert if it detects any.\nP2P optimization\nNorton VPN has certain servers in its network configured for torrenting. You can't use it for torrenting outside those locations — if you try, the VPN will disconnect. To connect to a P2P server, just select \"P2P-optimized region\" from the server menu. You can't choose a torrenting server in a specific region; the app just selects the fastest.\nNorton VPN customer support options\nFollowing the broad trend of Norton VPN, the Windows app gets most of the love, having much more in-app support than any other platform. Mac users get a troubleshooting tab in the settings menu, with three options: go to the online help center, send a bug report or go to the community forum. iOS and Android just have a \"help and support\" button on the accounts page that sends you straight to the website.\nOn Windows, there's a separate help and support tab above the settings tab, which gives you direct links to some of the most important pages on the Norton website. It's also got links to the forum and help center. Then there's the same troubleshooting tab as the Mac app, but with more options. Windows users can reset the app to default, record a problem to get more specific help, send debug logs and run an automated \"Repair Norton\" process.\nIf you got to the website through a desktop app, it's surprisingly difficult to get to the general support page for Norton VPN — Windows links to a splintered set of FAQ pages, while Mac sends you to a Mac-specific page for the entire Norton Family. I recommend just going to support.norton.com in your browser, then clicking the Norton VPN button. At least the links in both mobile apps take you straight there.\nOnce you have gotten to the Norton VPN support page, you won't find much of use. Help articles are limited and leave some big holes. For example, all connectivity problems are limited to a page called \"Fix problem accessing the internet when connected to Norton VPN.\" The only advice for Windows, Mac and Android is to choose a different VPN protocol, and there's nothing at all for iOS.\nEven worse, whenever you use the search bar to look anything up, you're forced to watch an AI answer type itself out in real time, so links to the actual help pages are constantly jumping around as you try to click on them. It's this feature that pushes Norton's help pages from negligent to hostile.\nLive support experience\nThere are a few other ways to get support from Norton VPN. You can check in on the community forum, chat live with an agent or call their phone line. The forums are reasonably active for Windows, but pretty dead for all other platforms.\nI used live chat to ask about a problem with installing the iOS app. I managed to reach a human pretty quickly, but there were several long pauses during our conversation. Eventually, they escalated my case to a higher support team.\n\n\n\n\n   Sam Chapman for Engadget \n \n\nI assumed that this team would send me an email, per standard practice. Instead, they repeatedly tried to reach me by phone. I was not warned that they would do this, and each time, the call was flagged as spam. By the time I realized Norton was calling me, I'd already solved the problem myself. Be aware of this if you plan to contact Norton with a difficult issue.\nNorton VPN background check\nThe Norton software brand has existed in some form or another since the Norton Utilities package was developed for DOS in 1982. The brand was acquired in 1990 by Symantec, which had published its own first antivirus program the year before. Symantec began releasing Norton Antivirus in 1991, and continued distributing it until its merger with Avast in 2022. Since then, the combined company has been called Gen Digital.\nCompared to that long history, Norton VPN has only been around for a blip. It launched in 2019 as part of Symantec's bid to expand the Norton Antivirus line into a suite that could defend against more types of threats. As such, while Norton and Symantec have been involved in their share of controversies over the years, very few of them happened during Norton VPN's lifetime.\nDespite Norton's long and checkered history, checking the background of its VPN is pretty simple: nothing has gone seriously wrong yet. This VPN has problems, but they're mainly out in the open, stemming from it being a relative afterthought from a company more focused on other types of security.\nFinal verdict\nFor me to recommend a VPN, it has to stand out in a crowded field. After a week of working with Norton VPN, I have to conclude that the only way it distinguishes itself is the Norton name. For everything else it does, a competitor does it better. Surfshark scoops it on IP rotation and multihop, ExpressVPN has better protocols, NordVPN is faster and Proton VPN's ad blocker works in more places.\nOne thing I will say in Norton VPN's favor is that it's working to rectify all this. In the last year, it's added a lot of features. The problem is that most of those are options I'd have expected it to have already, such as city-level region selection and a kill switch on Mac. It's catching up, not innovating.\nIt's also nice that you can use the bundles to roll more Norton products into one subscription. However, since Norton is much more experienced at developing other sorts of security software, I'd advise going the Norton 360 route if you're interested in those other features and treating the VPN as an add-on. Norton VPN is a side dish, not an entree.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/norton-vpn-review-a-vpn-that-fails-to-meet-nortons-standards-170037086.html?src=rss",
    "full_text": "Norton VPN isn't a bad service, but it's not good enough to get ahead of its direct competitors. One word of warning about Norton VPN's mobile apps: you need an internet connection for the initial login and setup. I recommend skipping it and going with a dedicated ad blocker instead — you'll get more customization features that way. My second conclusion was that Norton VPN's servers don't leak through DNS or WebRTC while your connection remains stable. If you'd like to decide for yourself, all the plans do come with a 60-day money-back guarantee. Privacy Monitor scans for your information on data brokerage sites so you can send deletion requests, similar to Surfshark Incogni. Most of these mainly brought it up to par with other VPNs, like city-level region selection or support for smart TVs. Norton VPN's kill switch is vital, since it appears to briefly drop encryption while switching server locations. You can check in on the community forum, chat live with an agent or call their phone line.

On Wednesday, the developer said that the game will transition to PS5 and Xbox Series X/S on November 13.\nAlthough the battle royale has been playable on current-gen consoles all along, it was running as a PS4 or Xbox One game.

    "summary": "Since the original Tamagotchi landed on store shelves 28 years ago, not much has changed in the world of virtual pets. The basic gameplay remains, with players being asked to feed, groom and play with small digital creatures inside a handheld device. But new features have also been added, like Bluetooth connectivity and downloadable content (they're also a little bigger than before). This month, however, Hasbro is throwing its hat into the ring with the Nano-Mals, a $20 device that takes the standard features of a virtual pet and aims them toward a new purpose: fidget toy.\nThe first thing you’ll probably notice when you pick up one of the eight initial Nano-Mals models is how cute they all are: they’re styled after both common and uncommon animals, including two cows, two cats, a red panda, a narwhal, and a pair of unicorns.But the second thing you’ll notice is that there’s no screen to be found anywhere; instead, the sole “display” is a a light-up heart on the front of the toy that has three levels and changes color to indicate how satiated the toy is in terms of hunger, affection and play. \nHow you fulfill these needs is where the Nano-mals distinguish themselves from other virtual pets: Instead of pushing buttons and navigating through various menus, you interact instead with the various parts of the toy directly. Push down on its ear to “pet” it, flip its arms to “dance” and push its nose to “feed” it. The more you perform these actions, the more each color of the heart will fill up, eventually resulting in a rainbow kaleidoscope across the toy’s chest.\nIt’s incredibly easy to do, not just because these are simple actions, but because they’re engineered to be satisfying since it is a fidget toy. It feels good to flip the arms up and down and squish the ears. Not so much for pushing the shallow nose button though, meaning it was often the need that took the longest for me to fulfill. It just wasn’t fun to push the nose! I can only hope that future iterations improve on this.\nOnce you’ve figured out the basic functions, it becomes a game in itself to figure out the best way to hold and interact with the device. You don’t need to look at it and the entire thing can be operated with one hand, which is exactly what you want in a fidget toy. I found myself rotating it between my fingers while flipping the arms – the device also contains an accelerometer so any significant movement also counts as “play.”\nIf you have more than one Nano-mal – which is quite likely given the device’s low price – the toys will interact with each other, lighting up and talking to each other. It’s cute but also a bit unsettling, as it was very reminiscent of this year’s Black Mirror episode “Playthings” with the Nano-mals emitting mysterious bleats and chimes just like the Thronglets. Fortunately, there is an off switch, and the Nano-mals will burble happily before shutting down when you use it.\n\n\n\n\n   Kris Naudus for Engadget \n \n\nHowever, the off switch isn’t absolute as, should you press any of the buttons, the Nano-mal will still react, though maybe not effusively as if the device were powered fully on. This is a problem given that the Nano-mal is meant to be taken out and about (there’s even a clip at the top), but will likely be banned from classrooms due to the possibility of it being accidentally triggered when a kid moves their stuff. The toys can be muted by holding down the nose for a few seconds, but it only works when the device is fully powered on, and resets every time the Nano-mal is turned off and on.\nAside from that and the fact that I couldn’t remove the attachment clip, which got in the way when I was trying to spin the device in my hand, I think the Nano-mal is a solid first try at this kind of toy.

    "full_text": "The first thing you’ll probably notice when you pick up one of the eight initial Nano-Mals models is how cute they all are: they’re styled after both common and uncommon animals, including two cows, two cats, a red panda, a narwhal, and a pair of unicorns.But the second thing you’ll notice is that there’s no screen to be found anywhere; instead, the sole “display” is a a light-up heart on the front of the toy that has three levels and changes color to indicate how satiated the toy is in terms of hunger, affection and play. It’s incredibly easy to do, not just because these are simple actions, but because they’re engineered to be satisfying since it is a fidget toy. You don’t need to look at it and the entire thing can be operated with one hand, which is exactly what you want in a fidget toy. I found myself rotating it between my fingers while flipping the arms – the device also contains an accelerometer so any significant movement also counts as “play.” If you have more than one Nano-mal – which is quite likely given the device’s low price – the toys will interact with each other, lighting up and talking to each other. It’s cute but also a bit unsettling, as it was very reminiscent of this year’s Black Mirror episode “Playthings” with the Nano-mals emitting mysterious bleats and chimes just like the Thronglets. This is a problem given that the Nano-mal is meant to be taken out and about (there’s even a clip at the top), but will likely be banned from classrooms due to the possibility of it being accidentally triggered when a kid moves their stuff.

    "summary": "At WWDC 2025, Apple announced it was replacing the sequential numbering for OS versions and with year numbers. So instead of watchOS 12, I’ve spent the past two weeks with the public beta of watchOS 26. The naming scheme shift is subtle, but helpful — which is how I’d describe the upgrades the new software brings to the Apple Watch. The AI-powered Workout Buddy better contextualizes your Fitness data and an added gesture gives the watch a fun trick that’s actually helpful. Other upgrades — including better smart replies and the Liquid Glass treatment — all combine to make the watch work and look a bit better than it did before. It’s not a game-changing shift, like other OS 26 releases, but it manages to make a great watch a touch better.\nLuminous Liquid Glass\nEvery Apple operating system got the Liquid Glass treatment this year, including watchOS 26. The change is less noticeable on the Apple Watch than on the iPhone or iPad, though. You’ll notice the semi-transparent buttons and flowy movement when entering your password and opening the control center — the icons look like they’re surrounded in little drops of water, which is quite pretty. You’ll see it on the Photos watch face, too, especially if you select the “glass” color for the time readout. \nThe Liquid Glass treatment for the Photos watch face. Amy Skorheim for Engadget\nThe Smart Stack now has a liminal glow and the app icons are likewise a touch more luminous than before. The effect is subtle and nicely unifies the look of the watch and its companion iPhone. Like all design upgrades, Liquid Glass made me feel like I was using a new watch — though, like everything, the novelty wore off after a week or two.\nRevamped Workout app combines AI stats with a DJ\nIn addition to the Buddy, the Workout app has a new look with icons in each of the four corners of the screen that give you easier access to adjust your data view, play music, set goals and tweak Buddy settings. My favorite new feature is in the music menu and it’s limited to Apple Music for now. If you tap the music icon, you have the option to auto-play music. From there, you can also select “Picked for you” or “Choose media.” The former will select music that matches the type of workout you’re doing and what you like to listen to. As someone who gets derailed from pretty much all my tasks when I have to interact with my phone, I appreciate anything that can make decisions for me and prevent me from reaching for it.\nI was presented with peppy beats that matched the cadence of my run, from bands and artists that were familiar as well as new-to-me selections that fit my tastes. Unfortunately, it didn’t always work correctly. Sometimes I’d get no music, other times the music would play but the Workout Buddy would fall silent. I realize I’m testing a public beta of watchOS 26, so I’m holding out hope the feature will work at launch. Because when it worked, it was glorious.\nThe new Workout app layout. Amy Skorheim for Engadget\nThe new Workout Buddy is probably the biggest AI play in watchOS 26. It uses historical and real-time data collected by your watch to give you a window into how you’re performing at the beginning, end and throughout a workout. It works for walking, running, cycling and other workouts but requires headphones and a nearby Apple Intelligence-compatible iPhone. That gave me pause. I hate carrying stuff and/or sticking things in my ears when I run. But after acquiring some open earbuds and digging out my old Spibelt, I made it work.\nThere are three voices to choose from as of this writing, a bright feminine option, a British male-sounding one and another female-presenting version with a lower register. These were built on vocal data from Fitness+ trainers and have an authentic sound to them. At the start of a workout, you’ll get a brief pep talk along with some recent milestones. My pre-game walking and running talks included references to the day of the week, my location and accumulated fitness data. For example, “Way to get out there on a Wednesday morning walk in Albuquerque. So far this week, you’ve done three walking workouts. Let’s get in some steps!”\nDepending on the type of exercise, you can set target ranges for cadence, heart rate, speed, distance, power (cycling), time and others. During a workout, the AI will let you know if you’re at, below or above those levels. The first time I tried Workout Buddy, my run was quite lonely. I didn’t realize I had to turn on the Buddy, as well as the various goal metrics within the Workout app. I did that and, on my next run, the AI delivered cadence and heart rate updates, and let me know when I hit milestones like distance and duration.\nAt the end of a workout, you’ll see a thinking animation as the AI assembles a summary. It’ll recap data like your pace, distance, average and peak heart rate, as well as progress on your Activity rings. It’ll also point out comparisons or cumulative milestones you may have hit. For example, after a longer walk, it told me that I’d just burned the most calories on a walk so far. Another day, it told me I’d walked ten miles so far this week. It closes the update by encouraging you to take the energy into the rest of your day or something similarly positive but measured.\nThat’s a big improvement over the first few times I used the feature. My first few pep talks were cloying, telling me something along the lines of “It’s not easy to get out there early in the morning!” and “Your effort is inspiring!\" After I stopped a run early to fuss with settings, it told me I did a “Great job!” on a three-minute run. Thankfully, Apple appears to be tweaking the Buddy behind the scenes, calibrating the AI’s “personality.” Recent pep talks have become noticeably less sycophantic and therefore more enjoyable. I imagine the Buddy will only continue to evolve even more from here.\nThe Workout Buddy is not a coach\nThe Workout Buddy is a motivational experience that provides personalized insights you can use to gauge your performance. But I just finished trying out Samsung’s AI running coach on the Galaxy Watch and couldn’t help comparing the two. That coach pushed me to run five kilometers for the first time in my life. The Buddy made me feel like I’d accomplished something special just by taking my dog on a stroll. Both have their place, but I’d say Apple’s version is probably best for those who already know what their goals are and what they need to do to hit them. Samsung’s version may be better for beginners who want some help shaping their fitness journey.\nIn addition to the Buddy, the Workout app has a new look with icons in each of the four corners of the screen that give you easier access to adjust your data view, play music, set goals and tweak Buddy settings. My favorite new feature is in the music menu and it’s limited to Apple Music for now. If you tap the music icon, you have the option to auto-play music. From there, you can also select “Picked for you” or “Choose media.” The former will select music that matches the type of workout you’re doing and what you like to listen to. As someone who gets derailed from pretty much all my tasks when I have to interact with my phone, I appreciate anything that can make decisions for me and prevent me from reaching for it.\nI was presented with peppy beats that matched the cadence of my run, from bands and artists that were familiar as well as new-to-me selections that fit my tastes. Unfortunately, it didn’t always work correctly. Sometimes I’d get no music, other times the music would play but the Workout Buddy would fall silent. I realize I’m testing a public beta of watchOS 26, so I’m holding out hope the feature will work at launch. Because when it worked, it was glorious.\nMore hands-free fun with wrist flick\nI love the double tap gesture Apple introduced with the Apple Watch Series 9 — it’s a pleasure to stop timers, start auto-detected workouts and answer calls without getting my other hand involved. But it took some practice before I could reliably get the watch to recognize the gesture. (The trick is raising your wrist in an exaggerated checking-the-time motion then quickly, but not too quickly, tapping your thumb and finger together twice.)\nLuckily, the new Wrist Flick motion introduced in watchOS 26 takes practically no effort to get right. It involves quickly turning the back of your wrist away from you and back up again. Doing that can silence a call, stop a ringing timer, dismiss notifications and return you to the watch face from any app you open. It also makes those irritating helpful “Time to stand!” reminders go away. The wrist flick doesn’t clear alerts, just dismisses them — so the red indicator dot disappears, but the notification remains and you can see it if you swipe down. Just note that it’s only available to Apple Watch Series 9, 10 and the Ultra 2.\nAmy Skorheim for Engadget\nWrist flick is a great feature — though it's important to note that Android wearables since WearOS 2 had a similar feature for a while now. And I’d like to see Apple adopt more hands-free interactions like this. Apple already has many gesture-based controls as part of its existing AssistiveTouch feature. Actions like fist clenches, wrist tilts and single or double taps can control most of the navigation on the watch. Unfortunately, turning on AssistiveTouch turns off the universal double tap feature. I’d be interested in seeing something that splits the difference. Perhaps four or five gestures for basic functions that can be used in conjunction with screen input.\nSmarter replies could make Messages a usable watch app\nThe Apple Watch is great for reading texts, but replying is awkward. That tiny keyboard is an interface for ants — even talk-to-text input is inefficient as it’s tough to correct mistakes. Smart Replies are little canned responses that appear as suggestions below the reply field. Those aren’t new, but now Series 9 watches and later will use an improved on-device language model to come up with relevant bits of text you can send with a tap.\nIn addition to the choices that are always offered — Okay, Yes, No, Thank you and Can I call you later? — I saw things like “Ok, let me know” and “That’s so sweet!” both of which applied to their respective conversations. I wasn’t always given Smart Reply suggestions, and some of them weren’t very relevant, but again, it’s a great feature that will save time when it works.\nAnother Messages update is a carryover from iOS 26 (and borrowed from countless other messaging apps). You can now set custom backgrounds for each of your (Apple-only) contacts. Just note that whatever you set will be seen by all participants in the conversation, once they update to iOS 26. On your watch, the photo, gradient or pattern you pick carries over to your conversations. Not only does it look nice, I find backgrounds help me to not accidentally text my mom something I meant to send to my sister.\nBackgrounds are now available in Messages. Amy Skorheim for Engadget\nNotes have arrived\nThe Notes app is now on Apple Watch. I honestly hadn’t noticed the lack before this — I know there are plenty of Notes enthusiasts out there, but in my world, Alexa handles all reminder and shopping list duties. Still, I can see how the new integration could come in handy. After creating a simple shopping checklist in the iOS Notes app, I opened the list on my watch while I was shopping and found it far easier to check things off on my wrist than dragging out my phone every time I stuck something in my cart.\nI’m curious to see whether Apple’s improved prediction algorithms for the new OS will eventually add Notes to my Smart Stack suggestions after I open the Notes app a few times at the grocery store. As it stands now, the Notes widget will pop up first in the Smart Stack if that’s the last app you used.\nThe rest of the new stuff\nFace Gallery\nThe iPhone Watch app has a new look and now organizes watch faces by category instead of by name. Groupings include New, Clean, Data-rich, Photos and Health and Fitness, among others. It’s certainly an improvement, but one that makes you wonder why it wasn’t always like this.\nThe Watch Face gallery is categorized now.Amy Skorheim for Engadget\nAdaptive sound\nAnother nice-but-obvious update adjusts the volume of pings and beeps to fit the environment — quieter in a noiseless office and louder at a raucous BBQ. I set a timer to go off when I was quietly working at my desk and then again with loud music playing and I couldn’t really tell the difference. But that’s a hard metric for the humble human ear to judge. Again, this is a feature reserved for Series 9 models and later.\nSmart Stack\nThe Smart Stack will now add a small prompt to your watch face when it detects certain situations. For example, if you open the camera app on your phone, a small camera icon appears at the bottom of your watch screen, as a suggestion to open the remote shutter. Apple gives other examples, such as showing the workout icon when you arrive at your usual pilates studio or the Backtrack navigation feature when you journey away from cellular connectivity.\nI didn’t see the prompt very often, but I did notice that the Smart Stack rearranged itself according to my habits — such as putting the medication widget at the top of the stack right around the time it was time to take my prescription, or shuffling Shazam to the top when it hears music playing.\nSiri is still Siri\nComing fresh off of reviewing the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8, I can’t help but notice a stark difference between that wearable’s fully integrated, AI-powered Gemini and Apple’s same-old Siri. Gemini on the Samsung watch helped me find new stuff in my city, performed convoluted tasks and answered some pretty esoteric questions. I use Siri on my watch to reliably set timers, text people and add events to my calendar. But it’s not quite on the level of Gemini’s contextually-aware, generative capabilities that can interact with multiple apps. Asking something like “Where should I have lunch?” gave me a list of businesses with lunch in the name followed by Siri asking me: “Which one?” Not sure what that meant. Gemini, on the other hand, gave me local and relevant ideas for places I’d actually want to eat.\nEven before AI swallowed everyone’s mind, I had a soft spot for digital assistants. When Alexa sings the “You’re very, very, oh so very welcome” song, I get a dopey smile on my face. I’ve tried to love Siri, but I get frustrated by being misunderstood, misdirected, misheard and flat-out ignored. I know Apple doesn’t like to release new tech until it’s fully up to snuff, and I’m looking forward to seeing what finally happens with new Siri. But for now, the disparity shows.\nWrap-up\nThe changes watchOS 26 brings to the Apple Watch are perhaps not as grand as those for other Apple devices. Liquid Glass here isn’t as all-encompassing as it is on the iPhone. The new watch features don’t make the wearable finally realize its full potential like iPad OS 26 does for the tablet. And there isn’t one major feature upgrade that transforms the watch experience, like macOS 26 does with Spotlight on Macs.\nBut the updates do push the experience of using the watch forward. Liquid Glass is pretty and nicely ties the wearable with its companion devices. The Workout app, which was already good at tracking fitness metrics, is even better with the Workout Buddy, providing stat summaries and automated playlists. Improved smart replies for Messages and the addition of the Notes app fix two of the watch’s previous shortcomings. And the wrist flick adds another option for hands-free interaction and — I hope — is a precursor to more such utility. I’m still holding out hope for an improved, personable and helpful Siri once Apple is ready, but for now, these are all welcome upgrades for what’s already the industry’s best overall smartwatch.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wearables/watchos-26-preview-its-the-little-things-140035949.html?src=rss",

If there’s anything to give you pause, it’s that we might be getting the AirPods Pro 3 sooner rather than later. But if that’s the case, you can be confident you’ll pay a lot more than $169 for the privilege. The AirPods 4 (without ANC) are down to $99. They fit and sound better than any non-Pro AirPods before them, and inherit some previously Pro-only features thanks to the H2 chip.

    "summary": "I’m a longtime lover of pen and paper, so E Ink tablets have been intriguing to me ever since they started becoming more widely available. After having hundreds of half-filled notebooks over the years, I, at some point, turned to digital tools instead because it was just easier to store everything on my phone or laptop so I always had my most important information at my fingertips.E-Ink tablets seem to provide the best of both worlds: the tactile satisfaction of regular notebooks with many of the conveniences found in digital tools, plus easy-on-the-eyes E-Ink screens. These devices have come a long way in recent years — now you can find them in multiple sizes, some have color E Ink screens and others double as full-blow ereaders with access to ebook stores and your local library’s offerings. I’ve tested out close to a dozen E Ink tablets over the past few years to see how well they work, how convenient they really are and which are the best tablets using E Ink screens available today.\nTable of contents\n\nBest E Ink tablets for 2025\nAre E Ink tablets worth it?\nWhat to look for in an E Ink tablet\nOther E Ink tablets we've tested\n\nBest E Ink tablets for 2025\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAre E Ink tablets worth it?\nAn E Ink tablet will be a worthwhile purchase to a very select group of people. If you prefer the look and feel of an e paper display to LCD panels found on traditional tablets, it makes a lot of sense. They’re also good options for those who want a more paper-like writing experience (although you can get that kind of functionality on a regular tablet with the right screen protector) or a more distraction-free device overall. \nThe final note is key here. Many E Ink tablets don’t run on the same operating systems as regular tablets, so you’re automatically going to be limited in what you can do. And even with those that do allow you to download traditional apps like Chrome, Instagram and Facebook, E Ink tablets are not designed to give you the best casual-browsing experience. This is mostly due to the nature of E Ink displays, which have noticeable refreshes, a lack of vibrant colors and lower picture quality than the panels you’ll find on even the cheapest iPad.\nArguably the biggest reason why you wouldn’t want to go with an iPad (all models of which support stylus input, a plethora of reading apps, etc) is because it’s much easier to get distracted by email, social media and other Internet-related temptations.\nWhat to look for in an E Ink tablet\nWriting and latency\nArguably the most important thing to consider when looking for an E Ink tablet is the writing experience. How good it is will depend a lot on the display’s refresh rate (does it refresh after every time you put pen to “paper,” or at a different regular interval) and the stylus’ latency. Most of the tablets I’ve tested have little to no latency, but some are certainly better than others. Finally, you should double check before buying that your preferred E Ink tablet comes with a stylus, or if you need to purchase one separately.\nReading\nHow much will you be reading books, documents and other things on this tablet? E Ink tablets come in many sizes, but most of them tend to be larger than your standard e-reader because it makes writing much easier. Having a larger display isn’t a bad thing, but it might make holding it for long periods slightly more uncomfortable. (Most e-readers are roughly the size of a paperback book, giving you a similar feeling to analog reading).\nThe supported file types for e-books can also make a big difference. It’s hard to make a blanket statement here because this varies so much among E Ink tablets. The TL;DR is that you’ll have a much better reading experience if you go with one made by a company that already has a history in e-book sales (i.e. Amazon or Kobo). All of the titles you bought via the Kindle or Kobo store should automatically be available to you on your Kindle or Kobo E Ink tablet.\nAlso with Kindle titles, specifically, since they are protected by DRM, it’s not necessarily the best idea to try to bring those titles over to a third-party device. Unless the tablet runs an operating system like Android that supports downloads for apps like Kindle and Kobo, you’ll be limited to supported file types, like ePUB, PDF, MOBI, JPEG, PNG and others.\nSearch functionality\nMost E Ink tablets have some on-device search features, but they can vary widely between models. You’ll want to consider how important it is to you to be able to search through all your handwritten notes and markups. I noticed in my testing that Amazon’s and Kobo’s E Ink tablets made it easy to refer back to notes made in books and files because they automatically save to the specific pages on which you took notes, made highlights and more.\nSearching is less standardized on E Ink tablets that have different supported file types, but their features can be quite powerful in their own right. For example, a few devices I tested supported text search in handwritten notes along with handwriting recognition, the latter of which allows you to translate your scribbles into typed text.\nSharing and connectivity\nWhile we established that E Ink tablets can be great distraction-free devices, most manufacturers understand that your notes and doodles aren’t created in a vacuum. You may want to access them elsewhere, and that requires some form of connectivity. All of the E Ink tablets I tried have Wi-Fi support, and some support cloud syncing, companion mobile apps and the ability to export notes via email so you can access them elsewhere.\nNone of them, however, integrate directly with a digital note taking system like Evernote or OneNote, so these devices will always be somewhat supplementary if you use apps like that, too. I’d argue that, if you already lean heavily on apps like OneNote, a standard tablet with a stylus and screen protector might be the best way to go. Ultimately, you should think about what you will want to do with the documents you’ll interact with on your E Ink tablet after the tablet portion is done.\nPrice\nE Ink tablets aren’t known for being cheap. They generally fall into the $300-$800 price range, which is what you can expect to pay for a solid regular tablet, too. A key factor in price is size: cheaper devices with E Ink displays are likely to have smaller screens, and stylus support isn’t as much of a given. Also, those types of devices are generally considered e-readers because of their size and may not be the best for note-taking, doodling and the like.\nE Ink tablets have gone up in price recently. Supernote and Onyx Boox increased prices, as did reMarkable. The former said it was due to \"increased costs,” and a reMarkable representative confirmed this to Engadget and provided the following statement: \"We regularly review our pricing based on market conditions and operational costs. We've communicated an upcoming adjustment for the US market effective in May to provide transparency to our customers. Multiple factors influence our pricing decisions, including supply chain dynamics and overall operational costs in specific markets.”\nAs a result, the reMarkable Paper Pro jumped from $579 to $629 (that's for the bundle with the standard Marker and no Folio). This isn't great, considering the Paper Pro was already on the expensive side of the spectrum for E Ink tablets. It's also worth noting that Supernote and Onyx Boox have raised prices in the past few months as well.\nOther E Ink tablets we've tested\nLenovo Smart Paper\nLenovo made a solid E Ink tablet in the Smart Paper, but it's too pricey and too married to the company's companion cloud service to warrant a spot on our top picks list. The hardware is great, but the software isn't as flexible as those of competitors like the reMarkable 2. It has good Google Drive integration, but you must pair it with Lenovo's cloud service to really get the most use out of it — and in the UK, the service costs £9 per month for three months, which is quite expensive.\nOnyx Boox Tab Ultra\nThe Boox Tab Ultra has a lot of the same features we like in the Note Air 2 Plus, but it’s designed to be a true, all-purpose tablet with an E Ink screen. Running Android 11 and compatible with a magnetic keyboard case, you can use it like a standard 2-in-1 laptop, albeit a low-powered one. You can browse the web, check email and even watch YouTube videos on this thing — but that doesn’t mean you should. A standard 2-in-1 laptop with a more responsive screen and better overall performance would be a better fit for most people who even have the slightest desire to have an all-in-one device. Like the rest of Onyx’s devices, the Tab Ultra is specifically for those who put reading and eye comfort above all else.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/best-e-ink-tablet-130037939.html?src=rss",

Hats off to reMarkable for making an E Ink tablet that feels right at home with all of your other fancy gadgets. I observed basically no lag between my pressing down onto the reMarkable 2’s screen and lines showing up. I noticed a barely perceptible latency and good pressure sensitivity, which is most obvious using the fountain pen. The tap-to-convert feature almost always correctly turned my weird printing-and-cursive-hybrid handwriting into type, and uploading notebooks to Dropbox or Google Drive took mere seconds. Most of the tablets I’ve tested have little to no latency, but some are certainly better than others.

However, the company is adding a few new tools and it drastically reduced the size of the wireless subwoofer that comes in the box. Samsung does have one new model for 2025, the QS700F, that’s designed to sit on a table or automatically adjust to being mounted flat on a wall. Details are scarce on that soundbar for now and I anticipate a full spec sheet when the company is really to sell it.\nOf the big three TV companies, Sony is the only one that didn’t announce any home theater gear at CES. The company has decided to focus mainly on its automotive efforts at the show recently, leaving TV and audio announcements for later in the year. The company debuted multiple soundbar options in 2024 and a four-speaker setup for the living room in the Bravia Quad. That said, it wouldn’t surprise me if Sony released new soundbars later in the year since its most recent models were only announced last April.\nOne company I would keep an eye on is Sennheiser. The original Ambeo model is nearly six years old and could use a refresh. The company has added medium and mini options to the Ambeo lineup since then, but it would be nice to see a refined version of the largest model too. The original Ambeo soundbar is huge, so no matter how good it sounds, it will always be a tough sell for some people.\nAlthough I think it’s less likely, it’s also possible that Sonos has new soundbars this year. While the company’s next device will likely be the rumored set-top streaming box, the Sound Motion tech inside the Arc Ultra would offer a big improvement to bass performance in compact models like the Beam and Ray. The company may bring Sound Motion to standalone speakers first, but it’s destined for those smaller soundbars eventually.\nThe best soundbars for 2025\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nWhat to look for in a soundbar\nFeatures\nWhen it comes to features, the more you pay the more you're going to get in your new audio system. Most affordable options ($150 or less) will improve your television's audio quality, but that's about it. Step into the $300 to $400 range and you'll find all-in-one soundbars with things like built-in voice control, wireless connectivity, Google Chromecast, AirPlay 2 and even Android TV. They're all helpful when you want to avoid looking for the remote control, but the best playback quality is usually only in the top tier and the formats those premium soundbar systems support. I’m talking about things like Dolby Atmos, DTS:X and other high-resolution audio standards — essentials if you’re building a truly cinematic home entertainment setup. And not all Atmos soundbars are equal, so you'll need to look at the finer details carefully before you break into the savings account. If you're looking for one of the best Dolby Atmos soundbars, size, channels and subwoofer options will be important factors to consider. Some models even include a dedicated subwoofer to enhance bass performance, bringing an extra punch to action scenes and soundtracks.\nPorts\n\n\n\n\nThis is a big one. A lot of the more affordable soundbars are limited when it comes to connectivity options. They either offer an optical port or one HDMI jack and, if you're lucky, both. Things get slightly better in the mid-range section, but that's not always the case. The Sonos Beam, for example, is $449, but only has a single HDMI port. Even at the higher-end, the $899 Sonos Arc still only has one HDMI port. If you plan to connect multiple devices like a set-top box, gaming laptop or console directly to your soundbar for the best audio experience, you’ll want an option with at least two HDMI (eARC) inputs. HDMI connections are critical for supporting Dolby Atmos and Dolby Digital audio formats, as well as high-res passthrough for HDR and 8K/4K content.\nChannels\nAnother big thing you’ll want to pay attention to when looking for the best soundbar is channels. That’s the 2.1, 7.1.2 or other decimal number that companies include in product descriptions. The first figure corresponds to the number of channels. A two would just be left and right while a more robust Atmos system, especially one with rear surround speakers, could be five or seven (left, right, center and upward). The second number refers to the dedicated subwoofer, so if your new soundbar comes with one or has them built in, you’ll see one here. The third numeral is up-firing speakers, important for the immersive effect of Dolby Atmos. Not all Atmos-enabled units have them, but if they do, the third number will tell you how many are in play and how they contribute to the overall soundstage.\nWireless\n\n\n\n\nMost soundbars these days offer either Bluetooth, Wi-Fi or both. When it comes to Wi-Fi, that connectivity affords you luxuries like voice control (either built-in or with a separate device), Chromecast, Spotify Connect and AirPlay 2. Depending on your preferences, you might be able to live without some of these. For me, AirPlay 2 and Chromecast are essentials, but the rest I can live without. Those two give me the ability to beam music and podcasts from my go-to apps without having to settle for — or struggle with — a Bluetooth connection. For instance, Sonos speakers often offer seamless integration with iOS devices, making it easy to connect and stream music wirelessly. If you’re looking for a wireless speaker that can enhance your TV setup while also offering flexibility for audio throughout the house, it's worth considering a multi-room system.\nSize\nThis one might seem obvious but humor me for a minute. Nothing is more soul-crushing than getting a pricey soundbar in your living room only to discover you have to rearrange everything to find a spot for it. This was my plight when the Sennheiser Ambeo Soundbar arrived at my door. Yes, that speaker is absurdly large (and heavy), and most soundbars aren't nearly as big. I learned a valuable lesson: Make sure the space where you want to put a soundbar will accommodate the thing you're about to spend hundreds (if not thousands) of dollars on.\nBasically, it all comes down to the TV you have (or are planning to get) and what the primary goal is for your living-room audio. Is it ease of use? Do you want the best possible sound from a single speaker or speaker/sub combo? Do you just want to be able to actually hear your TV better? Or do you want a full home entertainment experience with crisp vocals, thunderous deep bass, and immersive surround system audio?\nBy paying attention to each of those areas, you should have a good idea of what to look for in a soundbar, soundbar/subwoofer combo, Dolby Digital system or a more robust setup. With that said, we've put numerous products through their paces at Engadget and have a few favorites for best soundbar at various price points to get you started.\nOther soundbars we tested\nSony Bravia Theater Bar 6\nThere’s a lot to like about the Bravia Theater Bar 6, Sony’s new midrange option in its soundbar lineup. Sound quality is the speaker’s best attribute, even though it’s limited by its 3.1.2-channel configuration. The biggest two issues with this model are the lack of Wi-Fi connectivity — which means no AirPlay, Chromecast or Spotify Connect — and the need to use your computer and a thumb drive to install firmware updates. Neither of those should be things you have to consider on a $650 soundbar in 2025.\nSonos Arc\nThere’s no doubt that the Arc is Sonos’ best-sounding soundbar, but it’s also the company’s most expensive. With a new model based on the Arc rumored to be on the way, it’s difficult to recommend this product over the likes of Samsung and Sony. The Arc works well as both a soundbar and a speaker, and the device will fit in nicely with other Sonos gear you might already have for a multiroom setup. It only has one HDMI port though, where much of the competition allows you to connect streaming and gaming devices directly to their soundbars.\nSennheiser Ambeo Soundbar Plus\nI don’t think Sennheiser’s medium-sized model offers enough to stand out from the more powerful Ambeo Soundbar Max or the Ambeo Soundbar Mini. The Mini is more affordable and does a solid job with immersive audio in its own right. Like the rest of the Ambeo lineup, there’s no option for satellite speakers as you can only add a subwoofer to the soundbars. However, the Ambeo Soundbar Plus does have RCA input, so you can use it with a turntable if you’re into vinyl.\nBest soundbar FAQs\nIs a soundbar better than speakers?\nIt really depends on what you’re after. A soundbar is definitely a simpler, more compact solution compared to a full speaker setup. If you want better sound than your TV’s built-in setup but don’t want to deal with multiple speakers and wires everywhere, a soundbar is probably the way to go. Some soundbars can even deliver impressive surround sound effects, thanks to features like Dolby Atmos and virtual audio technology. \nHowever, if you’re an audiophile or want true surround sound for an at-home theater experience, a multi-speaker setup with a receiver, surround speakers and subwoofer will give you a richer soundstage and more control over your experience.\nWhat connection do I need for a soundbar?\nMost modern soundbars connect to your TV via HDMI ARC or eARC, which is the easiest and best option for achieving high-quality audio. If your TV supports this, all you need is an HDMI cable, and you’ll get not only great sound but also some extra features like controlling the soundbar with your TV remote. \nIf HDMI ARC isn’t an option on your TV, you can use an optical cable, which also delivers solid audio quality. Some soundbars even offer Bluetooth or Wi-Fi connections for streaming music, and a few still have a 3.5mm aux jack for connecting to older devices. \nDo all soundbars come with subwoofers?\nNot all soundbars come with subwoofers, but many do or at least offer one as an optional add-on that you can purchase separately. A subwoofer is what gives you that deep, booming bass, so if you like action movies or want a fuller sound for music, having one can make a big difference. Some soundbars have a built-in subwoofer, but these generally don’t provide the same punch as a separate one. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/speakers/best-soundbars-143041791.html?src=rss",
    "full_text": "In 2025, there’s a soundbar for every kind of home entertainment setup — from compact all-in-one units to full surround systems with subwoofers and rear speakers. LG decided to carry over its most premium soundbars from 2024, but it will add the compact S20A this year. Details are scarce on that soundbar for now and I anticipate a full spec sheet when the company is really to sell it. That said, it wouldn’t surprise me if Sony released new soundbars later in the year since its most recent models were only announced last April. The company may bring Sound Motion to standalone speakers first, but it’s destined for those smaller soundbars eventually. The expanded speech enhancement feature comes with a degree of customization and there are now two options for room calibration. However, you’ll still get a virtualized 7.1.4-channel speaker setup that works well for movies and music. Some soundbars can even deliver impressive surround sound effects, thanks to features like Dolby Atmos and virtual audio technology. Most modern soundbars connect to your TV via HDMI ARC or eARC, which is the easiest and best option for achieving high-quality audio.
