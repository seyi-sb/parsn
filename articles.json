    "full_text": "Microsoft is ending support for Windows 11 SE next year, five years after it launched the operating system on low-cost laptops that were designed to compete with Google Chromebooks. Windows 11 SE was only available on devices for education customers, such as schools, and it was supposed to convince them not to switch to Chrome OS. ‚ÄúSupport for Windows 11 SE ‚Äî including software updates, technical assistance, and security fixes ‚Äî will end in October 2026,‚Äú says Microsoft in an updated support article spotted by Dr.Windows. ‚ÄúWhile your device will continue to work, we recommend transitioning to a device that supports another edition of Windows 11 to ensure continued support and security.‚Äù Microsoft won‚Äôt release its upcoming 25H2 update for Windows 11 SE, which means that devices will remain on 24H2 until support ends next year. Microsoft has tried and failed to compete with Chrome OS many times over the years. The software maker previously created an S Mode that locked Windows 10 down to apps from the Microsoft Store, but it ended up frustrating users when there weren‚Äôt enough apps in the Store. Windows 11 SE took a similar approach by encouraging schools to use Progressive Web Apps (PWA) instead of traditional win32 apps. IT admins had to create exceptions for devices to run win32 apps, and Microsoft maintained a strict list of allowed apps for Windows 11 SE. Microsoft‚Äôs decision to kill off Windows 11 SE comes a year after Gartner warned that Chromebooks were ‚Äúlosing market share due to their limited customer base and inferior build quality.‚Äù Chromebook shipments have been in decline since 2022, and the PC refresh cycle this year seems to be largely focused on Windows 11 upgrades rather than an exodus to Chrome OS."

We even know what one of the phones looks like, thanks to the official image up above. But beyond the few tidbits Google has shared officially, there‚Äôs an awful lot more we think [‚Ä¶]",
    "full_text": "But before you get too excited, know that there are some downsides. Android Headlines reports that it only comes in two variants, but unlike last year those aren‚Äôt black and white. The first is that Android Authority reported in June that Google is preparing an ecosystem of magnetic Qi2 accessories under the ‚ÄúPixelsnap‚Äù brand, including two chargers and a stand. But Google could also be making space for the magnets required to enable Qi2 support. Android Authority reports that Google is developing several new AI imaging features, though some may be for next year‚Äôs Pixel 11. The same site has separately reported that the Pixel 10 will have a new virtual assistant called ‚ÄúPixel Sense,‚Äù once rumored to be called ‚ÄúPixie.‚Äù Pixel Sense will use information from other Google apps to complete tasks across your phone, make predictive suggestions to help you before you ask, and better learn your tastes from all that data. These AI features should arrive alongside Android updates we‚Äôve known about since Google I/O, like the big Material 3 Expressive redesign and a desktop mode based on Samsung‚Äôs DeX. The 10 Pro XL may see a price bump from $1,099 to $1,199, but that‚Äôs only because Google has scrapped the phone‚Äôs 128GB option, starting at 256GB instead ‚Äî and matching the 9 Pro XL‚Äôs pricing at that and higher storage tiers. Meanwhile, the 10 Pro Fold may stick with a $1,799 starting price for 256GB of storage, but the leak suggests Google is adding a new 1TB option at $2,149. Update, August 1st: Added leaks of a magnetic charging puck and US prices."

    "summary": "In just under two months, assuming Apple sticks to its usual schedule, we'll finally put our eyes on the newest collections of smartphones: the iPhone 17 lineup. We already got a glimpse of what's coming with iOS 26 during the June WWDC event, but we're still in the dark about what the new iPhones will look like, as well as what new features they'll offer. However, there have been several leaks and rumors about the hardware side ahead of the phones' official introduction. Here's what we're expecting and what we can reasonably assume we'll get from Cupertino in September.\nWhat are the latest iPhone 17 rumors and reports?\nNot all iPhone rumors are created equal, and all should be taken with a grain of salt. As July turns to August, we've gotten \"leaked\" colors and a glimpse of a purported iPhone 17 \"spotted in the wild.\" Let's get into it below.\nI just spotted a test development iPhone in the wild ü§©ü§©ü§© pic.twitter.com/iS3PtKWqxJ‚Äî Fox Pupy ü¶äüß° (@Skyfops) July 28, 2025\n\nThe pics, highlighted on MacRumors, show a black cased iPhone (17?) with the sort of extended top rear \"camera island\" rumored to be coming to the new Pro iPhones. Is it the real deal? The dual angles lend a degree of credibility in a social media landscape increasingly polluted with AI-enhanced fakes, but your guess is as good as ours.¬†¬†\nBut that's not the only rumor. A \"tipster\" contacted MacRumors to allege three new iPhone Pro camera features: an upgraded telephoto lens with up to 8x optical zoom (up from the current 5x); an all-new pro camera app from Apple for photos and videos; and an additional Camera Control button on the top edge of the phone. That last one seems especially unbelievable, as it would be the third new button added to new iPhones in as many years. Do we really need two dedicated camera keys, in addition to the Action Button?¬†\nMeanwhile, on July 30, Tom's Guide highlighted an X post from Sonny Dickson ‚Äî a longtime and generally reliable leaker of unreleased iPhone information ‚Äî showing \"dummy\" iPhone 17 models in the new colors he had leaked earlier in the month (see below). While these are literally just mock-ups ‚Äî not real, leaked iPhones ‚Äî it's interesting to see how the design and color rumors translate into a real-world look and feel. Of course, we won't know if these colors are legit until the iPhone event this fall.\nFirst look at iPhone 17 color dummies, The new orange really stands out this year ‚Äî definitely a bold addition. Thoughts? pic.twitter.com/M0gB6NSglI‚Äî Sonny Dickson (@SonnyDickson) July 29, 2025\n\nWhen will the iPhone 17 series be announced?\nMost years, the flagship smartphones are introduced in September. It's a little early to have the specific dates; some years, Apple only gives a week or two of lead time between sending invites and hosting the event. But years of past precedent show that sometime in September should be when the 17 models make their debut. This family of smartphones may be the last to follow that trend, however. There have been hints that the introduction of the iPhone 18 collection in 2026 will be split into a pro-tier announcement in the fall and a standard model announcement the following spring.\nWhat will the new iPhone 17 lineup include?\nDesign leaks suggest that Apple is building an ultra-thin smartphone, likely to be named the iPhone 17 Air to match Apple's ultralight laptop designation. Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, often a solid source of advanced intel about Apple, reported in January that the iPhone 17 Air will be equipped with a basic A19 chip and will only have a single camera lens. It may also use Apple's new in-house modem, which was introduced in February on the iPhone 16e. More details about this development may leak ahead of September, but that's what we know for now.\nAn investor note from Apple analyst Jeff Pu indicated that the Air will have a titanium frame. If his reports are accurate, the lightweight smartphone will be the only entry in the iPhone 17 lineup to use that metal; the iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone 17 Pro Max are expected to be made of aluminum, which is oddly a lighter material than titanium. Other speculation had suggested that the Air would use a blend of aluminum and titanium, so the exact materials may not be known until the official announcement.\nEach new roster includes a base model, but over the years, Apple shakes up the variety of phones it offers. Most likely there will be an iPhone 17 and an iPhone 17 Pro. Apple has also committed to the size matters philosophy, and has been building an iPhone Pro Max option with an even bigger screen and better battery life; the 17 roster will almost certainly have one as well.¬†\nThe iPhone 17 Air seems primed to take the place of a potential iPhone 17 Plus. Since the iPhone 16e was only just introduced in February at a surprisingly high price point, it seems unlikely that there will be a new addition to that lower end of the spectrum, the models that were previously called SE.¬†\nAt the very least, it sounds like the iPhone 17 Air won't take away the charging port and rely only on wireless connectivity. Bloomberg said that while Apple had investigated making the iPhone 17 Air without a single port, the company (fortunately) changed plans. He also says that the rumored phone will have a 6.6-inch screen and include the Dynamic Island and Camera Control button. Finally, the price is rumored at $900 ‚Äî likely more than the standard iPhone 17 but less than the Pro.\nWe've also gotten what seems to be a reliable look at what the color lineup will be for the new smartphones. Macworld reported that the iPhone 17 will be available in black, white, steel gray, green, purple and light blue. The iPhone 17 Air will reportedly have four color options: black, white, light blue and light gold. While the Air colors will be less saturated, the visuals for the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max will go bold. The options for the Pro models are expected to be black, white, gray, dark blue and orange.\nWhat will iOS 26 be like?\nApple upended its numbering conventions with WWDC 2025, and will match the name of each new operating system to the year it's released. So when the next wave of iPhones hits, they'll be running on iOS 26.\nOn the design side, the smartphone OS introduced during the big developer showcase took a contentious approach dubbed Liquid Glass. Apple has been scaling down the amount of transparency effects in the subsequent beta tests of iOS 26, but it will still have a glass-like visual.\nThe feature list includes big and small updates. On the more impactful side, the Phone and Photos apps have been redesigned. There will be several features leveraging artificial intelligence, such as live translation capabilities coming to Phone, FaceTime and Messages. Apple is also currently testing a sensitive content warning for child accounts that will freeze FaceTime video if nudity is detected by on-device machine learning tools. And the company is also launching Visual Intelligence, which will use AI to search for elements in an image.\niOS 26 also has a litany of minor, quality of life improvements. Group texts are getting support for polls. And for the slow risers out there, iOS 26 will finally let you escape the tyranny of the nine minute snooze alarm.¬†\nThe next iOS is now available as a public beta. Here are our initial impressions of the Liquid Glass design and other new features. iOS 26 is compatible with all models back through iPhone 11.\nUpdate, August 1, 2025, 8:15AM ET: Added new photos showing potential iPhone 17 colors.\nUpdate, July 30, 2025, 11:08AM ET: Added latest leaks and rumors about the iPhone 17, and updated information on the iOS 26 public beta.\nUpdate, July 17, 2025, 4:40PM ET: Added latest information about iOS 26, possible materials for the Air, and the color options for the different models.\nUpdate, March 17, 2025, 2PM ET: Added details about the rumored price and features of the iPhone 17 Air.\nUpdate, April 11, 2025, 3:45PM ET: Added details from Front Page Tech's new video that claims to reveal details from a leaked iOS 19 build.\nKatie Teague contributed to this story.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/iphone-17-pro-max-and-air-everything-we-know-about-apples-new-phones-153024282.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "We still think getting a live TV streaming service is a better deal than paying for cable ‚Äî but the gulf between the two options is narrowing. Now that many of the major providers go for more than $80 per month, it‚Äôs not the amazing deal it once was. Still, live TV streaming plans have no contract, offer relatively simpler pricing and need no special equipment beyond a smart TV and an internet connection.After testing all the major players, we found YouTube TV to be the most well-rounded. But other services have their advantages, too, and there are plenty of free services as well. Here are the best live TV streaming services we tested, along with our advice on how to stream and what to look for.Editor‚Äôs note: We are still waiting to see launch date and pricing details for ESPN‚Äôs upcoming standalone streaming service. In the meantime, we‚Äôve learned that customers paying for any DirecTV Signature Package or the MySports Genre Pack will gain access to the Unlimited version of ESPN's service at no extra charge once it‚Äôs live. DirecTV customers with a Gemini device will also get access to the Disney+ and Hulu basic bundle. The announcement stems from a distribution agreement DirecTV reached with Disney (owner of ESPN) last September.¬†\nTable of contents\n\nBest live TV streaming services for 2025\nBest free live TV streaming services for 2025\nWhat to look for in a live TV streaming service\nHow we tested\nLive TV Streaming FAQs\nRecent updates\n\nBest live TV streaming services for 2025\n \n \n \n \n \n \nBack to top \nBest free live TV streaming services for 2025\nThere are plenty of ways to get free TV these days. To start, many standard streaming apps have added live components to their lineups. You‚Äôre paying for the service, so it‚Äôs not technically ‚Äúfree,‚Äù but you can get a dose of live TV without spending more than necessary. Peacock includes some regional NBC stations, and notably access to the 2024 Summer Olympic Games. Paramount+ subscribers can watch on-air CBS programming. The standard Hulu app has a live ABC news channel and Max now includes a live CNN outlet with its service, along with cable-like linear channels.\nThe smart TV operating system (OS) you use likely provides free live content too: Amazon‚Äôs Fire TV interface has a live tab and Roku‚Äôs built-in Roku Channel includes hundreds of live channels at no extra cost. The same goes for Samsung TV Plus, which added a trove of K-dramas to its free live and on-demand lineup in 2024. The PBS app offers local live streams of its channels ‚Äî even NASA has a free streaming service with live coverage.¬†\nBut for a full suite of live TV networks, and don‚Äôt want to sign up for any paid service, there are a number of free ad-supported TV services that have live TV. Even cable company DirecTV has joined the crowd with MyFree, and Fubo Free lets customers with a lapsed subscription keep watching some content. Here's the best of the live TV streaming services we tried:\n \n \n \n \n \nBack to top\nWhat to look for in a live TV streaming service\nHow to stream live TV\nStreaming live TV is a lot like using Netflix. You get access through apps on your phone, tablet, smart TV or streaming device and the signal arrives over the internet. A faster and more stable connection tends to give you a better experience. Most live TV apps require you to sign up and pay via a web browser. After that, you can activate the app on all of your devices.\nMonthly Price\nWhen I started testing these cord-cutting alternatives, I was struck by the price difference between live TV and a standard video streaming app. Where the latter cost between $5 and $20 per month, most live TV services hit the $80 mark and can go higher than $200 with additional perks, channel packages and premium extras. The higher starting price is mostly due to the cost of providing multiple networks ‚Äî particularly sports and local stations. And, in the past year or so, every service except Sling has raised base plan prices.\nLocal channels\nOnly two of the services I tried don‚Äôt include full local channel coverage for subscribers and one of those makes no effort to carry sports at all. That would be Philo and, as you might guess, it‚Äôs the cheapest. The next most affordable option, Sling, only carries three local stations ‚Äî and only in larger markets ‚Äî but it still manages to include some of the top sports channels.\nWhen you sign up with any provider that handles local TV, you‚Äôll enter your zip code, ensuring you get your area‚Äôs broadcast affiliates for ABC, CBS, FOX and NBC. Of course, you can also get those stations for free. Nearly all modern television sets support a radio frequency (RF) connection, also known as the coaxial port, which means if you buy an HD antenna, you‚Äôll receive locally broadcast stations like ABC, CBS, PBS, FOX and NBC. And since the signal is digital, reception is much improved over the staticky rabbit-ears era.\nBut local channel access is another area where traditional streaming services, like Netflix, are bleeding into broadcast territory. For example, you can watch your local NBC station with a Peacock subscription and you can tune into your area‚Äôs CBS station through your Paramount+ subscription. Netflix is even getting into the mix with a recently announced deal with one of France‚Äôs broadcast companies, TF1. The streaming service will now air TF1's live TV channels and on-demand content inside the Netflix app. No word if the concept will expand to other regions, but it‚Äôs an interesting move to anyone interested in the future of streaming.\nLive sports coverage\nOne reality that spun my head was the sheer number and iterations of sports networks in existence. Trying to figure out which network will carry the match-up you want to see can be tricky. I found that Google makes it a little easier for sports fans by listing out upcoming games (just swap in NBA, NFL, MLB, NHL and so on in the search bar). When you click an event, the ‚ÄúTV & streaming‚Äù button will tell you which network is covering it.\nThat just leaves figuring out if your chosen service carries the RSNs (regional sports networks) you want. Unfortunately, even with add-ons and extra packages, some providers simply don‚Äôt have certain channels in their lineups. It would take a lawyer to understand the ins and outs of streaming rights negotiations, and networks leave and return to live TV carriers all the time. That said, most major sporting events in the US are covered by ESPN, Fox Sports, TNT, USA and local affiliates.\nI should also point out that traditional streaming services have started adding live sports to their lineups. Peacock carries live Premier League matches, Sunday Night Football games and aired the 2024 Olympic Games from Paris. Thursday Night Football as well as NBA and WNBA games are on Amazon Prime and Christmas Day Football aired on Netflix. Max (formerly HBO Max) now airs select, regular season games from the NHL, MLB, NCAA and NBA with a $10-per-month add-on. You can watch MLS games with an add-on through the Apple TV app, and Apple TV+ includes some MLB games. Roku users can watch the just-added free sports channel and those who subscribe to Paramount Plus can see many of the matches aired on CBS Sports, including live NFL games. This year, even the Super Bowl was live-streamed for free on Tubi. While all of these alternatives may not cover as much ground as live TV streamers, they could end up being cheaper avenues to the sports you want.\nAnd if sports is all you‚Äôre after, there are sports-only plans that are a touch cheaper, too. The promised sports streaming service from ESPN, Fox and Warner Bros. called Venu was cancelled early this year. But in May, ESPN confirmed it will launch its own streaming service that will include all ESPN channels, though a start date hasn‚Äôt been confirmed. DirecTV recently  announced a $70-per-month, sports-only streaming package called MySports and Comcast now has a sports and news bundle for the same price (as long as you're an Xfinity customer with auto-pay, otherwise it's more expensive).\nTraditional cable networks\nDozens of linear programming networks were once only available with cable TV, like Bravo, BET, Food Network, HGTV, CNN, Lifetime, SYFY and MTV. If you only subscribe to, say, Netflix or Apple TV+, you won‚Äôt have access to those. But as with sports, standard streamers are starting to incorporate this content into their offerings. After the Warner Bros. merger, Max incorporated some content from HGTV, Discovery and TLC. Peacock has Bravo and Hallmark shows, and Paramount+ has material from Nickelodeon, MTV and Comedy Central.\nOther channels like AMC+ have stand-alone apps. The Discovery+ app gives you 15 channels ad-free for $9 per month (or with ads for $5 monthly). And a service called Frndly TV starts at a mere $7 per month and streams A&E, Lifetime, Game Show Network, Outdoor Channel and about 35 others. Of course, most live TV streaming options will deliver more sizable lists of cable networks, but just note that you may already be paying for some of them ‚Äî and if all you need is a certain channel, you could get it cheaper by subscribing directly.\nOn-demand streaming\nMost live TV subscriptions include access to a selection of video-on-demand (VOD) content, like you would get with a traditional streaming service. Much of this content is made up of the movies and TV series that have recently aired on your subscribed networks. This typically doesn‚Äôt cover live events and news programming, but I was able to watch specific episodes of ongoing shows like Top Chef or BET‚Äôs Diarra from Detroit. Just search the on-demand library for the program, pick an episode and hit play.\nPartnerships, like Hulu‚Äôs relationship with Disney, and add-ons, such as bundling Max with your YouTube TV subscription or Starz with your Sling plan, will let you watch even larger libraries of on-demand content. But again, if VOD is all you‚Äôre after, paying for those networks directly instead of through a live TV plan will be far cheaper.\nDigital video recordings (DVR) limits\nEvery option I tried offers some cloud DVR storage without needing a separate physical device. You‚Äôll either get unlimited storage for recordings that expires after nine months or a year, or you‚Äôll get a set number of hours (between 50 and 1,000) that you can keep indefinitely. Typically, all you need to do is designate what ongoing TV series you want to record and the DVR component will do all the hard work of saving subsequent episodes for you to watch later. You can do the same thing with sports events.\nAside from being able to watch whenever it‚Äôs most convenient, you can also fast-forward through commercials in recorded content. In contrast, you can‚Äôt skip them on live TV or VOD.\nSimultaneous streams and profiles per account\nEach plan gives you a certain number of simultaneous streams, aka how many screens can play content at the same time. And while most providers will let you travel with your subscription, there are usually location restrictions that require you to sign in from your home IP address periodically. Stream allowances range from one at a time to unlimited screens (or as many as your ISP‚Äôs bandwidth can handle). Some plans require add-ons to get more screens.\nMost services also let you set up a few profiles so I was able to give different people in my family the ability to build their own watch histories and libraries, set their favorite channels and get individual recommendations.\nPicture-in-picture mode and multiview\nPicture-in-picture (PiP) usually refers to shrinking a video window on a mobile device or computer browser so you can watch it while using other apps. Sling, YouTube TV, FuboTV, Philo, DirecTV Stream and Hulu + Live TV all have PiP modes on computers and mobile devices. Another feature, multiview, lets you view multiple live sports games at once on your TV screen. YouTube TV and FuboTV are the only live TV streamers that let you do this. With YouTube TV, you can select up to four views from a few preset selection of streams. FuboTV offers the same feature, but only if you're using an Apple TV or Roku streaming device.\n4K live streams\nRight now, just FuboTV, YouTube TV and DirecTV Stream offer 4K live streams ‚Äî but with caveats. YouTube TV requires a $20-per-month add-on, after which you‚Äôll only be able to watch certain live content in 4K. DirecTV Stream has three channels that show live 4K content ‚Äî one with shows and original series, and two with occasional sporting events. You don‚Äôt have to pay extra for these but you do need to have either DirecTV‚Äôs Gemini receiver, or a device from Fire TV, Apple TV or Roku. You‚Äôll need those same streaming devices to watch the select 4K programming on Sling as well. FuboTV shows certain live events in 4K but access is limited to the Elite and Premier packages, not the base-level Pro plan.\nOf course, watching any 4K content also requires equipment that can handle it: a 4K smart TV or 4K streaming device paired with a cord and screen that can handle 4K resolution.\nTiers, packages and add-ons\nComparing price-to-offering ratios is a task for a spreadsheet. I‚Ä¶ made three. The base plans range from $28 to $85 per month. From there, you can add packages, which are usually groups of live TV channels bundled by themes like news, sports, entertainment or international content. Premium VOD extras like Max, AMC+ and Starz are also available. Add-ons cost an extra $5 to $20 each per month and simply show up in the guide where you find the rest of your live TV. This is where streaming can quickly get expensive, pushing an $80 subscription to $200 monthly, depending on what you choose.\nHow to stream live TV for free\nI also downloaded and tried out a few apps that offer free ad-supported TV (FAST) including Freevee, Tubi, PlutoTV and Sling Freestream. These let you drop in and watch a more limited selection of live networks at zero cost. Most don‚Äôt even require an email address, let alone a credit card. And if you have a Roku device, an Amazon Fire TV or Stick, a Samsung TV, a Chromecast device or a Google TV, you already have access to hundreds of live channels via the Roku Channel, the live tab in Fire TV, through the Samsung TV Plus app or through Google TV.\nBack to top\nHow we tested\nWhen I begin testing for a guide, I research the most popular and well-reviewed players in the category and narrow down which are worth trying. For the paid plans, just six services dominate so I tried them all. There are considerably more free live TV contenders so I tested the four most popular. After getting accounts set up using my laptop, I downloaded the apps on a Samsung smart TV running the latest version of Tizen OS. I counted the local stations and regional sports coverage, and noted how many of the top cable networks were available. I then weighed the prices, base packages and available add-ons.\nI then looked at how the programming was organized in each app‚Äôs UI and judged how easy everything was to navigate, from the top navigation to the settings. To test the search function, I searched for the same few TV shows on BET, Food Network, HGTV and Comedy Central, since all six providers carry those channels. I noted how helpful the searches were and how quickly they got me to season 6, episode 13 of Home Town.\nI used DVR to record entire series and single movies and watched VOD shows, making sure to test the pause and scan functions. On each service with sports, I searched for the same four upcoming NHL, NBA, MLS and NCAA basketball matches and used the record option to save the games and play them back a day or two later. Finally, I noted any extra perks or irritating quirks.\nAll live TV streaming services we‚Äôve tested:\n\nPhilo\nSling\nYouTube TV\nHulu + Live TV\nDirecTV Stream\nFuboTV\nFreevee\nTubi\nPlutoTV\nSling Freestream\nPlex\n\nBack to top\nLive TV Streaming FAQs\nWhat is live streaming?\nStreaming simply refers to video content that is delivered to your screen over the internet. Live streaming can be split into two categories: linear programming and simultaneous transmission. That first one is similar to what you get with cable or broadcast TV, with channels that play a constant flow of movies and shows (sort of what TV looked like before Netflix). Simultaneous streaming lets you watch live events (like a basketball game) or a program (like the evening news) as they happen.\nWhat is the difference between streaming and live streaming?\nStandard streaming, the most popular example being Netflix, lets you pick what you want to watch from a menu of choices. It‚Äôs also referred to as ‚Äúvideo on demand.‚Äù Live streaming refers to sports and news events that you can stream as they happen in real time. It also refers to channels that show a continuous, linear flow of programming.\nWhat streaming service is best for live TV?\nFuboTV does the best job of letting you organize live channels to help you find just what you want to watch. The interface is uncluttered and when you search for something, the UI clearly tells you whether something is live now or on-demand. YouTube TV also does a good job making that info clear. Both have just over 100 live channels on offer.\nWhat is the most cost effective TV streaming service?\nFree TV streaming services like PlutoTV, Plex, Tubi and FreeVee show plenty of ad-supported TV shows and movies without charging you anything. Of course, they won‚Äôt have the same channels or content that more premium subscriptions have. Ultimately it depends on what you want to watch and finding the service that can supply that to you in the most streamlined form so you‚Äôre not paying for stuff you don‚Äôt need.\nIs it cheaper to have cable or streaming?\nA basic cable package used to be more expensive than the base-level live TV streaming service. But now that nearly all major providers have raised their prices to over $75 per month, that‚Äôs no longer the case. And with add-ons and other premiums, you can easily pay over $200 a month for either cable or a live TV streaming service.\nWhat streaming service has all the TV channels?\nNo service that we tested had every available channel. Hulu + Live TV and DirecTV Stream carry the the highest number of the top rated channels, according to Neilsen. Hulu‚Äôs service also gets you Disney+ fare, which you can‚Äôt get elsewhere. FuboTV has the most sports channels and YouTube TV gives you the widest selection of add-ons.\nWhat is the most popular live TV streaming platform?\nYouTube TV has the most paying customers. According to 2024's letter from the CEO, the service has over eight million subscribers. Disney‚Äôs 2024 third quarter earnings put the Hulu + Live TV viewer count at 4.6 million. Sling‚Äôs customer count dipped from two million to about 1.9 million in 2024 and FuboTV grew its subscriber list to 1.6 million.\nHow safe are free streaming services and websites?\nYou may have heard certain sites that provide free content can be dangerous, leading to stolen info and/or exposing you to malware. That‚Äôs likely in reference to certain peer-to-peer (P2P) networks and file-sharing sites that let people download free movies and series ‚Äî which can come bundled with malicious code.\nBut if you‚Äôre talking about the free ad-supported streaming television (FAST) services listed here, from providers like PlutoTV, Tubi and Freevee, they are just as safe as any other streaming service. Since you sometimes don‚Äôt even have to provide your email address or credit card info, they can even be more anonymous than apps that require login credentials.\nBack to top\nRecent updates\nJanuary 31, 2025: Added information about which streaming service would live-stream the Super Bowl, including Tubi‚Äôs free option. Updated Fubo‚Äôs pricing. Added details about DirectTV Stream‚Äôs sports-only package and Comcast‚Äôs sports and news bundle.\nJanuary 16, 2025: Included higher prices for Sling‚Äôs Orange and Blue plans. Noted the demise of the never-launched Venu sports streaming service and mentioned the inclusion of DirecTV‚Äôs new sports package.\nDecember 31, 2024: Noted increased pricing for YouTube TV, Hulu+ Live TV and DirecTV. Updated information for 4K streaming capabilities and requirements for multiple services. Reported on the upcoming shut down of Amazon‚Äôs Freevee service and the addition of DirecTV‚Äôs free service.\nAugust 6, 2024: Updated with the addition of Plex as a free live TV streaming recommendation and mentioned the additional free channels Philo is now including with the free version of its service. Added pricing information for ESPN's new sports-only streaming service, Venu.¬†\nJune 12, 2024: Updated with more information about 4K live streaming, picture-in-picture and multiview modes, as well as video on-demand options. We expanded our recommendations around free live TV streaming services and added a FAQ query about the safety of free streaming services and clarified the difference between standard and live streaming. More traditional streaming services have added live and sports components, so we revised that section accordingly.\nBack to topThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/best-live-tv-streaming-service-133000410.html?src=rss",
    "full_text": "It‚Äôs similar to other free ad supported TV streamers, with a limited channel selection through the same Fubo interface. It‚Äôs still the service that most closely resembles cable, complete with numbered channels and somewhat confusing plan structures. There‚Äôs still no way to stop whatever is playing as you browse the guide ‚Äî something I find irritating, but it might not bother everyone. The same goes for Samsung TV Plus, which added a trove of K-dramas to its free live and on-demand lineup in 2024. The FAST service has around 800 live TV channels that are organized fairly granularly and you can have up to 15 profiles. There was once a nifty integration with notable music streaming service Tidal, but that collaboration sadly came to an end late in 2024. People who don‚Äôt pay for Prime will still be able to access some of the free content through that app. Aside from being able to watch whenever it‚Äôs most convenient, you can also fast-forward through commercials in recorded content. Each plan gives you a certain number of simultaneous streams, aka how many screens can play content at the same time. YouTube TV requires a $20-per-month add-on, after which you‚Äôll only be able to watch certain live content in 4K."

Naturally, this new version of Google's Gemini 2.5 Deep Think is designed for complicated questions that require much more work than you'd expect from a free or cheap AI chatbot. Google said it's designed to handle prompts that require strategic planning, creativity and deep reasoning. That subscription, first announced earlier this year at Google's I/O developer conference, is a steep price to pay for generative AI tools. (You can still access other Gemini models either for free or at a $20-per-month tier.) Generative AI developers are intent on building ever more powerful models, and one big way they're doing so is by expanding their ability for research and increasing the amount of time these models can work. OpenAI has a Deep Research tool for ChatGPT users, and Google's Gemini has a tool by the same name for all users. While those research modes allow models more time, Deep Think uses \"parallel thinking\" to consider different ideas at once, combining or revising them as it goes."

    "full_text": "Table of Contents This All-Terrain Electric Scooter Punches Above Its Budget-Friendly Price That would mean more if Turboant didn't specialize in inexpensive models best suited for casually zipping around town and last-mile commutes. Just bolt on the handlebars, charge it up (a full charge from empty takes 6 to 8 hours), and you're good to go. As for the signal lights, there's no visual indication on the display, but there's at least a beep to remind you to shut them off once you make your turn. It has a four-spring suspension setup, which helps smooth out rough pavement and the occasional dirt path. This isn't a trail shredder by any means, but perfect for imperfect city streets. It ships in kickstart mode by default; you'll need to push off before the motor engages. But you can disable that by pressing the power button four times. The R9 can travel up to 35 miles on a full charge of its 48-volt, 12.5-amp-hour (600-watt-hour) battery. I really like that Turboant includes this info on a card with the scooter to set expectations."

With Apple Watch season fast approaching, it's hard to ignore how far behind Siri now feels in comparison. After seeing what Gemini can do, anything less feels like a missed opportunity. Siri, Bixby (Samsung's version) and even Google Assistant on older watches often felt like clunky middlemen. Google's Gemini AI voice assistant on the Galaxy Watch 8. But nothing yet addresses Siri's longstanding weaknesses: slow responses, minimal context and virtually no follow-through. And it's not like Apple isn't aware; the company has acknowledged it's working on a smarter Siri, but that update is now reportedly delayed until 2026. Meanwhile Apple's current AI efforts like image editing, Genmoji and tapping ChatGPT show promise. I'm not expecting miracles from the Apple Watch Series 11, but there's an opportunity here. If Apple upgrades the watch's processor to better handle on-device tasks, it could pave the way for a more responsive, Gemini-like assistant that actually belongs on your wrist."

CD Projekt Red did an incredible job making arguably the best-looking Switch 2 game. Granted, the roaming NPCs didn't do much to affect your game but they provided that feeling of being in a sprawling city landscape. They'll be in for a treat but if you played any version of Cyberpunk, there is little reason to spend money on this game. Players can also spin out other racers by timing their boosts just right. If there is a truly unique game, it's Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess. Nobunaga's Ambition: Awakening is one of the oldest turn-based strategy video game franchises. Players step into the role of a daimyo and have to expand their lands while also being diplomatic with other leaders. There aren't really any \"visuals\" other than world maps, character portraits and so many menus."

This is more geeky and less obvious to everyday phone owners, but that's also kind of the point. The iPhone 16E shipped with Apple's C1 cellular modem, Apple's first homebrew cellular hardware it has been trying to build in order to wean its dependence on Qualcomm, which has provided the modem hardware in previous iPhone models.

    "summary": "Your new iPad is sleek, powerful and ready to tackle everything from binge-watching to serious productivity ‚Äî but without the right protection, it‚Äôs also one drop away from disaster. One of the most important iPad accessories is a solid case. Whether you want something rugged to handle everyday wear and tear, a slim case that keeps things lightweight or a keyboard cover to turn your tablet into a mini laptop, there are plenty of options to suit your needs.Some cases go beyond basic protection, offering adjustable stands for better viewing angles, built-in storage for your Apple Pencil or even added durability for clumsy moments. We‚Äôve rounded up the best iPad accessories to keep your new iPad safe and functional.\nBest iPad cases for 2025\n \n \n \n \n \nWhy do I need an iPad case?\nIt‚Äôs almost always a good idea to keep your iPad in a case so it‚Äôs protected against hazards and accidents. The best iPads are expensive ‚Äî even the most affordable model will set you back at least $300 ‚Äî so you‚Äôll want to safeguard your gear as much as possible. \niPad case FAQs\nWhat is the difference between an iPad case and an iPad cover?\nAll iPad covers are cases, but not all iPad cases are covers ‚Äî yes, it‚Äôs a bit confusing, but allow us to explain. Most iPad covers are cases that surround the back of your tablet and have a flap that covers the screen, so it provides protection for the body as well as its display. Plenty of iPad cases also have screen covers, but you don‚Äôt have to get one with that feature. Instead, you could just get a case that hugs the back of the tablet and nothing else. Those accessories will be marginally thinner and lighter than their cover-toting counterparts, and give your iPad a more svelte profile.\nHow often should I charge my iPad?\nHow often you charge your iPad will depend on how often you use it. Most iPads will last at least a regular work day with frequent usage, which is one of the reasons why many have opted to use their iPads as laptop replacements. But with heavy usage, like constant video streaming or gaming, will come more rapid battery drain. A good rule of thumb is to charge your iPad when you go to sleep each night, that way you‚Äôll have a topped-up device waiting for you in the morning.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-ipad-cases-to-protect-your-tablet-130033533.html?src=rss",

OtterBox Best iPad case with extra protection OtterBox Defender Series Case Features: Auto sleep/wake, magnetic closure, 4-way stand | Form: Hard shell | Connectivity: N/A If you‚Äôre not messing around with your iPad, look no further than Otterbox‚Äôs Defender series of cases. In addition to passing more than 24 shock, abrasion and drop tests, Defender cases have a built-in screen protector and covers for the single port on all of the latest iPad models for extra durability. You can also detach the Shield Stand and use it to prop up your iPad for better viewing. It feels surprisingly sturdy, and the keyboard itself is great to use for long periods of time. While it does offer one of the best typing experiences you can get with the selection of iPad Pro cases and other models, there are two major drawbacks to the Magic Keyboard: it doesn‚Äôt provide a ton of drop protection, and it‚Äôs expensive. Without a doubt, it‚Äôs the most luxurious iPad case on this list, but those who want to make their iPad as functional as possible will get a lot of use out of it. The backlit keyboard is pretty spacious and includes a multi-touch trackpad for more precise on-screen control. There‚Äôs also a spot for your Apple Pencil, so it‚Äôll be close at hand when you need to mark up a document, navigate apps or doodle an idea in Apple Notes.

    "summary": "Whether you‚Äôre a true cord-cutter or you just want to watch the next season of Stranger Things when it drops, everyone‚Äôs on the lookout for streaming deals nowadays. Plenty have chosen VOD and live TV streaming services over traditional cable in recent years, but the savings that choice got you just a few years ago have somewhat evaporated now. Companies like Netflix, Disney, Max and others have been consistently raising prices to the point where you may question if streaming is even worth it anymore.\nWe at Engadget still think so, for many reasons, but you can (and should) be smart with your money at the same time. Streaming deals are an option, even if they don‚Äôt come around with the same regularity as discounts on AirPods do. If you‚Äôre looking to save money and still stream all of the content you want, Engadget can help by laying out the best streaming deals you can get right now, how you can save with bundles and everything you should know before paying for yet another streaming service. \nBest streaming deals\nTrue streaming deals can be hard to come by. Most often, they‚Äôll pop up during the Black Friday shopping period. On occasion, we‚Äôll see them sparingly throughout the year and they usually take the form of a discounted monthly or annual rate for a limited period of time. Also, true streaming deals are typically on the ad-supported versions of a service, but once in a while you‚Äôll find a unicorn of a deal on a tier that has ad-free viewing.\nIf you‚Äôre able to wait for a deal before subscribing to a streaming service, we recommend doing so. You‚Äôll save money upfront and in the long run, and you also have the option to cancel your subscription before the price goes back up to the normal rate. Maybe you find you like the service so much that you‚Äôre fine paying full price for it ‚Äî that‚Äôs the ideal situation. But if you‚Äôre not compelled to keep that app on rotation in your smart TV, most streaming services make it easy for you to cancel at any time. With that said, these are the best streaming deals you can snag right now.\n \nYouTube TV (two months) for $120 ($46 off): You can get two months of our favorite live TV streaming service for $60 per month which works out to $46 less than paying the full $83 each month. And right now, the service is free for the first 21 days. That should give you a decent chunk of time to see if the service is right for you. The discount and trial are only open to new subscribers to YouTube TV‚Äôs base plan, which includes access to over 100 channels, unlimited DVR space and six household accounts with the ability to stream on three devices at once.¬†\nSling Orange for $23/month for the first month (50 percent off): New customers can get Sling Orange or Sling Blue for half off the usual price for the first month, bringing the final prices to $23/month and $25.50/month, respectively. Orange is likely best for sports fans, with eight exclusive sports and family channels, while Blue includes 19 exclusive news and entertainment channels. You can get both Orange and Blue access also for half off for one month, or $33 total.\nFubo Pro for $65/month for the first month ($20 off): Fubo has introductory discounts on most of its packages, and the Pro package is the least expensive plan currently listed. It offers access to 224 channels, unlimited cloud DVR and up to 10 simultaneous streams. It even includes regional sports content from the NHL, MLB and NBA.\nSpotify Premium Individual (1 month) for $0 ($12 off): This is our favorite music streaming service for podcasts and social features. Right now, users who have not signed up for Spotify's Premium service before are eligible to get one month for free. The Premium Individual plan lets you listen ad-free and skip songs at will. You can also organize your listening queue and download content for offline listening. Just be aware, your subscription will auto-renew at the end of the trial period. So if you don't want to be on the hook for the $12 monthly fee, set a reminder to cancel and go back to the free version.\nHBO Max student discount ‚Äî subscribe for $5/month (50 percent off): HBO Max offers their ad-supported tier to students for half off the usual rate. You‚Äôll just have to verify that you‚Äôre a student through Unidays, and make note that this offer is only good for up to 12 months of service.\nHulu student discount ‚Äî subscribe for $2/month (75 percent off): Those with a valid student ID can get Hulu‚Äôs ad-supported tier for 75 percent off the typical rate. They‚Äôll keep the same sale price for as long as they‚Äôre a student as well.\nSpotify student discount ‚Äî Premium + Hulu with ads for $6/month (72 percent off): Spotify‚Äôs student offer continues to be one of the best around, giving you access to the Premium tier of the music streamer and Hulu‚Äôs ad-supported plan for only $6 monthly. Purchased separately, you‚Äôd pay $22 per month for both of the services. Plus, the first month is free when you sign up.\nNBA League Pass student discount ‚Äî one year for $120 (40 percent off): Students can get one year of League Pass for only $10 per month, which includes access to NBA TV and the ability to watch classic and archive games on-demand. On the NBA League Pass website, look for the student discount banner at the top and follow the instructions to verify your student status.\nPeacock first responders discount ‚Äî one year for $48 (50 percent off): Medical professionals and first responders can save 50 percent each year of Peacock. The deal requires annual verification and is open to those who work for either private or public institutions. Peacock has some great stuff to watch, including Poker Face and Killing It and more.\nStreaming bundle discounts\nThere‚Äôs more consolidation happening now than ever before in the streaming space, and that means there are more streaming bundle options. These bundles offer you access to more content with one subscription price, but those prices are typically higher than paying for a single service by itself (obviously). It may be tempting to just get the bundle, but if only one of those services in the bundle speaks to you, you‚Äôll spend less overall by just paying for the single service.\nSpeaking of a deep love for a single streaming service: if all of your favorite shows are on Peacock or the latest releases on HBO Max consistently bring you joy, consider paying for one year upfront. Subscribing with an annual plan usually saves you money in the long term over paying on a monthly basis. Unfortunately, not all streaming services (looking at you, Netflix) have an annual subscription option. Here are some of the best streaming bundles you can get right now.\n \nDisney+, Hulu, HBO Max bundle with ads for $17/month: Ad-supported HBO Max is included here, along with full, ad-supported access to Disney+ and Hulu. You‚Äôll save 43 percent with this bundle, as opposed to paying for all three services individually.\nDisney+ and Hulu Bundle Premium for $20/month: Disney and Hulu offer a few different bundles, which you can view in the drop-down lists under Choose Your Plan. This bundle removes the ads from both Disney+ and Hulu (with the exception of select live and linear content) and allows you to download content for offline viewing. You‚Äôll save 42 percent with this bundle, as opposed to paying for both ad-free tiers individually.\nParamount+ with Showtime for $13/month or $120/year: This includes everything in Paramount+‚Äôs Essential plan, except the ads, and also provides access to Showtime content, live CBS streams and download features.\nSling TV + HBO Max starting at $53/month: Sling TV and HBO Max have partnered on a discount that gives new subscribers 50 percent off their first month of Sling TV, plus $5 off monthly when you subscribe to the Sling TV + HBO Max bundle. The standard price for the Sling Blue + HBO Max duo is roughly $58/month, so you'll get a monthly discount of $5 off that. In addition, for the first month only, you'll get half off the price of the bundle. The promotion also applies to the Sling Orange & Blue + HBO Max package, which has a standard price of $73/month.\nHulu + Live TV with Disney+ and ESPN+ for $96/month: This streaming bundle amalgamation is a bit confusing but it does offer a lot: you get live TV streaming via Hulu‚Äôs service plus access to the following VOD services: Hulu, Disney+ and ESPN+. Out of those three, only ESPN+ will have ads.\nDisney+, Hulu, ESPN+ Bundle Basic for $17/month: You get full access to Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+ content with this package, albeit with ads across the board. This bundle price is 46 percent off the total price of all three separate subscriptions.\nDisney+, Hulu, ESPN+ Bundle Premium for $27/month: Similarly to the Duo bundles, the Premium version of the Trio removes ads from most content in Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+, and you can download content for offline viewing. This price represents a 43-percent savings when compared to paying for all three ad-free tiers separately.\nRead more streaming coverage\n\nThe best live TV streaming services to cut cable\nThe best streaming services: Netflix, Hulu, HBO Max and more\nThe best streaming devices\n\nFollow @EngadgetDeals on X for the latest tech deals and buying advice.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/best-streaming-service-deals-133028980.html?src=rss",

The Baltic states have established themselves as a fintech hub, but also have scientific talent that‚Äôs easier for a startup like Handwave to attract and afford than in Silicon Valley ‚Äî including AI engineers."

The company released the first iPhone in 2007 and sold its billionth iPhone in 2016. It is  believed to have shipped its two billionth sometime in 2021, and now only four years later, it has reached the new milestone. Apple's CEO said the iPhone enjoyed a double digit growth in the third quarter and that the company earned $94 billion in revenue, up 10 percent year over year. In a tweet, Apple expert Mark Gurman suggested that iPhone sales over the past quarter were driven by people who bought one out of fear that the device would be out of their reach in the future due to Trump's tariffs.¬†\nApple should be very pleased with the folks who spread the lies that the iPhone will cost $3000 or $25,000 if made in the U.S. Clearly that helped a ton for the June quarter.‚Äî Mark Gurman (@markgurman) July 31, 2025\n\nSpeaking of tariffs, they cost the company $800 million in the quarter ending in June, Cook said during the call. In the next quarter ending in September, Apple believes tariffs will cost the company $1.1 billion.¬†\nApple is slated to announce its next iPhone models in a matter of weeks, probably sometime in September like last year's devices. Gurman previously reported that Apple is releasing an iPhone 17 Air this generation to match the Air models of its other products. It will reportedly be an ultra-thin phone, as its designation implies, will have a single camera lens and be powered by a basic A19 chip. The phone could also be equipped with Apple's in-house modem that debuted with the iPhone 16e and come with a 6.6-inch screen. It could cost buyers around $900, which is around $100 more than the base iPhone 16 and is on par with the price of the iPhone 16 Plus.¬†\nIn addition to announcing Apple's three billionth iPhone, Cook also announced during the call that the company is \"significantly growing out investments\" in artificial intelligence. He said an acquisition to boost its AI efforts and accelerate its roadmap wasn't out of the question, though he didn't name any specific company that Apple could potentially purchase.¬†¬†This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/apple-has-now-shipped-3-billion-iphones-030851439.html?src=rss",

The results revealed that the majority of Reddit‚Äôs revenue continues to come from ads, which brought in $465 million, representing 93% of the company‚Äôs total revenue. Last month, Reddit launched two new features for advertisers: Reddit Insights, a tool that leverages the billions of posts and comments on the platform to spot trends and offer real-time insights for campaign strategies, and Conversation Summary Add-ons, which let advertisers include Reddit user discussions directly in ads, showing public opinions about products or brands. Reddit said the category jumped 24% year-over-year to $35 million, up from $28.1 million in the same period a year prior. Reddit has already established content licensing agreements with major players in AI, including Google and OpenAI. Although these deals are still new, the results from the second quarter point out a steady income stream that has significant potential for the long haul. Another key AI-powered feature is the Reddit Answers tool, which launched in December. This tool, which offers answers in a conversational interface, has attracted 6 million weekly users, a considerable jump from 1 million users in the previous quarter. In a letter to shareholders, Reddit CEO Steve Huffman said the platform is working to integrate the tool ‚Äúmore deeply into the core search experience‚Äù to make ‚Äúsearch a central feature across Reddit.‚Äù"

It took Apple nine years to sell the billionth iPhone, a milestone the company reached in 2016. This implies that Apple sold 2 billion between 2016 and now ‚Äî also a nine-year period ‚Äî marking the product‚Äôs growing popularity. While Apple celebrates 3 billion iPhones sold, the company has struggled a bit in the stock market this year, as the tech giant fell behind Nvidia and Microsoft as the market‚Äôs most highly valued businesses. So perhaps a bigger cause for celebration at Apple is that its iPhone sales were stronger this quarter than expected. Sales of the iPhone, Apple‚Äôs most popular product, are up 13% year-over-year, generating $44.6 billion in revenue, according to information shared on the earnings call. That‚Äôs nearly half of the entire company‚Äôs total revenue this quarter, which reached $94 billion. This uptick in iPhone sales might be temporary, though.

High Noon discovered the error after receiving a shipment of empty Celsius cans instead of empty High Noon cans, according to a statement. Here's which lot codes were impacted and what to do if you bought these cans. What to do if you were impacted by High Noon's drink recall High Noon advises people who bought the following codes of Celsius Astro Vibe Energy Drink, Sparkling Blue Razz Edition not to consume it and to discard it. Other High Noon variety packs should not be affected. High Noon reported that no illnesses or events occurred as a part of the mislabeling. If you've purchased the impacted drinks, contact High Noon Consumer Relations at consumerrelations@highnoonvodka.com for next steps and refunds. CNET reached out to High Noon for comment but did not receive an immediate response."

    "full_text": "During the most recent Prime Day, the Google Pixel Tablet with Wi-Fi and 256GB of storage briefly dropped to just $309 ($190 off) ‚Äî but the deal disappeared in a matter of hours. Unfortunately, the discount is for today only (or until supplies last) and doesn‚Äôt include the speaker dock. In his Pixel Tablet review, former Verge editor Dan Seifert noted that the device doesn‚Äôt seem interested in pushing the boundaries, but its solid hardware and speedy performance make it a great option for Android users. The device features a sharp 11-inch LCD display, a soft-touch matte finish, and four speakers that provide clear audio and noticeable stereo separation. Like most modern devices, it lacks a headphone jack, so you‚Äôll have to either use Bluetooth or USB-C headphones. Meanwhile, the tablet integrates well with an optional fabric speaker dock. At this point, Google‚Äôs tablet aspirations are up in the air, with rumors suggesting any subsequent sequels have been canned. The company has an event scheduled for August 20th, where we‚Äôre expecting new Pixel phones to debut, including a new book-style foldable. Whether or not we‚Äôll see a new tablet remains to be seen. It‚Äôs worth noting, however, that Google is only promising three years of software upgrades and five years of security updates from its release in 2023, which is much shorter than the seven years of support offered for newer Pixel phones."

The Handsfree 2 offers five outputs, all of which can be used simultaneously. Bluetti says the Handsfree 2 can support over 66 pounds of load total due to its reinforced back and bottom panels. Inside the backpack are compartments with removable dividers, letting you store camera accessories and attachments. They sometimes have wheels and can be lifted, but they are not seriously portable like the Bluetti Handfree 2, which can simply be carried with you no matter how rough the terrain is."

The beta will be playable on PC, PS5 and Xbox Series X/S.

Twitch's drops campaign list includes various campaigns that reward players for watching streams participating in the campaign -- like this one granting early access to Battlefield 6's public beta. There is one way to secure your spot in the open beta a couple days early on Aug. 7: Watch your favorite streamer playing Battlefield 6 today (July 31), as explained in an official post on X. You can watch on the official Battlefield Twitch or on a participating creator's channel, but if you didn't watch already, the beta key event ended at 4:30 p.m. PT. Here were the steps to get early access using Twitch streams -- if DICE releases more keys this way, here's how to earn early access beta keys: Watch a single streamer participating in the Battlefield 6 Early Access Beta Key Drops for 60 minutes -- if you're having trouble finding one, search for \"Battlefield 6\" and look for streams that include \"Beta Key Drops\" or often just \"Drops\" in their titles. Players who have participated in Battlefield Labs, studio DICE's pre-release feedback program for the game, will be granted early access to play the beta starting Aug. 7."

It's clear that Franklin is no average infant either -- Galactus identified the baby as a worthy planet-eating successor, and Franklin's mere presence around his mother seemed enough to resurrect her after the final boss battle. The scene takes place four years later, meaning Franklin is no longer a tiny tot. But the good times are cut short when Sue senses something is off. The Avengers movie will star Robert Downey Jr. as Doom and is scheduled for release on Dec. 18, 2026. The two were once university classmates but never close friends as Victor put himself above everyone. Over the course of storylines, they've battled each other while occasionally dropping their beef to fight a common threat. Franklin can create what's called \"pocket universes,\" which are basically self-contained within a larger universe. and Fantastic Four, Doctor Doom could be looking to harness the young boy's powers to either stop -- or take advantage of -- whatever disaster is on the horizon."

According to Deadline, Jeremy Allen White from ‚ÄúThe Bear‚Äù is being considered for the role of Horwitz, while Mikey Madison, known for her Oscar-winning role in ‚ÄúAnora,‚Äù may portray Frances Haugen, the whistleblower behind the articles who was a former product manager at Facebook.

    "summary": "Liquid Glass is a huge new change coming to iOS 26. (Apple)\nIf waiting until the fall to gain access to all of Apple's iOS 26 features seems too far away, I've got good news. You can actually give it a test run now by downloading and installing the public beta. You can also check out our preview of the iOS 26 public beta release, which shows off the fresh home and lock screen redesign we've been asking to see for years. Called Liquid Glass, the new translucent look will extend across all of Apple's upcoming operating systems. The overhaul is one of several big changes coming to iOS, macOS, iPadOS and the rest of Apple's software suite, all of which were showcased during the company's WWDC keynote on June 9.¬†\nAfter overpromising on AI plans last year, Apple kept its iOS roadmap focused more on basic quality of life improvements this year. There are multiple useful additions coming to the Phone and Messages apps on your iPhone, for instance: Apple execs outlined the ability to weed out spam texts or other unknown senders and an option to hold your spot on a phone call when you've been waiting for a representative to pick up. Plus, a treasured feature that we took for granted is coming back (hint: it's in the Photos app).\nSiri, meanwhile, is in a holding pattern. Apple has previously specified that its smarter voice assistant ‚Äî first promised at WWDC 2024 ‚Äî is delayed until some point \"in the coming year,\" so you shouldn't expect any major changes in the current betas. But there are reports that Apple is aiming to give Siri a bigger brain transplant by basing it on third-party artificial intelligence models like OpenAI's ChatGPT or Anthropic's Claude, which could make 2026 a pivotal year.\nWith each beta, it seems like additional new improvements are popping up, like a newly discovered FaceTime feature that'll freeze your video if it detects nudity. Most newer iPhone models are eligible to download iOS 26 (both the betas and final version). Want to see the full list of new features coming this fall? Read on.¬†¬†\nWhat is iOS 26?\nThe current iPhone operating system is iOS 18, and Apple is still actively updating it ‚Äî version 18.6 was just recently released. But don't expect to see iOS 19. Instead, Apple is skipping the numbering ahead to iOS 26 later this year. The company has decided to line up its iOS version numbers with a year-based system, similar to car model years. So while iOS and its sibling operating systems will be released in late 2025, they're all designated \"26\" to reflect the year ahead. (Meanwhile, iOS 18 is still getting new versions this summer, too.)\nIt's official, we're moving to iOS 26. (Apple)\nWhat is Liquid Glass design?\nLet's be honest. Out of everything announced at WWDC this year, the new Liquid Glass design was the star of the show. The iPhone's home and lock screens have looked pretty much the same year after year ‚Äî the last exciting thing (in my opinion) was the option to add your own aesthetic to your home screen by customizing your apps and widgets. So seeing the home and lock screens' new facelift is refreshing.\nSo what exactly is Liquid Glass? Apple calls it a \"new translucent material\" since, well, the apps and widgets are clear. However, the screen can still adapt to dark and light modes, depending on surroundings. You'll also notice buttons with a new floating design in several apps, like Phone and Maps. They're designed to be less distracting than the current buttons, but are still easy to see. While the design overhaul has proven to be controversial since its announcement, some ‚Äî including Engadget's own Devindra Hardawar ‚Äî like the new direction, even if it's somewhat reminiscent of Microsoft's translucent Windows Vista Aero designs from nearly twenty years ago.\nThat said, as of the release of the iOS 26 beta 2, Apple has already incorporated some user feedback into the design, dialing back the transparency in at least some places. And while it will continue to evolve, Apple users won't be able to escape it: Liquid Glass was designed to make all of Apple's OSes more cohesive. Here's a look at how the translucent aesthetic will look with the new macOS Tahoe 26 on your desktop.\nWhat are the new and notable features of iOS 26?\niOS 26 has a laundry list of new features. Among the most worthwhile:\nPhone app redesign: You'll finally be able to scroll through contacts, recent calls and voicemail messages all on one screen. It also comes with a new feature called Hold Assist that'll notify you when an agent comes to the phone so you can avoid the elevator music and continue on with other tasks.\nLive Translation in Phone, FaceTime and Messages: iOS 26 is bringing the ability to have a conversation via phone call or text message with someone who speaks another language. Live Translation will translate your conversation in real time, which results in some stop-and-go interactions in the examples Apple shared during its presentation.\nPolls in group chats: Tired of sorting through what seems like hundreds of messages in your group chat? You and your friends will soon be able to create polls in group messages for deciding things like which brunch spot you're eating at or whose car you're taking on a road trip.\nFiltering unknown senders in Messages: If you haven't received spam texts about unpaid tolls or other citations, you're lucky. For those of us who have, those annoying messages will soon be filtered away in a separate folder.\nVisual Intelligence: Similar to a reverse Google image search, this new feature will allow you to search for anything that's on your iPhone screen. For instance, if you spot a pair of shoes someone is wearing in an Instagram photo, you can screenshot it and use Visual Intelligence to find those shoes (or similar ones) online.\nPhotos tabs are back: For anyone who's still frustrated with the Photos changes made last year, you'll be happy to know that your tabs are coming back. Library and Collections will have their own separate spaces so you don't have to scroll to infinity to find what you're looking for.\nFaceTime \"Communication Safety\" feature: A newer addition to iOS 26 appears to be the FaceTime \"Communication Safety\" feature that pauses communications if and when nudity is detected. The feature appears to be a child safety feature that uses on-device detection, thus obviating any cloud-based privacy issues.¬†\nApple's Hold Assist will be nifty for those pesky services that put you on hold for 10 or more minutes. (Apple)\nWhich iPhones will be able to upgrade to iOS 26?\nA few iPhone models that run the current version of iOS ‚Äî iPhone XR, XS and XS Max ‚Äî won't be compatible with the latest upgrade. But any iPhones released in 2019 or later will be eligible for the iOS 26 update.\n\niPhone SE (second generation or later)\niPhone 11\niPhone 11 Pro\niPhone 11 Pro Max\niPhone 12\niPhone 12 mini\niPhone 12 Pro\niPhone 12 Pro Max\niPhone 13\niPhone 13 mini\niPhone 13 Pro\niPhone 13 Pro Max\niPhone 14\niPhone 14 Plus\niPhone 14 Pro\niPhone 14 Pro Max\niPhone 15\niPhone 15 Plus\niPhone 15 Pro\niPhone 15 Pro Max\niPhone 16e\niPhone 16\niPhone 16 Plus\niPhone 16 Pro\niPhone 16 Pro Max\n\nNot listed here are the presumed new iPhone 17 models (or maybe iPhone 26?) that are all but certain to be announced and released in September.¬†\nHow to install iOS 26 beta\nThe iOS 26 public beta is now available to download via the Apple Beta Software Program. If you're not already a member, you'll need to sign up to try out all the latest features. Just visit beta.apple.com and sign up with your phone number or email address. It's free.\nOnce you're in, you can install it by going to Settings > General > Software Update and selecting iOS 26 public beta.\nA word of caution: Don't sign up with your main iPhone unless you're OK with any risks that occur with using an OS that isn't finalized.\nWhen will the final version of iOS 26 be released?\niOS 26 will be released to the public this fall. It usually comes in September, within a week of the Apple iPhone event. Last year, it rolled out to iPhone users on September 16 ‚Äî exactly one week after the iPhone 16 lineup was announced.\nIf you're more interested in the Apple Intelligence features coming, here's everything Apple revealed for iOS, macOS and more during WWDC. Also, check out how iOS 26 screenshots could be an intriguing preview of Apple's delayed Siri rework.\nUpdate, July 31: Noted that iOS 18.6 is now available.¬†\nUpdate, July 24: Noted the iOS 26 public beta is now available.\nUpdate, July 3: Noted new FaceTime feature found in the developer beta.\nUpdate, June 30: Noted ongoing iOS 18 releases, and reports that Apple is considering additional external LLMs for Siri.¬†\nUpdate, June 25: Noted changes added in iOS 26 beta 2.¬†This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/ios-26-beta-release-heres-everything-you-need-to-know-about-new-apple-features-and-how-to-get-it-on-your-iphone-135749519.html?src=rss",

A haunt attraction goes terribly wrong in Hell House LLC. Hell House LLC starts with how things ended, which means that as you watch everything happening, you know it's all going to end in tragedy. When Sara arrives at the interview, she brings tapes that have never been seen before. While things are initially a little campy with a pack of 20-somethings exploring the hotel and discussing their plans, things quickly begin to go south. Sara and her friends aren't immune either, as they each begin to be affected by the house. I won't spoil the third act when events ramp up from extremely creepy to blood-curdling. Hell House LLC has reached cult classic status for good reason, and it's one of those horror movies I play on repeat."

Venus and Jupiter don't make an appearance until much later in the evening, but they'll be visible with the naked eye. The other three will require some sort of magnification.

According to The Old Farmer's Almanac, sturgeon were a staple food for Native Americans in the Great Lakes region, and the fish used to be a lot more abundant during mid- to late summer.

    "full_text": "In Brief Google lost its appeal of a judge‚Äôs court order requiring the tech giant to revamp its app store in an antitrust case filed by Fortnite maker Epic Games, Reuters reported on Thursday. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected Google‚Äôs argument that the trial judge made legal errors in the antitrust case that unfairly favored Epic Games. Epic Games first filed its lawsuit in 2020 and was able to convince a jury in 2023 that Google illegally stifled competition. The trial judge ordered Google last October to open its app store to rivals and give Android users more choice when it comes to downloading apps. The order was on hold pending the outcome of Google‚Äôs appeal. Google argued to the appeals court that its Play Store competes with Apple‚Äôs App Store, and claimed that the trial judge unfairly prevented it from presenting that argument in defense against Epic‚Äôs antitrust claims."

Google has launched a new AI model called AlphaEarth Foundations, which can take images and measurements from satellites and other sources to create current and accurate digital representations of lands and waters. With all this data, scientists and researchers can monitor problems like water scarcity, deforestation and crop health. Google says AlphaEarth's AI modeling has already been helpful. \"Our partners are already seeing significant benefits, using the data to better classify unmapped ecosystems, understand agricultural and environmental changes, and greatly increase the accuracy and speed of their mapping work,\" the Google DeepMind blog said Wednesday. Satellites deliver a treasure trove of data every day, but all this information varies in its modalities -- such as satellite, radar, simulations and laser mapping -- and how current it is. AlphaEarth can integrate all that data and \"weaves all this information together to analyze the world's land and coastal waters in sharp, 10x10 meter squares.\" AlphaEarth also creates summaries for each of these squares that \"require 16 times less storage space than those produced by other AI systems that we tested and dramatically reduces the cost of planetary-scale analysis,\" Google said. Scientists \"no longer have to rely on a single satellite passing overhead.\""

    "summary": "Over the past few weeks, thousands of video games have been banned, removed and delisted from Steam and Itch.io. The justifications for doing so have been almost comically vague, and at least one highly anticipated title is now unable to be sold despite containing nothing objectionable.\nIt started in early July, when payment processors including Visa, Mastercard and PayPal established new regulations concerning the types of games they would allow to be sold on the PC gaming platforms they support. The exact details of these regulations have not been made public. What we do know is that, in response on July 16, Steam added a sweepingly vague clause to its ruleset banning ‚Äúcertain kinds of adult only content.‚Äù Hundreds of games were removed from the platform. On July 24, Itch.io rolled out its own rule change and summarily deindexed every adult and NSFW game it hosted, which amounted to more than 20,000 titles being hidden from search and browse pages. Itch.io is currently auditing this bunch and preparing to introduce new compliance measures for NSFW games.\nAmong the games swept up in this tidal wave of censorship is VILE: Exhumed, the latest project from solo developer Cara Cadaver of Final Girl Games and publisher DreadXP.\n\nVILE: Exhumed takes place in the files and preserved BBS chatrooms of an old PC, as players hunt for clues in the disappearance of adult film actress Candy Corpse. It‚Äôs an unsettling psychological experience that‚Äôs mainly text-based, and it offers pixelated commentary on misogyny, sexual entitlement and parasocial relationships. VILE: Exhumed has been praised in multiple previews, even earning a place in Six One Indie‚Äôs Best of PAX East lineup this May. It was slated to hit Steam on July 22.\nAs DreadXP director Hunter Bond and his team continued preparing the game for launch, they noticed it was taking an abnormally long time for Steam to approve its page. They submitted tickets to Steam asking for a status update, but heard nothing concrete back. The day before VILE: Exhumed was supposed to come out, Cara and DreadXP were forced to announce a delay. And On July 28, Cara announced VILE: Exhumed had been removed from Steam and banned from the platform.\nSteam told Cara that the action was triggered by scenes of ‚Äúsexual content with depictions of real people,‚Äù a description that she said doesn‚Äôt apply to her game, since it deals in text and implication. The ban is not eligible for appeal and VILE: Exhumed can not be resubmitted to Steam. This effectively removes it from the mainstream PC gaming conversation, since Steam essentially enjoys a monopoly in the market and there isn‚Äôt a competing storefront with the same audience reach in town. Losing Steam access is a huge blow for small developers especially.\nVILE: Exhumed is a deeply personal project for Cara, one that she worked on for years. ‚ÄúI poured myself into this game ‚Äî it was an incredibly personal story, made up of bits and pieces of my real-life experiences, my real feelings, and was reflective of that for many other people as well,\" Cara told Engadget. \"Silencing a story about violence, entitlement and sexual expression (though the sexual content was all implied) shows the age we are living in, and I deeply worry for storytelling and art.‚Äù\nCara Cadaver\nTo put it clearly: Steam removed a solo female developer‚Äôs game about misogynistic violence and banned her from attempting to list it ever again, and the platform‚Äôs reason for doing so doesn‚Äôt make sense to anyone who knows what‚Äôs actually in the game. You can decide that for yourself, too: At least one full playthrough of VILE: Exhumed lives happily on YouTube, a site not known for tolerant views on nudity or adult themes. More confusingly, the original version of Cara‚Äôs game, VILE, remains available and searchable on Itch.io's storefront, even though it includes much of the same content as Exhumed.\nThis highlights a core issue with Steam and Itchi.io‚Äôs sudden and haphazard censorship plans. Vague rules against ‚Äúadult-only content‚Äù leave too much room for interpretation and invite overreach ‚Äî especially in a society that‚Äôs increasingly hostile to marginalized communities ‚Äî while simultaneously doing very little to protect the audience from whatever demons the payment processors think they have identified. The rollout of the new regulations has been chaotic and already multiple games, including the horror hit Mouthwashing, have been inaccurately identified as casualties of the situation.\nEngadget has reached out to Visa, Mastercard and PayPal for information on what their new policies are and why they're being enacted. Only PayPal has responded with a generic statement that it does not comment on individual accounts. Valve has also not returned requests for comment. Itch.io did not respond to a request for comment in time for publication.\nCara Cadaver\nThis isn‚Äôt the first time Visa, Mastercard, PayPal and other major payment processors have targeted online communities for censorship. The current PC gaming bans mirror previous efforts to restrict content on PornHub, OnlyFans and Patreon, to name a few targets. This sort of financial censorship, the Electronic Frontier Foundation says, \"can heavily influence what kind of speech can exist online.‚Äù\nThe International Game Developers Association has lodged its fierce opposition to the censorship campaign, and provides avenues for players to contact Visa and Mastercard directly with their concerns.\n‚ÄúWe are alarmed by the vague enforcement of policies delisting and deplatforming legal, consensual, and ethically-developed games, especially from LGBTQ+ and marginalized creators,‚Äù the IGDA said. ‚ÄúDevelopers deserve clear rules, fair warnings, and the right to appeal.‚Äù\nIn the case of VILE: Exhumed, Steam is silencing a game that can help combat gender-based sexual violence, in the name of protecting players from being harmed by these same themes. VILE: Exhumed is uncomfortable, confronting, personal and raw ‚Äî and that‚Äôs the beauty of small, independent games. By all accounts, it doesn‚Äôt belong in the Steam ban, and it‚Äôs also likely not the only game unfairly swept up in the broad censorship campaigns hitting PC platforms, pushed by payment processors.\n\"Indie development for me has been such a beautiful opportunity to create things and tell stories that mean something to me ‚Äî and I hate that that freedom of expression is being taken from myself and others,\" Cara said. She and DreadXP are cooking up a new distribution plan that doesn‚Äôt include Steam.\n\nHave a tip for Jessica? You can reach her by email, Bluesky or send a message to @jesscon.96 to chat confidentially on Signal.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/vile-exhumed-is-an-unjust-casualty-in-steams-sweeping-censorship-campaign-170203493.html?src=rss",

This is the first time we're seeing a version of the original title on a Nintendo platform since the DS.\n\nThis is more than just a simple HD refresh. The graphics have been upscaled, which is nice, but EA has also added new levels and plenty of secrets to uncover. The refresh will even include local co-op and PvP, which should be fun. The PSN and Xbox Live Arcade versions of the game, released in the early 2010s, had a co-op mode, but not's not true of many other iterations.\nPreorders are open right now, and early birds will receive a retro Peashooter skin when the game launches. It remains to be seen if the game will come to other platforms beyond Nintendo's hybrid consoles. However, it's very likely to pop up on just about everything before too long.\n\nAs for the rest of today's Nintendo Direct, it was a muted affair focusing on third-party titles. Square Enix announced a new Octopath Traveler game and Atlus revealed that Persona 3 Reload is coming to Switch 2.

In survival mode, you'll have a limited stock of firewood and have to figure out how to pass the flame between logs to keep it burning. There's also a multiplayer feature called Playground, in which you can compete with friends to construct the biggest fire (messing with them is an option here) or work together.\nChillin' by the Fire supports GameShare, so you only need one copy to play with up to three other people online (they'll each need a Switch 2) or locally (on separate Switch or Switch 2 systems). It supports GameChat as well, so you can have you and your buddies' heads hanging out by the fire, where you can roast marshmallows, set off fireworks or carry out the time-honored tradition of telling spooky campfire stories (Are You Afraid of the Dark?-style) as your heads hover in the air.\nIt all seems quite lovely, in truth. These days, I like the idea of camping more than actually camping. No, thank you. Too many bugs. So, Chillin' by the Fire seems right up my alley.

    "summary": "Brilliant Labs is the startup behind Frame, the open-source smart glasses designed for hackers and other creative types. Today, the company is launching Halo, a new pair of glasses that, predictably for the age we live in, are being sold on the back of their AI features. Halo is a wayfarer-style pair (compared to the Panto-styled Frame) and, if you‚Äôre a spectacles wearer, you‚Äôll be able to get prescription lenses in more than 100 countries thank to a partnership with SmartBuyGlasses.\nBrilliant is happy to brag that Halo includes a camera, microphone and bone-conduction speakers in its slender chassis. A natural pitfall of many smart glasses has been the compromises necessary to keep weight down while still offering enough functionality to be useful. Being able to keep the weight to a trim 40 grams is one hell of an achievement, especially given the glasses have a color OLED display and a battery that promises to run for 14 hours on a single charge.\nUnfortunately, instead of a display that overlays onto the lens, Halo \"works\" by projecting into your peripheral vision. I‚Äôll be honest, these displays are becoming more of an irritation the more I use them, especially compared to models that have prisms inside the lenses.\nLast year, Brilliant introduced Noa, its AI agent which it said was designed from the ground up to be used within the context of a pair of glasses. The company says that, when paired with Halo, Noa will be able to talk to you in a way that is natural and intuitive, as if ‚Äúspeaking with a real person.‚Äù It claims the secret sauce is in the fact Noa will be able to ‚Äúunderstand what it hears and sees within its environment and responds with contextually relevant information in real time.‚Äù\nThat‚Äôs a lot of braggadocio, especially given the promises that come next about Narrative, its agentic memory system. Narrative will, so it is said, remember the name of a person you met or the details of a conversation you‚Äôve had ‚Äúyears or even decades later.‚Äù This will harness the glasses‚Äô optical sensors and microphones to keep tabs on what‚Äôs going on from your point of view. And since audio and video are both being constantly recorded, the system will build a ‚Äúprivate and personalized knowledge base‚Äù about you.\nNaturally, a pair of AI-enabled smart glasses will raise privacy hackles, and Brilliant says Noa will act as a VPN between you and the AI model behind it. Your interactions will be private by default, and users will get a lot of fine-grain privacy controls to ensure they‚Äôre happy with how much data they share. Plus, you‚Äôll have voice commands to turn off the microphone, camera and the glasses themselves should you need to. Although if you‚Äôre doing something you‚Äôd rather not be recorded, the smartest advice is to not wear a pair of AI glasses in the first place. Not to mention that your general concerns about having a database built of every single thing you do in a day (and your social graph) is likely to be easily de-anonymized if necessary.\nBrilliant also promises Halo will enable users to build custom applications for their glasses just from natural language commands. The company says that you just need to tell Noa what you need, and it‚Äôll build an app to serve your purpose ‚Äúwithin seconds.‚Äù\nPre-orders for Halo are opening today, but shipping isn‚Äôt due to begin until late November 2025, with the price set at $299. Compatible prescription lenses will be available to purchase through SmartBuyGlasses, too. The company is also taking great pains to tell users that it will, again, be releasing a limited number of pairs and so anyone interested in owning one will need to get in the line.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wearables/brilliant-labs-launches-its-second-generation-smart-glasses-130000032.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "DJI is finally taking on rising rival Insta360 with its first panoramic action camera, the Osmo 360. The company dug into its deep engineering toolkit in an effort to one-up the competition with features like a new sensor design, up to 8K 50 fps 10-bit log recording and a smaller, lighter body.\nIt also matches or beats its rival in other areas, with similar battery life and superior low-light capability. After testing the device in various scenarios like riding around on an e-bike, I‚Äôm impressed. Like other 360 cameras, though, the Osmo 360 sacrifices video quality for the convenience of unlimited angles. Plus, DJI‚Äôs editing app still needs some work. \n\n\nDesign and features\nInsta360‚Äôs cameras made a splash in the action cam world because of a then-unique trait: they capture footage from all angles. That lets you reframe video in any direction so you‚Äôre not stuck with a traditional camera's forward-only view. The downside is that quality is reduced from the stated resolution (from 8K to 4K, for example) when footage is \"de-warped\" or flattened to create the final video.\nDJI has so far stayed out of this category, but that's changed with the Osmo 360. Like rival models, it has a lens and sensor on each side, with a display at the back and a record and camera view button below (just like Insta360). There‚Äôs also a power button on the side. Other settings and controls are operated from the screen or a smartphone via DJI's Mimo app.\nA key feature is the new 1-inch square sensor designed specifically for panoramic shooting. That allowed DJI to use 25 percent more of the sensor than rival models with rectangular chips, in turn boosting image quality and low-light capability. It also makes the camera more power-efficient.\nThe Osmo 360 is a bit smaller than Insta360's latest model, the X5. Though a bit thicker and wider, the Osmo is substantially shorter at just 83mm compared to the X5 (124.5mm). It's also about 9 percent lighter at 183 grams. All that makes it slightly easier to carry and attach to your body, bikes or other things, though it's still bulkier than a regular action cam.\nAnother bonus with the Osmo 360 is the 105GB of usable built-in storage (plus a microSD slot), compared to‚Ä¶ zero for the competition. The battery is the same as the one in the Osmo Action 4 Pro and 5 Pro, so owners of those models already have a compatible battery. It supports up to 120 minutes of 8K 30 fps recording in endurance mode, or 100 minutes in regular mode, similar to the X5's 93/115 minutes. On top of that, battery life on the Osmo 360 can be boosted to 180 minutes with an optional battery extension rod.\nVideo and audio\n\n\n\n\n  DJI\n \n\nWith its new sensor, the Osmo 360 can produce the highest quality video in the 360 category at up to 8K 50 fps, compared to 8K 30 fps on the Insta360 X5 and 6K 30 fps on the Insta360 One RS. That in turn lets creators capture high-quality flat (de-warped) video at up to 4K 50 fps. The new model also offers 10-bit D-LogM recording to boost dynamic range, which is better than the X5's 8-bit I-Log. And if you'd rather record flat video, you can do that in single-lens \"Boost Video\" mode at 4K 120 fps, with a field of view up to 170 degrees.\nWhat's more, I was able to continuously capture 8K at 50 fps for nearly 90 minutes (8K at 30 fps for just over 100 minutes) without any overheating or other issues. That's impressive considering the size of the camera and amount of data being pushed through it.\nThe other benefit is improved low-light capability in all modes. DJI says that the native 8K pixel size is 2.4 micrometers, twice that of the X5, allowing for increased light gathering. If you want to take panoramic photos, the Osmo 360 beats the competition there as well with up to 120MP photos (compared to 72MP for the X5), or it can bin four pixels down to one for 30MP photos with lower noise in low light.\nAfter testing it in day and night conditions, I‚Äôm impressed. In good light, it was on par with Insta360's X5 in terms of sharpness and color accuracy. It was superior in tricky contrasty situations, though, with the D-LogM profile boosting dynamic range. Skies, shiny roads and other brightly lit objects showed more detail than the 8-bit I-log video shot with the X5 and shadows were also less washed out.\n\n\nDJI's digital RockSteady stabilization delivered impressively smooth video, even over rough cobblestone roads. And as with other DJI devices, you can let the camera bank with your movements or keep the horizon level (HorizonSteady), although that will come at the cost of some resolution. Stitching was also seamless (except occasionally with objects close to the camera), so I could choose any angle without worrying about distortion.\nNot all was perfect though. As with other 360 models, the Osmo 360 is clearly less sharp than DJI's Action 5 Pro after conversion to 4K flat video. And while low-light performance was indeed very good, digital stabilization became problematic when shooting at night, showing signs of pixelation and video tearing due to motion blur. However, that‚Äôs a problem that‚Äôs typical with all action cams since they lack optical stabilization.\nLike other DJI Action cams, the Osmo 360 supports the company's Mic 2 and Mic Mini wireless microphones and can record from two of those at the same time via its OsmoAudio direct connection system. You can also connect third-party wireless earbuds as I did with Samsung's Galaxy Buds Pro 2, though only one set at a time.\nDJI‚Äôs mics allow for crisp and clear audio, and add a lot of convenience. When paired with the camera, they can also record audio internally to provide a backup copy. Insta360 recently released its own microphone system with the $50 Mic Air that connects directly to the Insta360 X5 and Insta360 Ace Pro 2. However, those models can only use one mic at a time rather than two like the Osmo 360.\nDJI Studio editing\n\n\n\n\n  Steve Dent for Engadget\n \n\nSoftware is an important component of panoramic cameras. On top of editing, they help creators change camera angles and do 360-specific moves. And if you plan to output full panoramic content, it injects that metadata into the final video so that apps like Facebook and YouTube will recognize it correctly.\nA big reason for Insta360‚Äôs success has been its excellent Studio app that helps users do all of those things. DJI‚Äôs response to that is a new app of its own, which is also called Studio, but its first crack at a 360 editor doesn‚Äôt quite measure up to its rival.\nDJI Studio does let you do basic editing, like inserting shots and trimming them. However, it‚Äôs not the most intuitive process ‚Äî it took me too long to figure out how to trim shots before inserting them into the timeline. It‚Äôs also a bit buggy: the source display tends to show shots you haven‚Äôt selected and the camera angles sometimes randomly change. It also lacks features found on Insta360 Studio like text overlays and transitions.\nThat said, DJI Studio does a good job with its most important task. It‚Äôs easy to switch to a new view using keyframes and set animations to improve smoothness. You can then export video in either flat or panoramic formats and import it into apps like Premiere Pro or DaVinci Resolve for the final color correction, effects and titles. All told, DJI Studio is good for a first release, but still needs work compared to its main rival.\nWrap-up\n\n\n\n\n  Steve Dent for Engadget\n \n\nIt took DJI awhile to get a panoramic action cam into the market, but the Osmo 360 was worth the wait. It stacks up well against its main rival, Insta360‚Äôs X5, by offering better video quality in low light or high-contrast situations. It‚Äôs also easy to use, offers good battery life and trumps its competition with a large amount of built-in storage.\nThe primary drawbacks are slightly lower image quality compared to regular action cams and stabilization that breaks down a bit in low light. The all-new DJI Studio app also needs some work. For a first effort, though, the Osmo 360 is a surprisingly solid rival to Insta360‚Äôs X5.\nDJI's Osmo 360 is now available nearly everywhere but the US at ‚Ç¨480 for the Standard Combo (around $554) which includes a single battery, protective pouch and rubber lens protector, or ‚Ç¨630 ($728) for the Adventure Combo which adds two extra batteries, a charger, a quick release adapter mount and a 1.2m Invisible Selfie Stick. As for US availability, \"it will not be available for sale immediately in the U.S. market through official DJI channels,\" a DJI spokesperson told Engadget. \"We currently do not have an estimated timeline‚Ä¶ but we will let you know when we do.\"\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cameras/dji-osmo-360-review-a-capable-action-cam-thats-a-real-threat-to-insta360-120019592.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "We all have so many gadgets now that we use and take with us regularly, and there's a good chance that at least a few of yours support wireless charging. Whether its your phone, wireless earbuds, smartwatch or all three of those things, you can power them up cord-free using a good wireless charger. And if you do plan to rely on wireless power-ups for your most-used devices, a multi-device wireless charger is a good investment. These accessories neatly charge up more than one device simultaneously, without using a bunch of cables that can mess up your space. We've tested a bunch of the latest multi-device wireless chargers; you‚Äôll find out top picks below for the best wireless charging pads, plus some advice on how to choose the right one for your needs.\nTable of contents\n\nBest wireless charging pads\nDo wireless charging pads work with any phone or device?\nHow to pick the best wireless charging pad for your needs\nWireless charging speed and performance\n\nBest wireless charging pads\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDo wireless charging pads work with any phone or device?\nThe short answer is no, but the long and more detailed answer starts with it depends. Regular old wireless charging pucks should work with any device that‚Äôs compatible with the same wireless charging standard that the charger supports. Smartphones and other mobile devices that support wireless charging nowadays are likely to support the Qi standard, so double check that your phone or gadget fits that bill and it should work with any Qi wireless charging pad (all of our top picks fall into this category). \nWhen it comes to multi-device chargers, things can get a little tricky. Rather than starting your search looking for the most universally adaptable accessory, consider the devices you have and aspire to own in the future. If you‚Äôre an iPhone user with an Apple Watch, you may want to look for a wireless charger that has a Watch pad built in. Ditto if you‚Äôre a Samsung phone owner and use a Galaxy Watch. Some earbuds support wireless charging, but you‚Äôll only need an open pad or space on your multi-device charger where you can sit the earbuds in their case down for a power-up.\nThose with iPhone 12s and newer Apple smartphones can take advantage of MagSafe chargers, which magnetically attach to their handsets. Android devices don‚Äôt support Apple‚Äôs proprietary MagSafe technology, but you can buy a magnetic adapter for pretty cheap that will allow your Samsung or Pixel phone to work with MagSafe multi-device chargers. You‚Äôll also need that to get full Qi2 goodness with newer Android phones like the Galaxy S25 series, which are ‚ÄúQi2 ready,‚Äù but since they do not have magnets built in, aren‚Äôt precisely Qi2 compliant.\nHow to pick the best wireless charging pad for your needs\n\n\n\n\nEven without a charging cable to worry about, you‚Äôre probably buying a multi-device wireless charger with one location in mind. It might sit on your nightstand or on your desk. Not everyone buys a charger just for themselves, though; you might want to use one as a shared station for you and a partner.\nIf the charger will sit on your nightstand, you‚Äôll likely want a compact, stable unit that won‚Äôt swallow all your free space or tumble to the floor (and if it does fall, one with enough durability to survive). Some may prefer a lay-flat design if your phone screen has a tendency to keep you awake at night. Others might use their phone as their alarm clock, in which case you may want a stand that keeps the screen within reach and eyeshot. This is also the preferred design if you use Standby Mode on iPhones.\nA vertical orientation may be best for a charger that lives on your desk so you can more easily check notifications throughout the day. Will the charger sit on a low table? Horizontal charger pads may make it easier to grab your devices in a hurry. Travel chargers should fold up or otherwise protect the pads while they‚Äôre in your bag. And, yes, aesthetics count. You may want something pretty if it‚Äôs likely to sit in a posh room where guests will see it.\nFor vehicles, consider a wireless car charger if you frequently need to top off your device on the go. These chargers combine convenience with functionality, ensuring your phone stays powered while you‚Äôre navigating and taking calls at the same time. We also heavily recommend a magnetic charger so there‚Äôs less of a chance your phone will go flying into the passenger‚Äôs seat the next time you hit a pothole.\nWireless charging speed and performance\nIt‚Äôs no secret that wireless charging is slower than wired, and powering multiple devices adds a new wrinkle. As these chargers often have to support a wide range of hardware, you‚Äôll have to forget about the fastest, device-specific options from brands like Google, OnePlus and Samsung.\nThat‚Äôs not to say these will be slow, but there just isn‚Äôt much separating them on the charging speed front. As a general rule, the quickest multi-device chargers tend to top out at 15W for phones. It‚Äôs rare that you‚Äôll find a truly slow-as-molasses example, mind you. Even some of the most affordable options we‚Äôve seen will recharge your phone at a reasonable 7.5W or 10W, and the 5W for other devices like wireless earbuds is more than enough.\nIf you‚Äôre only docking overnight or while you work, speed won‚Äôt make a huge difference. Just be sure that whatever you buy is powerful enough for a phone in a case. Some chargers may also include an AC adapter in the box. If not, make sure you‚Äôre using one with the right power level to get the fastest charge.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-multi-device-wireless-charging-pads-120557582.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Whether you're listening to playlists on your daily commute or zoning out with a podcast at home, wireless headphones can make your audio experience much more comfortable. With no cords to untangle or get caught on your bag, they‚Äôre a great pick for anyone who wants convenience without compromising on sound quality. If comfort and immersive audio are high on your priority list, over-ear wireless headphones are often the way to go ‚Äî they wrap around your ears to help block out the world and deliver rich detailed sound that earbuds can sometimes miss.There‚Äôs a wide range of over-ear wireless headphones to choose from, whether you want active noise cancellation, long battery life or a comfy fit for marathon listening sessions. Of course, if you're after something a little more compact or tailored to a specific use case, we also have you covered with our buying guides for the best earbuds, the best gaming headsets and the best budget earbuds. But if wireless headphones with top-tier sound and a comfortable, over-ear design are what you're after, read on ‚Äî we‚Äôve tested the top options to help you find the right pair.\nTable of contents\n\nBest wireless headphones for 2025\nHow to choose the best wireless headphones for you\nHow we test over-ear headphones\nOther wireless headphones we tested\nWireless headphones FAQs\n\nBest wireless headphones for 2025\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nHow to choose the best wireless headphones for you\nWhen it comes to shopping for a good pair of wireless headphones, the first thing you‚Äôll need to decide on is wear style. Do you prefer on-ear or over-ear headphones? For the purposes of our buyer‚Äôs guide, we focus on the over-ear style as that‚Äôs what most noise-canceling headphones are nowadays. Sure, you can find on-ear models with ANC, but over-ear designs are much more effective at blocking sound. Speaking of noise cancellation, you‚Äôll want to determine early on if you even want that. If you frequently crank up the beats in noisy environments, you‚Äôll want to not only make sure it‚Äôs there, but also make sure it‚Äôs good, preferably with adaptive ANC. If you plan to use your new headphones in quieter spaces, skipping ANC can save you some money. \nThe next area to consider is features. We recommend trying to get the most bang for your buck, but as you‚Äôre shopping around you should determine which items are must-haves and what you can live without. And don‚Äôt take basic things like automatic pausing and Bluetooth multipoint connectivity for granted, as not all companies include them. We also suggest reading reviews to see how well a company‚Äôs more advanced features work. This will help you decide if those are something you‚Äôre willing to (likely) pay extra for. Keep an eye on better battery life estimates to avoid disappointment, as some manufacturers promise more hours than real-world testing delivers. And don‚Äôt be easily swayed by lofty promises about call quality without verifying them.\nSound can be subjective, so we recommend trying before you buy if at all possible. We understand this isn‚Äôt easy at a time when we‚Äôre doing most of our shopping online. But trying on a set of headphones and listening to them for a few minutes can save you from an expensive case of buyer‚Äôs remorse. We also recommend paying attention to things like Spatial Audio, Dolby Atmos, 360 Reality Audio and other immersive formats. Not all headphones support them, so you‚Äôll want to make sure a perspective pair does if that sort of thing excites you. If you plan to use your headphones for other media besides music, checking for latency is also a must ‚Äî some delay can impact playback for things like movies or games, even if most true wireless headphones now offer minimal lag.\nHow we test over-ear headphones\nThe primary way we test wireless headphones is to wear them as much as possible. We prefer to do this over a one- to two-week period, but sometimes embargoes don‚Äôt allow it. During this time, we listen to a mix of music and podcasts, while also using the earbuds to take both voice and video calls. Since battery life for headphones can be 30 hours or more, we drain the battery with looping music and the volume set at a comfortable level (usually around 75 percent). Due to the longer battery estimates, we‚Äôll typically power the headphones off several times and leave them during a review. This simulates real-world use and keeps us from having to constantly monitor the process for over 24 straight hours.\nTo judge the best Bluetooth headphones, we focus on higher-quality audio by listening to a variety of genres and paying close attention to how each style sounds. We also test at both low and high volumes to check for consistency in the tuning. To assess the quality of phone calls, we‚Äôll record audio samples with the headphones‚Äô microphones as well as have third parties call us.\nWhen it comes to features, we do a thorough review of companion apps, testing each feature as we work through the software. Any holdovers from previous models are double checked for improvements or regression. If the headphones we‚Äôre testing are an updated version of a previous model, we‚Äôll spend time getting reacquainted with the older set. Ditto for the closest competition for each new set of headphones that we review.\nOther wireless headphones we tested\nAirPods Max\nApple‚Äôs AirPods Max are premium, well-designed over-ear headphones that incorporate all of the best features you find on standard AirPods: solid noise cancelation, spatial audio and easy Siri access. However, their $550 starting price makes them almost prohibitively expensive, even for Apple users. There are better options available at lower prices, but if you can pick up the AirPods Max at a steep discount, they might be worthwhile for the biggest Apple fans among us.\nDyson On-Trac\nThe On-Trac headphones have an almost infinitely customizable design, and that‚Äôs what‚Äôs most unique about them. The sound profile offers some nice detail, but lacks dynamic range overall. ANC is average at best and there aren‚Äôt any advanced features that will make your life easier. Well, except for the hearing health monitor which is actually handy. All told, that‚Äôs not a lot in a set of $500 headphones.\nSonos Ace\nThe Sonos Ace is an excellent debut for the company‚Äôs first headphones. The combination of refined design, great sound quality and home theater tricks creates a unique formula. However, ANC performance is just okay and key functionality is still in the works for many users.\nSony ULT Wear\nIf most headphones don‚Äôt have the level of bass you desire, the ULT Wear is an option to consider. The low-end thump isn‚Äôt for everyone, but there are also plenty of handy features and a refined look to make the $200 set more compelling than many in this price range.\nSony WH-CH720N\nWhile the WH-CH720N are a great affordable option, we prefer the Audio-Technica in the budget category. Sony‚Äôs cans are lightweight with good sound quality, but ANC struggles at times and they‚Äôre made with a lot of plastic.\nBeats Studio Pro\nThe Studio Pro lacks basic features like automatic pausing, and multipoint connectivity is only available on Android. Moreover, they‚Äôre not very comfortable for people with larger heads. Overall sound quality is improved, though, and voice performance on calls is well above average.\nBose QuietComfort Ultra headphones\nBose‚Äôs latest flagship model has a lot to offer, but its trademark Immersive Audio feature can be inconsistent across different types of music. There‚Äôs still world-class ANC, excellent comfort and a clearer transparency mode, but for the price, the non-Ultra model is a better choice right now.\nMaster & Dynamic MH40 (2nd gen)\nThe MH40 are a great set of headphones if you favor crisp, clear and natural sound that isn‚Äôt overly tuned. This pair showcases the company‚Äôs affinity for leather and metal too, but limited customization and short battery life for non-ANC cans kept this set from making the cut.\nBowers & Wilkins Px8\nThe company‚Äôs trademark pristine sound is on display here, but the Px8 are more expensive and not nearly as comfortable as the Px7 S2.\nWireless headphones FAQs\nHow can you tell the quality of wireless headphones?\nI typically look at three factors: design, sound quality and features. In terms of design, I‚Äôm usually looking to see if the build quality of the headphones feels cheap and plasticky. Plenty of companies use plastic, but they can do so in a way that doesn‚Äôt look or feel like budget models. For sound quality, I want to hear a nice, even tuning where highs, mids and lows are all well represented. No overly boomy bass or scooped out mids. I also want good clarity where you can pick up fine details and an open, immersive soundstage. Features is typically a distant third, but if a company doesn‚Äôt cover basic functionality (automatic pausing, transparency mode, multipoint Bluetooth, etc.) it can be an indication of overall quality.¬†\nHow do I choose the best quality wireless headphones?\n‚ÄúBest‚Äù can be pretty subjective, but I always recommend going to a place where you can listen to the headphones you‚Äôre thinking about buying before you commit. Sometimes this isn‚Äôt possible, so you‚Äôll want to check return policies. I also recommend doing some research to determine what your priorities are in a new set. Are you an audiophile who wants the best sound quality? Is powerful active noise cancellation (ANC) the most important? Would you rather have conveniences like automatic pausing?\nWhich brand has the best wireless headphones?\nSony consistently tops our list with its 1000X line. This is mostly due to the combination of sound quality, ANC performance and the truckload of features these headphones pack in. I‚Äôll be the first to tell you that there are better sounding options and other companies, like Bose, offer more effective noise cancellation. But when you add everything up, no one comes close to the full slate of tools Sony puts in its premium headphone line.\nDo expensive wireless headphones sound better?\nExorbitant price tags don‚Äôt mean better audio quality. Bowers & Wilkins‚Äô headphones are on the high end for wireless noise-canceling models and they sound amazing. However, Audio-Technica‚Äôs M50xBT2 is much more affordable and doesn‚Äôt have ANC, but these headphones have a warm, natural sound profile that I find very inviting. At the end of the day, it will come down to personal preference, but you don‚Äôt need to spend a lot to find great headphones.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/best-headphones-wireless-bluetooth-120543205.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "\niPhone devotees, listen up: Tons of new updates are coming to Apple's operating system this fall that you'll be excited to try out. But instead of being named iOS 19, it'll be called iOS 26. The biggest change? The new Liquid Glass design (think Windows Vista, but arguably more thoughtful), which looks to be Apple's largest visual update in years. We spent two weeks test-driving it ‚Äî you can check out our detailed hands-on iOS 26 preview, or you can try it out yourself by downloading and installing the public beta, available now. Before you dive in, we'll help you answer this question: Will my iPhone be able to run iOS 26?\nLast year, Apple didn't nix any iPhones from its eligibility list, but that's not the case for 2025 ‚Äî a few models are getting cut this time. All iPhone 8 models and the iPhone X were the last to get the boot in 2023, and this year the 2018 models are getting left behind. If you have an ineligible device, you won't be able to download iOS 26 when it becomes available this fall.\nWe'll get to the bottom of which iPhones will support iOS 26 this year. To see what's coming with the latest OS and more, check out everything announced at Apple's WWDC June 9 event.¬†\nThese three iPhones won't be compatible with iOS 26\nUnlike last year, several iPhone models won't be eligible to download the newest iOS when it makes its debut this fall. This trio of models first released in 2018 won't be coming to the iOS 26 party:\n\niPhone XR\niPhone XS\niPhone XS Max\n\niPhones compatible with iOS 26\nWhile we don't yet know the new iPhones Apple will be dropping this fall ‚Äî though there are iPhone 17 rumors ‚Äî we do know, per Apple's site, that the phones listed below will be compatible with iOS 26.

However, you'll miss out on security updates which could potentially put your phone at risk for malware and other threats. Additionally, some apps may stop working if they require a certain version of iOS or later. And of course, you won't be able to access the latest features iOS 26 offers.\nWhen will iOS 26 become available?\nApple usually rolls out its latest iOS in mid-September, just a few days before the new iPhones hit store shelves. Last year, it released iOS 18 on Monday, Sept. 16. Expect a confirmation of the release date at the iPhone 17 event, expected in early September.¬†\niOS 26 features we're excited about\nLiquid Glass design: Your home screen is getting revamped with new app icons, including dark mode and all-clear options. You'll also notice buttons with a new floating design. Liquid Glass was designed to make all of Apple's OSes more cohesive.\nPhone app redesign: You'll finally be able to scroll through contacts, recent calls and voicemail messages all on one screen. It also comes with a new feature called Hold Assist that'll notify you when an agent comes to the phone so you can avoid the elevator music.\nLive Translate: iOS 26 is bringing the ability to have a conversation via phone call or text message with someone who speaks another language. Live Translate will translate your conversation in real time.¬†\nPolls feature: Coming to group messages in the Messages app, chat members will be able to create polls. This can help prevent the unwanted 30+ messages when it comes to deciding which restaurant you're meeting at this weekend.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/apple-ios-26-is-your-iphone-compatible-heres-a-list-which-devices-can-download-it-today-191854768.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Earlier today, Mark Zuckerberg shared a rambling memo outlining his vision to build AI \"superintelligence.\" In the memo, Zuckerberg hinted that the pursuit of more powerful AI might require the company to be more selective in what it open sources.\nCiting \"safety concerns\" he wrote that Meta would need to be \"rigorous\" about such decisions. The line stood out to many as Zuckerberg ‚Äî who once said \"fuck that\" in reference to closed platforms ‚Äî has made open source central to Meta's AI strategy.\nDuring Meta's second quarter earnings call, Zuckerberg further acknowledged there could be a shift, though he downplayed the significance of it. Here's what he said when asked if his thinking had changed.\nI don't think that our thinking has particularly changed on this. We've always open sourced some of our models and not open sourced everything that we've done. So I would expect that we will continue to produce and share leading open source models. I also think that there are a couple of trends that are playing out. One is that we're getting models that are so big that they're just not practical for a lot of other people to use, so we kind of wrestle with whether it's productive or helpful to share that, or if that's really just primarily helping competitors or something like that. So I think that there's, there's that concern. And then obviously, as you approach real superintelligence, I think there's a whole different set of safety concerns that I think we need to take very seriously, that I wrote about in my note this morning. But I think the bottom line is I would expect that we will continue open sourcing work. I expect us to continue to be a leader there, and I also expect us to continue to not open source everything that we do, which is a continuation of kind of what we, what we've been, been kind of working on.\nThat's notably different than what he wrote almost exactly a year ago in a different memo titled \"Open Source AI is the Path Forward.\" In that, even longer note, he said that open source is crucial for both Meta and developers.\n\"People often ask if I‚Äôm worried about giving up a technical advantage by open sourcing Llama, but I think this misses the big picture,\" he wrote. \"I expect AI development will continue to be very competitive, which means that open sourcing any given model isn‚Äôt giving away a massive advantage over the next best models at that point in time.\"\nHe also argued that open source is safer. \"There is an ongoing debate about the safety of open source AI models, and my view is that open source AI will be safer than the alternatives. As long as everyone has access to similar generations of models ‚Äì which open source promotes ‚Äì then governments and institutions with more compute resources will be able to check bad actors with less compute.\"\nTo be clear, Zuckerberg said the company would continue to open source some of its work. But he seems to be laying the groundwork for a future in which Meta's \"superintelligence\" could be a lot less open.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/is-mark-zuckerberg-flip-flopping-on-open-source-ai-231310567.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Fable, a startup designing tools to generate animated TV shows from scratch, is launching an AI-powered streaming service this week, Variety reports. The service is called Showrunner, and it will allow subscribers to generate scenes, view content created for Fable's in-house AI-generated animated shows and even insert themselves into the animations they generate.\nShowrunner is launching in alpha, and based on Fable's website, you'll primarily interact with it through the company's Discord to start. Per Variety, subscribers will pay anywhere from $10 to $20 month for credits that can be exchanged for the ability to generate new animated scenes. The word \"scenes\" is key here. While Fable is launching with a couple of distinct animated shows, they're really more like collections of worlds and characters that subscribers can use to create new scenes.¬†\nThose include Exit Valley, a Family Guy-inspired riff on the culture of Silicon Valley, and Everything is Fine, a comedy about a husband and wife who are stranded in an alternate world and trying to reunite. The company's goal is bigger than than just original content. Fable founder Edward Saatchi¬†imagines a Disney-owned \"Toy Story of AI\" where subscribers could generate endless new scenes of Buzz and Woody interacting. For now, though, interested Showrunner users have to settle with knockoffs.\nEngadget was able to preview an earlier version of Fable's Showrunner AI models back in 2019 that capably generated new South Park episodes based on audio inputs. The startup's model was able to create a watchable copy of the show's style even back then, which might be why Amazon has invested an undisclosed amount in Fable as part of the launch of Showrunner.¬†\nWhile creatives remain skeptical to downright antagonist towards AI, companies have started using it more publicly in production. For example, Netflix recently touted its use of generative AI in its original show The Eternaut. Even if adoption grows, though, that doesn't really clarify whether the average film or TV viewer has any desire to generate content on their own, especially if it's as rough-around-the-edges¬†as most AI-generated media is. Besides being a public demonstration of Fable's tech, Showrunner seems like a test to see if that desire is even there.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/showrunner-an-ai-powered-streaming-service-launches-in-alpha-this-week-204042241.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "It was easy to view Substack's 2023 Nazi controversy as a kicked can that could turn up again. Well, white supremacist content led to another headache for the company this week. User Mag reported on Tuesday that the app sent a push alert to some users promoting a Nazi newsletter. The company told Engadget the notification was an \"extremely offensive and disturbing\" error.\nThe Substack newsletter in question describes itself as \"a National Socialist weekly newsletter.\" It includes \"opinions and news important to the National Socialist and White Nationalist Community.\" The far-right blog has a mere 757 subscribers. (That's a drop in the ocean compared to, say, Heather Cox Richardson's 2.6 million, George Saunders' 312,000 and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's 236,000.)\nGiven the newsletter's offensive content and relatively paltry audience, this wouldn't seem like something to promote. According to the company, it didn't mean to. \"We discovered an error that caused some people to receive push notifications they should never have received,\" a Substack spokesperson told Engadget.\n\"In some cases, these notifications were extremely offensive or disturbing,\" the statement continued. \"This was a serious error, and we apologize for the distress it caused. We have taken the relevant system offline, diagnosed the issue and are making changes to ensure it doesn't happen again.\"\nEngadget asked Substack for extra details or context about how the accident happened. It didn't have further comment at the time of publication. We'll update this story if we find out more.\nThe newsletter in questionSubstack\nUser Mag reports that those who clicked on the Nazi blog's profile received recommendations for a similar one. That one had a larger audience of 8,600 subscribers.\nOne reason social users were quick to pounce on the latest incident: It provides a symbolic callback to Substack's 2023 Nazi shitstorm. That's when The Atlantic dug up \"scores\" of white-supremacist, neo-Confederate and Nazi newsletters on the platform. Some were monetized.\nSubstack's policy is one of anti-censorship. \"I just want to make it clear that we don't like Nazis either ‚Äî we wish no one held those views,\" Substack cofounder Hamish McKenzie wrote in December 2023. \"But some people do hold those and other extreme views. Given that, we don't think that censorship (including through demonetizing publications) makes the problem go away ‚Äî in fact, it makes it worse.\"\nAfter weeks of negative press coverage and prominent authors leaving the platform, Substack relented‚Ä¶ sort of. On one hand, the company removed \"some\" pro-Nazi publications. However, it did so without changing its policies. Instead, it said five publications violated its existing content guidelines. Specifically, they broke rules prohibiting \"incitements to violence based on protected classes.\"\nSome critics didn't believe that was enough. The Platformer's Casey Newton, a prominent voice who left Substack during the episode, thought the company needed to take more responsibility. \"Every platform hosts its share of racists, white nationalists and other noxious personalities,\" Newton wrote in early 2024. \"In some very real sense, there is no escaping them online. But there ought to be ways to see them less; to recommend them less; to fund them less. Other platforms have realized this as they‚Äôve grown up. Here‚Äôs hoping Substack does the same.\"\nSubstack has since found its footing as a haven for independent content creators. Numerous journalists looking to build an audience sans traditional media have flocked to it. (Among others, that list includes Tina Brown, Jim Acosta, Terry Moran and Jennifer Rubin.) In recent years, Substack has added a Twitter-like social feature, live video and TikTok-esque vertical video.\nThe company said it had its biggest week during the 2024 presidential election with an 82 percent boost in paid subscriptions. It recently raised $100 million in funding.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/apps/substack-accidentally-sent-push-alerts-promoting-a-nazi-publication-191004115.html?src=rss",

The update, the company's first change in three years according to the site's own changelog, removed a line that stated the company prohibits the misgendering and deadnaming of transgender individuals.\nThe change, which was first noted by the organization Open Terms Archive, was the only modification to the \"hateful and derogatory content\" policy. An archived version of the rules includes \"misgendering or deadnaming of transgender individuals\" as an example of prohibited content under the policy. That line was removed on July 28, 2025.\nOpen Terms and other groups have interpreted the change to mean that LinkedIn is rolling back protections for transgender people.\nA LinkedIn spokesperson told Engadget the company's underlying policies hadn't changed despite the updated wording. The company's rules still reference \"gender identity\" as a protected characteristic. \"We regularly update our policies,\" the company said in a statement. \"Personal attacks or intimidation toward anyone based on their identity, including misgendering, violates our harassment policy and is not allowed on our platform.\" The company didn't provide an explanation for the change.\nAdvocacy groups say they are alarmed by the move. In a statement, GLAAD denounced LinkedIn's update and suggested it was part of a broader pattern of tech platforms loosening rules meant to protect vulnerable users. ‚ÄúLinkedIn‚Äôs quiet decision to retract longstanding, best-practice hate speech protections for transgender and nonbinary people is an overt anti-LGBTQ move ‚Äî and one that should alarm everyone,\" a spokesperson for the organization said in a statement. \"Following Meta and YouTube earlier this year, yet another social media company is choosing to adopt cowardly business practices to try to appease anti-LGBTQ political ideologues at the expense of user safety.\"\nEarlier this year, Meta rewrote its rules to allow its users to claim LGBTQ people are mentally ill. The company also added a term associated with discrimination and dehumanization to its community standards and has so far declined to remove it even after its Oversight Board recommended it do so. YouTube also quietly updated its rules this year to remove a reference to \"gender identity\" from its hate speech policies.

    "summary": "After largely focusing Google I/O 2025 on the ways the company wants Gemini to change everything from searching the web to filmmaking, Google is finally ready to launch new hardware. The next Made by Google event is on the books for August 20, and Google has already confirmed what at least one of its new Pixel 10 phones will look like.\nGoogle remains as leak-prone as ever, so nearly all the new hardware the company is expected to announce has all ready been reported on in one form or another. With that in mind and after sifting through what has leaked, here's what Google will show off at the Pixel 10 launch even in New York City on August 20.\nPixel 10, 10 Pro, 10 Pro XL and 10 Pro Fold\nAndroid Headlines / Onleaks \nGoogle's invitation for the event says that the company is sharing \"the latest on our Pixel phones, watches, buds and more,‚Äù which more or less confirms the company will introduce a slate of products that's similar to what it launched in 2024. That means a Pixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro, Pixel 10 Pro XL and Pixel 10 Pro Fold are absolutely on the menu.\nGoogle's tease of the Pixel 10 confirmed what leaked renders have already signaled: the company isn't abandoning the new design language the Pixel 9 established. The pill-shaped camera bump and flat front display will still be present on the Pixel 10, and the real changes will be in the details, like for example, how the flat sides of the Pixel 10 join with the phone's back.\nThose subtle changes will apparently also include the thickness of the Pixel 10s. While both the Pixel 10, 10 Pro, 10 Pro XL and 10 Pro Fold will use the same sized OLED screens as their Pixel 9 counterparts, they'll be housed in thicker and heavier bodies, according to Android Headlines. Google's new Pixels are also supposed to come in new colors. The Pixel 10 will come in \"Frost\" (a royal blue), \"Lemongrass\" (a yellow), \"Indigo\" (a light purple) and \"Obsidian\" (a dark gray), while the Pixel 10 Pro / Pro XL will come in Obsidian, \"Porcelain\" (off-white), \"Moonstone\" (a bluish gray) and \"Jade\" (a light green). Less information is known about the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, though recent leaks suggest it'll come in Moonstone and Jade, as well.\nAndroid Headlines\nThe most visible external change that'll be introduced on the Pixel 10 is the addition of a new telephoto camera. The new telephoto camera is a 11-megapixel 5x telephoto, Android Authority reports, similar to the one on the Pixel 9 Pro Fold. Meanwhile, the Pixel 10 Pro and 10 Pro XL are expected to feature a 50-megapixel wide, 48-megapixel ultrawide, 48-megapixel telephoto and 48-megapixel selfie cameras. The Pixel 10 Pro Fold could feature a different lineup, with a similar main camera, but 12-megapixel ultrawide and telephoto cameras, and 11-megapixel selfie cameras.\nInside the new phones, Google is laying the groundwork for future performance gains with a new Tensor G5 chip. It's likely be much more power-efficient thanks to the company switching to a 3nm design produced by TSMC. Reports suggest the chip might not be all that different in terms of raw power, but the Tensor G5 is likely designed to be extra capable when it comes to using local AI features.\nWhile global tariff turmoil could justify a price increase, Google is reportedly keeping things consistent with the Pixel 10 family. They'll offer similar storage options, come in at the same prices and include the same freebies and incentives. The Pixel 10 will come with six months of Google AI Pro and Fitbit Premium, along with three months of YouTube Premium. Meanwhile the Pixel 10 Pro models will get a year of Google AI Pro, six months of Fitbit Premium and three months of YouTube Premium. The prices and storage options for the phones should breakout down as follows:\n\nPixel 10: 128GB ($799), 256GB ($899)\nPixel 10 Pro: 128GB ($999), 256GB ($1,099), 512GB ($1,219), 1TB ($1,449)\nPixel 10 Pro XL: 256GB ($1,199), 512GB ($1,319), 1TB ($1,549)\nPixel 10 Pro Fold: 256GB ($1,799), 512GB ($1,919), 1TB ($2,149)\n\nPixel Watch 4\n91mobiles / Onleaks\nThe third time was the charm for the Pixel Watch 3, so the main task Google has with the Pixel Watch 4 is to not squander the solid base it already has. Leaks for the company's new smartwatches have been limited so far, but renders of the Pixel Watch 4 shared by 91mobiles do suggest Google has a few changes planned.\nNamely, much like the company's phones, the new Pixel Watch seems like it'll be a little bit thicker and come with smaller bezels. The Pixel Watch 4 should be available to purchase in the same 41mm and 45mm sizes as before, but in new colors ‚Äî including a Moonstone option to match the Pixel 10 ‚Äî and with a brighter display.\nThe thicker frame will also help the smartwatch fit a larger battery and a new wireless charging system, according to Android Headlines. Rather than charge through a puck with pogo pins like the Pixel Watch 3, the Pixel Watch 4 will use a wireless charging stand that could fill it up even faster.\nBeyond that, Google has already indicated how Wear OS is evolving. The new Wear OS 6 update is debuting on the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8, and will presumably be available on the Pixel Watch 4 at launch. It includes built-in access to Gemini, among other tweaks. Given Google also manages the Fitbit Premium subscription, it wouldn't be all that surprising if the Pixel Watch 4 gets some exclusive fitness tracking features, too.\nPixel Buds 2a\nBilly Steele for Engadget\nGoogle launched the Pixel Buds Pro 2 last year, and it typically doesn't update its premium earbuds on a yearly cadence. So instead, Tom's Guide reports Google might pair the Pixel 10 with the Pixel Buds Pro 2 in a new color, and save its new hardware announcements for a sequel to the Pixel Buds A-series called the Pixel Buds 2a.\nUnlike the company's premium wireless earbuds, the A-series Pixel Buds have historically skimped on things like active noise cancellation to hit a lower price. There's little reporting on where Google will take the Pixel Buds 2a, but you can expect the new earbuds to come in some of the new colors being introduced on the Pixel 10.\nPixelsnap\nThe Qi2 wireless charging standard is available for all phone makers to use, but it hasn't been widely adopted among Android phone makers. Qi2 uses magnets to offer improved charging speeds, just like Apple's MagSafe, and the Pixel 10 could mark Google's adoption of Qi2 through a new feature called \"Pixelsnap.\"\nA report from Android Authority¬†suggests the Pixel 10 will include the necessary magnets to make Qi2 happen, and will be introduced alongside a lineup of Pixelsnap accessories. New leaked images showing a Pixel 10 charging with a magnetic charging puck that looks a lot like Apple's MagSafe charger adds even more credence to the rumor.\nIf you need even more convincing, the Wireless Power Consortium has announced that its faster Qi2 25W charging is coming to \"major Android phones.\" It would make sense if Google's Pixel 10s were included considering runs Android itself.\nGemini and other exclusive software features\nGemini is Google's current favorite, and the company is pushing the AI assistant everywhere it makes sense. The last few Pixel Drops ‚Äî Google's regular Pixel-focused software updates ‚Äî have primarily included Gemini features. It would make sense for Google to include a few more software exclusives on the Pixel 10.\nGoogle is hosting the Pixel 10 launch event on August 20 at 1PM ET / 10AM ET. The company has invited press to attend in person, and you can read coverage of everything Google announces right here on Engadget.\nUpdate, July 30, 2:30PM ET: Added information on pricing for the Pixel 10 lineup and new details on Qi2 support.\nUpdate, July 24, 3:44PM ET: Added details on the Pixel Watch 4's display, new colors and charging stand.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/google-pixel-10-launch-what-we-expect-to-see-at-the-made-by-google-event-on-august-20-214510537.html?src=rss",
    "full_text": "With that in mind and after sifting through what has leaked, here's what Google will show off at the Pixel 10 launch even in New York City on August 20. Reports suggest the chip might not be all that different in terms of raw power, but the Tensor G5 is likely designed to be extra capable when it comes to using local AI features. While global tariff turmoil could justify a price increase, Google is reportedly keeping things consistent with the Pixel 10 family.

    "summary": "Of all the new iOS 26 features that Apple previewed at WWDC in June, AirPods updates were only briefly mentioned. Studio-quality audio recording and improved call clarity got top billing, while the addition of a camera remote control was also quickly discussed. However, when the beta software arrived last week, it turned out there were actually more features than described at the event, making this a meatier update for Apple‚Äôs recent AirPods than initially indicated. I‚Äôve spent some time testing all of the new tools, so here‚Äôs what you can expect when you decide to use them.\nHow to get the latest AirPods features\nAll of these updates are available for AirPods that have the H2 chip. Those include AirPods 4, AirPods 4 with ANC and AirPods Pro 2. You‚Äôll have to download the public betas of both iOS 26 and the latest AirPods firmware to use these features. If you‚Äôre not feeling adventurous, all of these items will arrive this fall when the final versions of Apple‚Äôs OS updates roll out. That‚Äôs likely to happen for iOS and AirPods in early September, around the time the new crop of iPhones debuts.\nStudio-quality audio recording\nApple may have framed the voice quality improvements on its AirPods as a boost for creators, but I‚Äôd argue the upgrade will be a welcome change for all. Sure, people who create content will benefit considerably from what Apple calls ‚Äústudio-quality audio recording,‚Äù but the improved performance in noisy environments is something anyone will appreciate.\nThe company hasn‚Äôt offered much detail on exactly what it did to produce higher-quality audio, only describing the change in an initial press release as the result of a mix of the AirPods‚Äô H2 chip, beamforming microphones and computational audio. That last update is likely doing the heavy lifting here, assisted by Apple‚Äôs audio chip, of course. I asked Apple for more specifics, but have yet to hear back.\nImproved audio recording is available across iPhones, iPads and Macs, working in apps like Camera, Voice Memos, Messages (for dictation), Webex and more. Apple also says there‚Äôs upgraded vocal sound quality for calls, offering ‚Äúmore natural vocal texture and clarity‚Äù for Phone, FaceTime and other CallKit-enabled apps. As the voice upgrades are the most notable new features, I was eager to test them, and have spent the last several weeks doing just that (via the developer beta).\nBilly Steele for Engadget\nIf you‚Äôre recording in a quiet room, you‚Äôll notice that enhanced texture and clarity Apple promised. In my samples captured in Voice Memos, there‚Äôs not a huge difference between new and old firmware, but there is a noticeable one. The bigger improvement came when I moved to a noisy spot. Here, Apple dialed back its noise suppression in favor of voice clarity. While you‚Äôll hear the slight roar of background noise in my audio clip, I actually sound better overall. That‚Äôs a trade I‚Äôll bet many users will gladly make over the highly processed, digital-sounding results AirPods used to give us in less-than-ideal surroundings.\nI also noticed that both of my samples with the new software were captured with a 48kHz sample rate. This isn‚Äôt new for AirPods audio recording/quality per se, but before this update some of my clips were still 24kHz ‚Äî like my noisy sample with the old firmware. It seems like Apple is now defaulting to 48kHz as part of the overall sound boost, but that‚Äôs currently unclear and is something else I‚Äôve asked the company for more info about.\nCamera remote\nThe less exciting, but equally handy update for AirPods that Apple announced at WWDC is the addition of a camera remote control. Since newer AirPods have either force sensors or touch controls on their stems, the company saw fit to let you use those to take a photo or start and stop video recording. All of these tasks are done with either one press or a press and hold (you select which one you prefer when you enable the camera remote function).\nFor photos, you get a three-second countdown before your device snaps the picture. This gives you ample time to put your hand down after pressing the AirPods stem so you don‚Äôt ruin the selfie. For video, there‚Äôs no countdown, but there is a second or two delay before the recording starts. So, if you‚Äôre quick about it, you can get your hand away from your ear before showtime. However, you‚Äôll still have to reach for an AirPod or your phone when the time comes to stop recording, so there will be some editing to do there. This all works well, but just remember you have to enable the camera remote feature as it‚Äôs not activated by default after the firmware update.\nSleep pausing and CarPlay switching\nBilly Steele/Engadget\nMost AirPods users have probably fallen asleep with one or both of the earbuds in their ears. Apple‚Äôs update will add automatic pausing when you‚Äôve dozed off to help you not miss much of your TV show or podcast you were watching or listening to. However, it‚Äôs unclear how this works. All we know is it‚Äôs a simple on-or-off switch, and it‚Äôs disabled by default. Some have speculated that it uses sleep data from the Apple Watch, but that hasn‚Äôt been confirmed. Since AirPods have accelerometers, it‚Äôs possible the feature may rely on detecting movement, but I‚Äôve asked for a firm answer on what‚Äôs going on here.\nAnother item on the list of AirPods updates is automatic switching for CarPlay. This is supposed to seamlessly transfer the audio to your car‚Äôs infotainment system from the earbuds when your phone connects to your vehicle. Again, there hasn‚Äôt been much discussion of this, and my attempts to trigger it were unsuccessful. That may be due to the fact that it requires wireless CarPlay, but I‚Äôm not seeing specific options for this in my AirPods settings. I‚Äôm waiting for more info from Apple on this feature too, and hopefully I‚Äôll have more details to add to my observations soon.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/ios-26-updates-for-airpods-preview-enhanced-audio-recording-camera-remote-and-more-173036046.html?src=rss",

Now, the Meta CEO has published a lengthy memo that attempts to lay out his big plan for using the company's vast resources to create \"personal superintelligence.\"\nIn the memo, which reads more like a manifesto than a strategic business plan, Zuckerberg explains that he's \"extremely optimistic that superintelligence will help humanity accelerate our pace of progress.\" The technology, according to him, \"has the potential to begin a new era of personal empowerment where people will have greater agency to improve the world in the directions they choose.\"\nZuckerberg, who has previously expressed a desire to build artificial general intelligence, never defines \"superintelligence.\" Nor does the 616-word memo explain how Meta plans to create such a technology, what it might help people accomplish or why anyone should trust the company to build it. Instead, he implies that Meta will be a better steward of this non-specifically powerful AI than \"others in the industry\" who expect \"humanity will live on a dole of its output.\"\nAs profound as the abundance produced by AI may one day be, an even more meaningful impact on our lives will likely come from everyone having a personal superintelligence that helps you achieve your goals, create what you want to see in the world, experience any adventure, be a better friend to those you care about, and grow to become the person you aspire to be.\nMeta's vision is to bring personal superintelligence to everyone. We believe in putting this power in people's hands to direct it towards what they value in their own lives.\nThis is distinct from others in the industry who believe superintelligence should be directed centrally towards automating all valuable work, and then humanity will live on a dole of its output. At Meta, we believe that people pursuing their individual aspirations is how we have always made progress expanding prosperity, science, health, and culture. This will be increasingly important in the future as well.¬†\nLeft unsaid by Zuckerberg, is the fact that the memo comes at a time when he's been rapidly reorganizing Meta's AI teams. Last month, the company invested $14.8 billion into Scale AI, a move that allowed it to bring Scale CEO and founder Alexandr Wang into the company. The 28-year-old founder is now Meta's Chief AI Officer in charge of its superintelligence efforts.\nMeta has also been on a hiring spree for the effort, and has reportedly been offering prominent researchers eight- and nine-figure pay packages to come to Meta. In recent weeks, the company has successfully recruited high-profile talent from Apple and OpenAI, including Shengjia Zhao, who helped created GPT-4. Zhao announced last week that he will take on the role of \"chief scientist of Meta superintelligence labs.\" Just yesterday, Wired reported that Meta has recently turned its recruiting efforts to Thinking Machines Lab, an AI startup founded by former OpenAI CTO Mira Murati, and that in at least one case it made an offer worth more than $1 billion over several years. (Meta PR said some details of that report were \"off.\") All that is on top of the $72 billion Zuckerberg has said Meta plans to spend on AI infrastructure.\nDriving all this is that Zuckerberg has reportedly grown increasingly frustrated by Meta's own generative AI efforts. The company has had to delay its larger \"Behemoth\" Llama 4 model by months. Llama's struggles have also reportedly caused Zuckerberg to question whether Meta's AI efforts should remain open source, according to CNBC.\nIt's also likely no coincidence Zuckerberg's rambling manifesto comes hours before the company is scheduled to report earnings and tell analysts more about its plans to spend billions of dollars on new AI efforts.\nMeta's CEO also clearly sees AI dominance as an opportunity to end the company's reliance on mobile platforms, especially Apple, which he believes have been able to exert too much control via their app stores. In his memo, he explains that \"personal devices like glasses ‚Ä¶ will become our primary computing devices.\" A future where smart glasses are more important than smartphones would, of course, be extremely convenient for Meta, which has spent the last several years building smart glasses.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/mark-zuckerberg-shares-a-confusing-vision-for-ai-superintelligence-153944322.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "\nThe next season of Apex Legends¬†kicks off on August 5, and it will see the arrival of a new, permanent game mode. Respawn says it built Wildcard as a faster-paced alternative to the core battle royale mode. For instance, when you take out an enemy, they won't leave behind a death box. Instead, their loot will scatter around them, making it easier for you to spot and pick up an item you need or want.\nAnother big difference here is legend stacking. You and your teammates will all be able to play as the same character, if you like. Respawn has retooled the Kings Canyon map for Wildcard, adding ziplines, gravity cannons and other fun stuff to the playground. Second chances will give you another opportunity to pick up the win if things don't pan out for you at first.\nIt's highly likely that Wildcard has been in the works for quite a while, but it's a bit unfortunate for Respawn that it's debuting the mode several weeks after Epic Games added a new, faster-paced battle royale option of its own to Fortnite. Rounds of Blitz Royale ‚Äî which Epic designed primarily for mobile devices ‚Äî can last just a few minutes each. Still, it's probably been a couple of years since I last played Apex, and Wildcard has me intrigued enough to dive back in.\nThere are plenty of other updates coming to Apex when the Showdown season starts, of course. Caustic will have a new ability called Field Research, while his gas canisters and grenades will deal more damage. Meanwhile, Bangalore's smoke canister will be able to breach doors and gain an EMP upgrade. In addition, Respawn is retooling the mid-to-late game with powerful passive abilities called Amps. These will allow you to unlock boosts like infinite ammo, extra armor and healing upgrades.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/a-new-faster-paced-game-mode-is-coming-to-apex-legends-on-august-5-150048274.html?src=rss",
