This bid comes after the Department of Justice proposed in March that Google be forced to sell Chrome after a judge ruled the tech giant acted illegally to maintain a monopoly in online search.

When Google rolled out its new AI-powered ‘Ask Photos’ search tool, I gave it a go — but after finding it slower, less helpful, and more confusing than the classic search, I always wound up pressing Google’s handy button labeled “Switch to classic search” or “Use classic search” instead. (Some people found you could get there quicker by double-tapping the magnifying glass.) But a couple months ago, Google removed all those easily accessible options, and the double-tap now directs to Gemini instead of Google’s old system. I couldn’t figure out how to turn it off at first… but thankfully, the option for classic search is still there, buried in a settings menu. I will say that Ask Photos is better than it was originally; it seems Google had a bit of a wake-up call. If your Google Photos library also includes your spouse’s photos, like me, and they have a different phone, you can find your own photos by searching for the exact name of your phone’s camera."

I’m grateful to all of you for making this place what it is today. There’s so much work to do from our side, more to come.” The new milestone means that Threads was able to add 50 million monthly users in the past quarter, as Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced in the last week of April that the platform had reached more than 350 million monthly active users. Recent data from market intelligence provider Similarweb showed that Threads is nearing X’s daily app users on mobile devices. In June 2025, Threads’ mobile app for iOS and Android saw 115.1 million daily active users, marking a 127.8% increase compared to the previous year. On the other hand, X reached 132 million daily active users, reflecting a 15.2% year-over-year decline. However, Similarweb found that X’s worldwide daily web visits are well ahead of Threads, as the Elon Musk-owned social network saw 145.8 million average daily web visits worldwide in June, while Threads had just 6.9 million."

    "full_text": "Ever since the launch of ChatGPT, AI companies have been racing to gain a foothold in government in more ways than one. Most recently, that’s meant luring government users with attractive low prices for their products. Within the last week, both OpenAI and Anthropic have introduced special prices for government versions of their generative AI chatbots, ChatGPT and Claude, and xAI announced its Grok for Government in mid-July. OpenAI and Anthropic are both offering their chatbots to federal agencies for one year for a nominal price of $1. Anthropic appeared to try to one-up OpenAI’s announcement by saying all three branches of government could access a special price for Claude, while ChatGPT will be available to the executive branch for the low intro price. Securing government customers can be a great way for tech businesses to secure large userbases and income. The US government says it spends more than $100 billion a year on “IT and cyber-related investments, including the purchase of software licenses.” That $1 price follows a tried-and-true enterprise software playbook used by companies like Slack: get as many users as you can in hopes that a service becomes so valuable that employers have to keep paying for it, eventually at a much higher cost. As they jockey for power in other parts of the government, giving their product away nearly for free (at first) could help give OpenAI or Anthropic an edge. As the government struggles over how and whether to regulate AI, there could also be a soft power benefit to getting its workers familiar with and reliant on these services — and perhaps, by extension, more reluctant to kneecap them. OpenAI, in its announcement, claimed its offering “delivers on a core pillar of the Trump Administration’s AI Action Plan by making powerful AI tools available across the federal government so that workers can spend less time on red tape and paperwork, and more time doing what they came to public service to do: serve the American people.”"

The Blink doesn’t have smart alerts or quick replies, and it only records 1080p video at a standard 16:9 aspect ratio). The company has developed a super energy-efficient chip that will power its cameras longer than any other doorbell I’ve tested. When wired, it will activate an existing chime (something neither the sub-$100 Ring nor Wyze doorbells can do) and provide constant power — not just trickle charge. Ring recently added 24/7 recording to some wired cameras, and that feature will be included in the $20-a-month plan. Eufy’s FamiLock S3 Max is a two-in-one video doorbell and smart lock that manages to handle both functions pretty well. Using palm recognition doesn’t require you to physically touch the door lock and can be more reliable than a fingerprint reader for older folks whose fingerprints have degraded over time. Some — such as Ring — offer the more secure option of end-to-end encryption, where there is no processing as the company has no access to your footage at all.The simplest and cheapest solution is to just use a video doorbell for a live view and not record any footage or audio."

    "full_text": "The original UP Phone was described by the company as “the ultimate privacy-focused smartphone” and by privacy platform GrapheneOS as “a clear cut scam.” (It was first announced in June 2022, though it didn’t reach customers until 2024; Unplugged wouldn’t tell me how many units were sold, only that it sold out within three hours.) The phone runs on UnpluggedOS, an Android fork that doesn’t include Google Mobile Services. John McAfee announced his own “hack-proof” phone in 2017, the likes of the Freedom Phone have capitalized on American patriotism to sell “free speech” phones, and /e/OS and GrapheneOS are open-source alternatives that emphasize efforts to keep your data out of the hands of tech giants like Google. He still voiced caution though, warning that any independent phone company comes with risks. That was a sentiment echoed by Nicholas Weaver, a networking researcher at the International Computer Science Institute, who suggested those worried about privacy are generally better off sticking to the major players. Hebeisen acknowledges that the kill switch is “not relevant for most users” but could be useful for “highly exposed users whose potential adversaries include nation states.” He also suggests the built-in firewall offers “definite privacy and some security benefits,” while the centralized privacy settings could encourage users to be more privacy conscious. It will almost certainly begin falling much further behind and won’t receive proper long term support.” He once even claimed that the phone could have prevented Hamas’s attack on October 7th, 2023. Prince has been the face of Unplugged since it launched, and how much you trust the company to preserve your privacy might come down to how much you trust Prince and his politics. “Security products depend on both engineering and the folks behind them,” Weaver argues."

Federal prosecutors in New York charged Kwon after his firm’s Terra stablecoin and sister token Luna, crashed in 2022, causing some investors to lose all of their savings on a cryptocurrency they thought was supposed to be less volatile than others. Kwon was arrested in Montenegro in 2023 before the country extradited him to the US over a year later. Inner City Press, which reports on courtroom proceedings, said Kwon admitted to knowingly defrauding cryptocurrency customers and working with another company to artificially inflate Terra’s $1 peg. Kwon’s sentencing is set for December 11th, with the conspiracy charge holding a maximum sentence of five years, and wire fraud at a maximum of 20 years, according to Bloomberg."

(Even if you’re too young to remember VHS tapes, seeing old videos in this format pulls on the heartstrings. In practice, there were some challenges that the app still needs to overcome. To support its development, Cassette offers an optional premium subscription (dubbed “ColorPlus”) that allows users to manually select a VHS tape instead of having the app play a video at random. There’s also an affordable Lifetime unlock for $7.99, which can go a long way toward supporting indie projects like this."

This is not a new issue, but as the SRM duopoly held by Northrop Grumman and L3Harris’ Aerojet Rocketdyne is increasingly challenged by Anduril and others, it highlights a vulnerability in the supply chain. The Pentagon backed a “merger-to-monopoly” in the 1990s, preferring to have one healthy provider rather than two struggling companies that couldn’t be competitive without government subsidies, he said. “It’s just enough orders and lead time to create the fuel.” AMPAC did not respond to TechCrunch’s request for comment on the status of that new line. Funding for SRM manufacturing is part of a larger push to fund the industrial base."

You can access more channels by adding one of Sling’s category-specific packages, like Sports Extra, News Extra or Entertainment Extra. Sling Extras cost $1 per package for a Day Pass, $2 for a Weekend Pass and $3 for a Week Pass.\nHow much value you get from Sling’s offering will depend on your viewing habits.

The basic Alert features are still free, but Alert Live is now available for $2.99 per month or $24.99 per year. Pebblebee is also introducing a Silent Mode upgrade for both Alert and Alert Live today, for free, that sends alerts more discreetly without the siren or flashing light, which the company says is designed for “high-stress or unsafe situations where quiet communication is essential.” Correction, August 12th: An earlier version of this article misstated the name of the new subscription service.

Its 512GB of storage is sufficient for keeping some larger files on your computer instead of keeping them in the cloud, or constantly transferring them to and from a portable SSD. Speaking of charging, the 14-inch MacBook Pro with M4’s battery lasted a little over 12 hours of moderate to heavy usage when we reviewed it. The apps you use and your preferred screen brightness level will heavily impact the laptops’s battery life, but you should be able to get through the school or work day without having to plug it in. In our tests the earbuds were comfortable to wear (even with glasses), stayed in place during runs, lasted around 10 hours per charge and sounded pretty good. Each bud has an optical heart rate sensor, and both iOS and Android users can log information from their workouts when using a compatible app. The battery-powered lamp weighs 2.3 pounds, and can last up to 60 hours per charge depending on your brightness settings.

    "summary": "It feels like Summer Game Fest is only just in our rear view mirror and yet there's another video game extravaganza on the horizon. Gamescom is the planet's largest gaming event and we're sure to find out about a bunch of interesting new games at the Opening Night Live showcase. Xbox is broadcasting from the show floor across two days, and there will be other presentations that are worth keeping an eye on.\nGamescom is taking place between August 20 and 24 this year, and we're learning bits and pieces about what to expect from the various showcases. The affair will kick off with Opening Night Live, a showcase hosted by Geoff Keighley that bridges the gap between his two other major events, Summer Game Fest Live and The Game Awards. That will be followed by two days of Xbox broadcasts, the latest edition of the Future Games Show and three days of Bethesda streams.\nWe'll update this preview with more details as we get them, and embed video versions of each stream as they become available too. Here's our breakdown of how to watch Gamescom 2025 and what to expect from the event.\nGamescom schedule\n\nOpening Night Live — August 19, 1:30PM ET (pre-show), 2PM (main show)\nXbox @ gamescom 2025 Broadcast — August 20, 9AM ET\nFuture Games Show — August 20, 2PM ET\nXbox @ gamescom 2025 Broadcast — August 21, 9AM ET\nBethesda — August 22-25\n\nHow to watch Gamescom Opening Night Live - August 19, 2PM ET\nWatch on YouTube\nOpening Night Live perhaps won't feature as many heavy hitters as Summer Game Fest Live or The Game Awards typically have, but one thing's for certain: Call of Duty fans will definitely want to tune in. The two-hour showcase will feature the \"worldwide reveal\" of Call of Duty: Black Ops 7. We'll almost certainly get a release date here too.\nGiven that Microsoft has said Hollow Knight: Silksong will be playable on PC and ROG Xbox Ally X at its Gamescom booth, and the game is still slated to arrive this year, this event seems as good a time as any for us to finally get a release date for that thing — over six years after we first got to try it out. There will certainly be more eyeballs on ONL than Microsoft's own streams, so that seems like the likeliest bet for any concrete Silksong news at Gamescom.\nYou can also expect a trailer for multiplayer RPG Honor of Kings: World, along with new looks at Resident Evil Requiem, Silent Hill f, Daemon X Machina: Titanic Scion and The Seven Deadly Sins: Origin. You'll get to see the opening cinematic for World of Warcraft's Midnight expansion as well. It won't all be game reveals and announcements, though — there'll be a performance of music from Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 featuring composer Lorien Testard and vocalist Alice Duport-Percier.\nWe'll be keeping tabs on all the news from Opening Night Live right here on Engadget. Myself, senior editor Jess Conditt and editor-in-chief Aaron Souppouris will be live-blogging our way through ONL. Join us! It should be fun.\nHow to watch Xbox @ gamescom 2025 Broadcast — August 20, 9AM ET\nWatch on YouTube, Twitch, TikTok or Facebook\nOne major piece of news we're likely to get from Xbox during one of its streams (if it isn't revealed at ONL beforehand) is the release date and pricing for the ASUS ROG Xbox Ally and Xbox Ally X handheld systems. Leaker billbil-kun has reported the devices will arrive on October 16, at least in Europe, costing €599 for the Xbox Ally and €899 for the higher-end Xbox Ally X.\nMicrosoft had already confirmed these handhelds would be available in time for the holiday season, so that rumored release date makes sense. Either way, we should get confirmation during Gamescom of when to expect these devices, especially since the company says it will discuss the handhelds during its August 20 stream. This particular event will also feature the likes of Grounded 2, Keeper and Call of Duty: Black Ops 7.\nAlong with the English-language broadcast, Xbox's streams will be available in other languages on regional Xbox channels on the likes of YouTube, Twitch, TikTok and Facebook. The streams will be available in Traditional Chinese, German, French, Japanese, Brazilian Portuguese and Mexican Spanish, as well as with ASL and English audio descriptions.\nHow to watch Future Games Show — August 20, 2PM ET\nWatch on Twitch or YouTube\n\nActors David Hayter (Snake in the Metal Gear series) and Maggie Robertson (Lady Dimitrescu in Resident Evil Village) will be hosting this edition of the Future Games Show. This installment will feature more than 50 games across world premieres, new trailers and sudden demo releases. \nCapcom, Bandai Namco Entertainment, EA and NACON are among those who'll be represented in this one, which will feature projects from AAA and indie publishers and studios. A post-show will run for 40 minutes and feature more trailers, world premieres and demo announcements.\nHow to watch Xbox @ gamescom 2025 Broadcast — August 21, 9AM ET\nWatch on YouTube, Twitch, TikTok or Facebook\nXbox will be broadcasting live from the Gamescom show floor for a second straight day. This particular stream will include details on Ninja Gaiden 4, The Outer Worlds 2, Overwatch 2 (perhaps with a look at Season 18, which is set to start on August 26) and other games. Microsoft plans to reveal more details about its schedule in the days leading up to Gamescom.\nHow to watch Bethesda broadcasts - August 22\nWatch on Twitch\nThere will be plenty from the Bethesda side of the Xbox division as well. The publisher will be broadcasting from the Xbox show floor at Gamescom for three days, starting on August 22. According to Microsoft, these streams will include \"developer interviews, game showcases, community segments, crafting highlights and live IRL tours.\"This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/how-to-watch-gamescom-2025-and-what-to-expect-120024733.html?src=rss",

You'll get to see the opening cinematic for World of Warcraft's Midnight expansion as well. Myself, senior editor Jess Conditt and editor-in-chief Aaron Souppouris will be live-blogging our way through ONL. Microsoft had already confirmed these handhelds would be available in time for the holiday season, so that rumored release date makes sense. This installment will feature more than 50 games across world premieres, new trailers and sudden demo releases. How to watch Xbox @ gamescom 2025 Broadcast — August 21, 9AM ET Xbox will be broadcasting live from the Gamescom show floor for a second straight day."

While Judge Jonathan Beach found that the two tech giants had abused their dominant position in the market for app distribution to limit competition, he rejected Epic’s claims that the companies had engaged in “unconscionable conduct.” Epic Games has been fighting Apple and Google’s fee structure for in-app purchases in various jurisdictions around the planet. The company scored a major win against Apple this year in the U.S., and as a result, Fortnite returned to Apple’s U.S. App Store after five years. Tuesday’s ruling could yield a similar result for Epic in Australia: The company’s CEO Tim Sweeny said that the Epic Games Store and Fortnite would return to the Apple App Store in the country soon. “We welcome the court’s rejection of Epic’s demands that we distribute app stores from within the Google Play store, and Epic’s attacks on other critical security protections that users rely on. However, we disagree with the court’s characterisation of our billing policies and practices, as well as its findings regarding some of our historical partnerships,” a Google spokesperson said in an emailed statement. Meanwhile, Apple told ABC News that its app store is the safest way for users to get apps, and that it disagreed with the court’s ruling on some of Epic’s claims.

Oura is targeting the perimenopausal crowd with its newest standout feature, which will be available through Cycle Insights found in the Oura app. Over the past few years, there's been an increased interest in perimenopause and menopausal stages, a topic often under-addressed in the wellness space. The new Cycle Insights feature provides a 12-question assessment that quantifies symptoms to give you an \"impact to quality of life\" score. With all this data, Oura provides a PDF report that can be shared with your doctor so they can view insights on symptoms and other data. I previously tested the Oura ring, and it's one of my favorite smart rings on the market because it's constantly striving to improve its software and takes into consideration the types of people attracted to its technology. These improved features make it more inclusive toward parents-to-be and individuals going through menopause. I could see other smart wellness wearables following suit, since this is a growing demographic. Having this type of information will make it easier for those in these life stages to better understand how these changes are affecting their bodies, and the data can be easily shared with medical providers."

    "full_text": "Make no bones about it: Skelly's going high tech. Home Depot's popular 12-foot-tall skeleton decoration is coming back to life this Halloween with an app that lets you give the new Ultra Skelly a voice and new moves to scare the trick-or-treaters. The new animatronic version is shorter than the original, at 6.5 feet tall, but you can freak out your whole neighborhood with this skeleton's rotating upper torso, moving mouth and 18 LCD eye variations (ew). Skelly can now chat with visitors through five preset recordings and up to 30 seconds of custom recording, plus Bluetooth capabilities that let you interact in real time. And you can modulate your voice to make everything sound extra spooky. Skelly was originally launched in 2020, when the pandemic forced people to celebrate Halloween at a distance. Perhaps because of its giant stature -- it's easy to spot, even when social distancing -- the skeleton became a hit and has been resurrected every year since with upgrades and friends. This year those friends include dragons, trolls, scarecrows and a Skelly Cat (not to be confused with Smelly Cat). You can order Skelly and co now on the Home Depot website or app for $279."

    "summary": "The back to school season is a good time to save on tech, whether you're returning to campus or not. While some discounts are reserved for students, others are available to everyone. One of the best right now is on Apple's M3-powered iPad Air, which is somewhat of a goldilocks tablet — one that will be a great option for just about everyone. You can grab it for $150 off at Amazon right now.\nThis deal applies to each configuration of the 11-inch and 13-inch versions of the most recent iPad Air. So, the 11-inch model is as low as $449, while the 13-inch model is down to $649. The same deals can be found at Best Buy and Target if you prefer to shop somewhere other than Amazon. This is an all-time low price and beats the deal we saw on Prime Day by $30. \n \nThe iPad Air M3 is more of an iterative refresh than a grand overhaul, but the spec bump means it’ll last you a long time before the tablet’s performance becomes a problem. This iPad occupies the position of \"best for most\" in our iPad buying guide, reinforcing that goldilocks analogy. The M3 chip is the main draw here, with Geekbench 6 scores proclaiming it around 16 percent more powerful than the M2 iPad Air, which is no slouch itself.\nBeyond the chip, it has a superior display and speakers to the entry-level model, and wider accessory support. You also get the option of a 13-inch display, which is great for artists or anyone who sees the iPad as a viable laptop replacement.\nIf there’s an obvious downside to the iPad Air M3, it’s that it doesn't have the nice 120Hz OLED display of the iPad Pro. This is hardly surprising, as Apple often focuses on display tech to differentiate its Pro and non-Pro devices, but it’s probably time the refresh rate on the middle-of-the-road iPad at least jumped up to ProMotion. Face ID is long overdue too. If you can live with these caveats, though, the iPad Air is an excellent option, particularly at this price.\nCheck out our coverage of the best Apple deals for more discounts, and follow @EngadgetDeals on X for the latest tech deals and buying advice.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/apples-ipad-air-m3-drops-to-a-new-record-low-price-162908915.html?src=rss",

With run times ranging from 1 hour and 32 minutes for Jurassic Park III to a whopping 2 hours and 27 minutes for Jurassic World: Dominion, binge-watching the franchise is a 12-hour-and-27-minute-long commitment. Or 14 minutes longer if you watch the 2-hour, 41-minute extended edition of Jurassic World: Dominion. If you watch Jurassic World: Dominion's extended edition rather than the theatrical cut, that balloons to 12 hours and 41 minutes. Here's how to watch the entire Jurassic Park movie and TV show universe in chronological order by release date: You may be able to skip Jurassic Park III if a nearly 13-hour marathon is biting off more than you can chew -- the film even takes place on a different island from the original, Isla Sorna. Peacock Premium Plus -- which removes ads (with limited exceptions), lets you download some titles for offline viewing, and provides local NBC affiliate channel streaming -- is $14 per month or $140 per year. Instacart Plus subscribers get Peacock Premium bundled with their subscription at no extra cost. Jurassic World: Rebirth is still in theaters, but I expect the film to be available on Peacock eventually. Based on previous release schedules, I'm guessing Rebirth will be available on Peacock three to four months after its theatrical debut, meaning you'll probably be able to watch the movie at home via NBC's streaming service in October or November."

And that's fine, but what about those of us who buy the Pro models in order to take deeper advantage of features like exposure compensation, Photographic Styles and ProRaw formats? Many photographers -- myself very much included -- want to use these tools as standard, using our powerful iPhones in much the same way we would a mirrorless camera from Canon or Sony. I'm keen to see Apple at least match Xiaomi's phone here with a similar 1-inch type sensor. Apple's dalliances in AI so far haven't exactly been groundbreaking and I worry that the company may want to be seen as making a bigger push for deeper, more 'innovative' uses for AI. Its widest aperture is f/1.6 -- significantly wider than the f/1.78 of the iPhone 16 Pro.That wider aperture lets in a lot of light in dim conditions and more authentically achieves out-of-focus bokeh around a subject. But using Apple's styles means you can take your images with the look already applied, and then change it afterward if you don't like it -- nothing is hard-baked into your image. I was recently impressed with Samsung's new tool for creating custom color filters based off the look of other images. The DNG file typically also offers more latitude to brighten dark areas or tone down highlights in an image, making it extremely versatile. If Apple were able to implement all these changes -- excluding, perhaps, the full-frame sensor which even I can admit is a touch ambitious -- it would have an absolute beast of a camera on its hands."

    "full_text": "While Apple has yet to confirm anything (as usual), the Ultra 3's absence at last year's launch and its two-year upgrade cadence make 2025 a prime candidate for its debut. Ideally, this would come with slimmer bezels to accommodate the larger, sharper display -- keeping with Apple's tradition of maximizing screen real estate without adding bulk to the already giant Ultra. The bump up in processing power could support new features such as enhanced GPS tracking, satellite connectivity, more advanced health monitoring and potentially some additional Apple Intelligence integrations like Workout Buddy which Apple announced in WatchOS 26 (and which I've started to think might be a bigger deal that it first appeared). One of the more intriguing Ultra 3 rumors comes from Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, who has reported that Apple is exploring satellite connectivity for the next Apple Watch Ultra model. This would enable emergency messaging and location sharing even in areas without cellular coverage. If implemented, it could build on the Apple Watch's existing lineup of potentially life-saving features like emergency SOS, fall detection and car crash detection to outdoor enthusiasts going off the grid or even people who live in remote areas. Gurman's report also suggests the Ultra may gain 5G connectivity, a step up from its current LTE-only support. This would build on Apple's recently announced AI powered Workout Buddy which delivers personalized motivation for certain workouts with Watch OS 26. The Ultra's durability and long battery life could make it an ideal platform for round-the-clock training guidance, though based on current rumors, the rollout may be better aligned with a 2026 release. If the pattern holds, preorders should begin a few days after the keynote and arrive in stores (or at your doorstep) one to two weeks after that."

United on Tuesday announced Apple TV Plus is now included at no cost on the airline's more than 130,000 seatback screens and in the United app. Passengers will also get access to The Morning Show and Bad Sisters in September. An Apple TV Plus subscription typically costs $10 per month. The United and Apple TV Plus collab follows Monday's news of Crunchyroll partnering with Delta Air Lines. American Airlines also offers Apple TV Plus episodes as an in-flight perk. The original series will appear on a featured Apple TV Plus channel, and passengers can expect new additions each month. The airline noted \"more than 250 TV show episodes, feature documentaries and films\" will eventually be available to fliers. It's unclear if season 2 of Severance will ultimately join the lineup.

    "summary": "There's arguably no piece of tech more important for a college student than a good laptop. Whether you’re working on an essay, doing research for a paper or just need some downtime streaming your favorite show, a solid laptop for college is an investment that can (and should) last you for years. While the best laptops come in all shapes and sizes and range in price, college students don’t need a power-hungry machine or a notebook with the latest graphics card to get things done. For most, the best laptop for college is ideally thin and lightweight, and provides enough battery to last all day without having to be tethered to the wall. No matter what you’re studying, we’ve researched and tested a range of laptops for you to consider as you decide which is the best laptop for college for you.\nWhat to consider in your next laptop for college\nIt’s important to consider your major and what you need your laptop to do before deciding on the best laptop for college. For example, if you’re a liberal arts major and will mostly be writing or making presentations, you don’t need an expensive system with a discrete graphics card. Alternatively, if you’re a film major who might need to render videos on a regular basis, having a beefy PC can significantly reduce the time it takes to finish a project. You’ll also want to take a look at any guidelines provided by your college or your specific program, as you may need required software or apps that only run on a specific OS. \nSome other things to consider are if you want a more portable 13 or 14-inch machine that’s easier to carry around, or if you prefer something with a larger screen. On top of that, if you are doing tasks like photo or video editing, you’ll probably want to go for a system with a high-resolution display (1440p or 4K), so it's easier to see details. As for other specs, ideally you’ll want 16GB of RAM (though you can go down to 8GB on a Chromebook) and at least 512GB or 1TB of storage. Most newer laptops now come with SSD storage, too, which means you can store and transfer data much faster.\nFinally, while your budget ultimately will determine how powerful of a laptop you can get, well-equipped ultraportables will generally cost between $1,000 and $1,400, with prices going up from there for systems with discrete GPUs. Budget Windows laptops and Chromebooks can be affordable alternatives though, with many going for just $500 to $700. But again, remember to check your school’s requirements because it’s not worth saving a few bucks only to find out that your notebook can’t run the app you need for all your homework.\nSee Also:\n\nBest Laptops for 2025\nBest Gaming Laptops\nBest 2-in-1 Laptops for 2025\nBest Chromebooks\nBest Cheap Windows Laptops for 2025\n\nThe best laptops for college students\n \n \n \n \nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/best-laptops-for-students-130054631.html?src=rss",

Both MacBook Air models lasted for well over 18 hours in our tests, so they’ll likely last you two work days without needing to be juiced up. And while they’re far from gaming PCs, we were still impressed to see them run the graphically intensive game Lies of P at 60fps in 1080p. So if you're looking for a portable and well-rounded Windows PC, it's hard to go wrong with the Dell 14 Premium. All of this comes in an unibody aluminum chassis that weighs just 3.3 pounds, which is the same as a 15-inch MacBook Air. Put simply, the ROG G14 is one of the best laptops in its class, which makes it a great choice for students that are dabbling in a bunch of different subjects or disciplines. Also, if you like the G14’s mix of performance and design but want something a touch larger, there’s the ROG Zephyrus G16 which supports up to an RTX 5090 GPU."

    "full_text": "Some of her reasons for recommending it include its trusted brand name and its 5% hydrogen peroxide whitening agent. Unlike other whitening agents that work by removing stains on the surface of the tooth, hydrogen peroxide can get inside the tooth so it whitens intrinsically as well as extrinsically. Sachar also recommends this toothpaste, saying, \"Colgate Optic White Pro Series is the strongest professional-level whitening toothpaste on the market and would be my pick. Its 5% hydrogen peroxide content is the most effective bleaching agent in an OTC toothpaste, delivering visible results fast.\" However, she recommends patients use it with care and alternate it with a non-whitening or enamel-repairing toothpaste periodically. Who should not get it: According to Khan, one downside to this toothpaste is that it contains sodium lauryl sulfate which may cause irritation, such as canker sores. Other popular whitening toothpastes may also contain SLS, so it's important to look at the ingredients before you buy a product if you're sensitive to it. \"It may not be ideal for sensitive teeth or continuous long-term use without alternating with a non-whitening toothpaste,\" adds Sachar. \"I recommend this one for short-term use or occasional whitening boosts. I tell my patients to use it for short periods of time and alternate it with a non-whitening or enamel-repairing toothpaste periodically.\""

    "summary": "A mouse may seem like a small consideration for your workstation setup. But after you’ve addressed the crucial ergonomics — raising your monitor to eye-level, using the right keyboard and taking frequent breaks throughout your workdays — it’s a good idea to make sure the mouse you use is comfortable as well. People dealing with conditions like carpal tunnel and wrist pain may be interested in finding the best ergonomic mouse for them. Vertical and semi-vertical designs turn your palm towards your midline instead of downwards, creating a handshake position that may feel more natural. Others employ a trackball to minimize the work your shoulder has to do in a day. I tested out more than 20 highly regarded ergonomic mice to come up with recommendations for vertical, semi-vertical, trackball and more, along with advice about the merits of the different ergonomic designs.\nTable of contents\n\nWhat to look for in an ergonomic mouse\nHow we test ergonomic mice\nBest ergonomic mouse for 2025\nOther ergonomic mice we tested\n\nBest ergonomic mouse for 2025\n \n \n \n \n \nWhat to look for in an ergonomic mouse\nLike everything related to ergonomics, the mouse design that works best for you will depend on your body and what you need to do on a typical day. So the shapes, added features and how the mouse communicates with your computer will determine which you should get. \nTypes and shapes of ergonomic mice\nWhen we’re talking about ergonomic mice for productivity purposes, it usually refers to mice that look distinctly different from the standard, typically with shapes that tilt your hand towards a more “handshake” position instead of facing your palm downward. A vertical ergonomic mouse has the most severe up-and-down angle, semi-vertical mice split the difference and trackball models stay put on your desk while your thumb controls the movement of the cursor. Gaming mice have an ergonomic category as well, but that simply refers to a mouse with curves designed to fit either the right or left hand. It differentiates those mice from ambidextrous models, which don’t conform to a particular hand.\nEach of three ergonomic mice shapes can help address different concerns. If you’re trying to avoid twisting your forearm, a vertical mouse could be what you need. Clicking a vertical mouse feels more like pinching your finger and thumb together, which could relieve certain other wrist issues as well.\nA semi-vertical mouse feels the most like a traditional computer mouse, with an angle closer to 50 or 60 degrees from your desk. Semi-vertical mouse clicks can feel easier too, since you're pushing down instead of pinching. Some vertical and semi-vertical mice have an optional flange that supports the heel of your palm. Instead of pivoting on those bones to make your cursor move, your palm and wrist stay aligned and the entire arm controls the motion.\nA trackball mouse can also keep your wrist from bending, as it keeps your forearm planted. My personal struggle is with neck and shoulder tension, so trackballs and very lightweight vertical mice work best for me as their configuration lets me keep my forearm from moving. \nDPI, weight and buttons\nAs this guide focuses on productivity mice, gaming-specific stats like polling rates and IPS values don’t really come into play. (My colleague Jeff Dunn does a good job of explaining those metrics in his gaming mouse review guide.) What matters here are numbers like DPI, or dots per inch, which indicates how sensitive a mouse is. The higher the setting, the faster your cursor will move across the screen. Low DPI settings let you do precision work like pixel-by-pixel editing in Photoshop. All the mice here have at least two and as many as five settings, ranging from 400 to 3,200 DPI. Mice that make it easy to switch from high to low DPI might make sense if you do a lot of detailed work.\nWeight makes a difference in vertical and semi-vertical mice (but not trackballs, since they stay put). A lighter model will be easier to move around, which could put less strain on your wrist and arm. That said, a little weight can make your movements feel more precise. For reference, a featherweight gaming mouse might weigh 45 grams and a large vertical mouse with a flange attached might weigh 140 grams. The latter may feel a little heavy, but if it has smooth feet and is used with a decent mouse pad, it will feel lighter.\nIt's always nice to have easily clickable buttons, but that matters even more when body health is a concern. Pressing hard on a button tenses up my arm and shoulder like nobody’s business. Since it’s an action desk workers perform hundreds or thousands of times a day, it's essential that it be effortless — nothing ruled out a mouse quicker in my tests than tough buttons.\n\n\n\n\nExtra features\nAll mice have the basics: a right and left button and a scroll wheel. All mice in this guide also have a DPI selector button. Some have other functions such as a scroll wheel that can click with a press or handle horizontal scrolling by tilting the wheel to the right or left. Many also have back and forward buttons for browser windows, and sometimes those two are programmable to perform different functions in other apps.\nMore complex mice have additional buttons to customize, typically using a mouse’s proprietary software. Depending on that software, you can set buttons to mute calls, copy and paste, undo and redo, switch tabs and more. Performing multiple functions without extraneous movement is a big plus in ergonomic design. Of course, there are a number of keyboards that let you program multiple functions into specific keys, which cuts down on superfluous movement even more, which you can read about in our ergonomic keyboard guide.\nConnectivity and compatibility\nAll the mice here will work with Mac's operating system as well as Microsoft Windows, and some work with Chrome, Linnux and even iPadOS (though I didn’t test those) as well. They connect in three ways: Wired, via Bluetooth or with a 2.4Ghz wireless dongle. More devices have incorporated USB-C interfaces, but most mice still use USB-A. So if you have a laptop that only sports USB-C ports (looking at you, MacBook), you’ll need an adapter to use a wired or dongle-enabled mouse. You can use a hub or docking station for this purpose, but in testing this guide, I ran into connectivity issues using a wireless USB receiver in a docking station, particularly when there wasn’t a direct and completely clear path between the mouse and receiver. Everything worked far more reliably with just a direct USB-C to A adapter.\nThe difference between wireless and Bluetooth is twofold: a wireless dongle connection tends to be quicker to set up. You just plug in the accessory, turn on the mouse (potentially granting permission for the device) and you’re set. For Bluetooth, you need to open the settings menu, activate pairing mode on the mouse, search for the mouse and then click connect. There’s also a bit more latency when using Bluetooth versus a wireless mouse. It’s not something most people will notice doing workaday stuff, but if you plan on playing some Overwatch after hours and want to use the same mouse, you might want to go with the faster, 2.4Ghz route.\nHow we test ergonomic mice\nAfter many hours of research and reading reviews, I gathered just over 20 mice with good claims to ergonomic design to test in my work setup. I mostly tried out mice geared towards a work-from-home or office setting, as opposed to gaming (we have a whole guide dedicated to that topic). I used each mouse for a few hours or a few days, noting how well they felt as well as how they performed. I mostly used a MacBook Pro M1 but verified Windows compatibility with an Asus ROG Strix laptop. For reference, my right hand measures 7.25 inches from the wrist crease to the tip of my middle finger, which is just under average for a man and large for a woman.\nOther ergonomic mice we tried\nRazer Pro Click V2 Vertical\nI was thrilled to see a gaming company announce a vertical mouse. In gaming peripherals, the term \"ergonomic\" just means “not ambidextrous” as in, designed for the right (or left) hand. To be fair, Razer calls this a productivity mouse and a rep told me it was meant for those who work often and occasionally want to game with the same mouse. But still, the Pro Click V2 Vertical mouse is at least gaming adjacent and has an actual ergo design. The handshake position is nice and upright, forcing very little twisting in your forearm. It’s immediately apparent how well built it is, plus it’s lightweight, glides easily and nicely fits in the hand. It has three connectivity options: Bluetooth, wired or USB-A dongle. And, because this is Razer, you also get some sweet, sweet RGB lights at the bottom.\nUnfortunately, I think Razer’s Basilisk V3 is still a better ergonomic mouse for gaming. Even though it doesn’t have the tilted handshake position, I vastly preferred using it to the Pro Click V2 Vertical. The V2 Vertical has a small flange that supports the pinky, but my palm was left to pinch against the desk, so I found myself lifting my arm a lot. While the Hyperspeed dongle is quite responsive, the Bluetooth connection was consistently slow to wake. Using the mouse wired wasn’t great either, as the weight of the cable was more noticeable with a tilted position. The right and left buttons required only a light touch if my hand fully grasped the mouse, but if I backed off the grip a little, the buttons were tough to click.\nFinally, for a gaming mouse, there aren’t a ton of programmable buttons: just right, left, scroll, DPI and a forward/back pair surrounding the thumb slot. There are some great ideas here and, like most things Razer makes, the build is top-notch, so I’m excited to see if the brand’s next effort in the area of ergonomic gaming mouse addresses a few of this model’s drawbacks.\nLogitech MX Master 3S\nLogitech mice have made many appearances in our guides over the years. In our guide to the best productivity mice, we name the Logitech MX Master 3S the best wireless mouse you can get. As I considered its merits as a mouse, it was indeed an impressive option — it connected flawlessly, has a useful sideways wheel as well as the traditional scroll feature and the thumb rest is a nice touch. But the ergonomics didn't quite do it for me as it holds your hand in the standard, palm-down, claw-grip position.\nLogitech Lift Vertical\nThe Logi Lift Vertical is likely one of the more popular ergonomic mice out there. It’s fairly lightweight, has an attractive design with a nice feel to the exterior. The buttons are easy to click and nearly silent. It also connects quickly using either Bluetooth or a dongle. Unfortunately, it doesn’t glide across the mouse pad all that smoothly, and the pinch grip the design requires actually aggregated my wrist. The cursor movements are fairly precise, though I occasionally had trouble getting the cursor to land just where I wanted it. Also, it’s small; my hands are too large for the Lift. Logitech’s Logitech MX Vertical is essentially a larger version, but again, the skinnier shape was uncomfortable in my hands and it was tough to get the cursor to go where I wanted it to.\nHP 920 ergonomic vertical\nThe HP 920 ergonomic vertical also has a flange for resting your palm, but it makes the mouse overly heavy to move around. Without it, however, it's an extremely comfortable mouse with a premium feel, rechargeable battery, and two programmable thumb buttons. Unfortunately, the cursor movement was frustratingly imprecise and didn’t go exactly where I pointed, forcing a number of corrections — and extraneous movement is what we’re trying to avoid in ergonomic setups.\nTurtle Beach Pure Air\nApart from the rather loud clicks, I was impressed with the build and performance of the Turtle Beach Pure Air. It’s lightweight, moves smoothly, and has impressively accurate cursor movements. But despite being labeled an ergonomic mouse, it’s particularly light on the ergonomics. There’s a divot for your right thumb, so it can't be called ambidextrous, but beyond that it’s a pretty standard (albeit quite nice) gaming mouse.\nPerixx Perimice 719\nThe PERIMICE-719 from Perixx is a solid mouse with an exterior that feels nice to the touch. It has a comfortable, semi-vertical design, accurate cursor moves and a satisfyingly ratcheted scroll wheel. Plus, it offers reliable connectivity with a wireless dongle and only costs $22. Unfortunately, it was too small for my hand. Only folks with smaller glove sizes (or don’t mind adopting more of a fingertip grip) will be able to get the most out of this one.\nAnker 2.4G vertical\nThe Anker 2.4G mouse could make a decent budget pick for anyone who doesn't mind using more of a pinch grip on their peripheral. It's lightweight and has a precise scroll wheel along with back and forward browser buttons. It's battery operated, but doesn't come with batteries and only connects via the included USB radio dongle. I also found the buttons a little harder to press which ultimately eliminated it from the running.  This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-ergonomic-mouse-120004931.html?src=rss",
    "full_text": "People dealing with conditions like carpal tunnel and wrist pain may be interested in finding the best ergonomic mouse for them. It’s distinct from ambidextrous mice that offer a standard oblong shape with less consideration for conforming to either hand. Clicking a vertical mouse feels more like pinching your finger and thumb together, which could relieve certain other wrist issues as well. As this guide focuses on productivity mice, gaming-specific stats like polling rates and IPS values don’t really come into play. (My colleague Jeff Dunn does a good job of explaining those metrics in his gaming mouse review guide.) Weight makes a difference in vertical and semi-vertical mice (but not trackballs, since they stay put). A lighter model will be easier to move around, which could put less strain on your wrist and arm. It's always nice to have easily clickable buttons, but that matters even more when body health is a concern.

Since taking over, Tan has enforced several cost-cutting measures, including cutting jobs with the goal of reducing its workforce by 22 percent by the end of the year.

The testing is being done with the goal of releasing a revamped Siri in the spring of 2026 that uses Apple's App Intents to expand what Siri can do outside of Apple's own OS and first-party apps. For instance, people might be able to post Instagram comments or make purchases using only their voice, something Siri can't yet do with most apps that Apple didn't develop itself, according to the report. Apple showed off a demo of this type of functionality last year, but the overhaul might not arrive until 2027. According to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, there are some internal doubts among Apple engineers as to whether the functionality will work well enough, especially in apps where mistakes could be costly or harmful, such as health or banking apps. Gurman points out that if the company gets it right, it would be a major feature that could give Apple, \"a new, voice-first interface... it could potentially be a hit that many users didn't see coming,\" he writes. Even if Apple succeeds in revamping Siri with new features that customers find to be a big improvement, the company will be doing so under pressure from competitors on the artificial intelligence front. Sharma expressed doubts that a spring 2026 release would include everything users might expect from a major Siri revamp. But if Apple can work its magic and make good on some of the features that it gave a glimpse of last year, the effects could be profound. \"With these capabilities, Siri could become a true AI assistant.'"

    "summary": "The closer we get to Apple's reveal of the iPhone 17 lineup, the more excited we are to see what's different from the previous iPhones. The newest smartphones will come equipped with the latest iOS 26 features. Since we still have to wait at least a month (presumably) until the iPhone event, we can at least speculate what the new phones will look like. As with most unreleased iPhone models, rumors and leaks have trickled in about the hardware side ahead of the official introduction. Here's what we're expecting and what we can reasonably assume we'll get from Cupertino in September.\nWhat are the latest iPhone 17 rumors and reports?\nWill the iPhone 17 Pro have better wireless signal strength thanks to an updated antenna design? That's the implication from Majin Bu, whom MacRumors classifies as a \"hit-or-miss leaker.\" The individual posted a render on X today (see below) that shows a new antenna system that wraps around the iPhone 17 Pro's supposedly wider rear camera bump.\niPhone 17 Pro New Antenna DesignFull Article:https://t.co/nivzKiY8xy pic.twitter.com/jgbwLteaPO— Majin Bu (@MajinBuOfficial) August 11, 2025\n\nAgain, this is a render, not a real-world photo, and — like all such stories ahead of the official announcement — should be treated with the usual grain of salt. That said, we can't knock the goal of better wireless reception, so we're hoping this one has a degree of truth to it.\nHow much will the iPhone 17 cost?\nApple's announced plan to expand US-based manufacturing partners seems to give it at least some shielding from the steepest Trump administration tariffs that have already triggered price increases on everything from Switch consoles to high-end cameras to Sonos speakers. But given that President Trump's trade policies can change from week to week, and Apple's continuing reliance on Asia-based supply chains, price shocks remain an ongoing possibility. The bigger question is: Will Apple absorb any higher costs, or pass them on to consumers? \nIf prices do creep up, Apple may choose to pair it it with an \"upgrade.\" Consider this recent rumor posted by MacRumors from a leaker known as \"Instant Digital,\" suggesting that the default storage of the iPhone 17 line may start at 256GB, doubling the current 128GB baseline. While that could be accompanied by a price increase of $50, Apple could at least pitch it as a \"better value.\" That said, the company doubled the default RAM of its Mac computers from 8GB to 16GB at no extra cost in 2024 — but that was before the current Trump tariff cycle started.\nWhen will the iPhone 17 series be announced?\nMost years, the flagship smartphones are introduced in September. MacRumors highlighted a story originally reported by iphone-ticker.de that the Apple iPhone 17 event could be Tuesday, September 9, according to information gleaned from German mobile phone providers.\nIt's still too early to have the specific dates; some years, Apple only gives a week or two of lead time between sending invites and hosting the event. But years of past precedent show that sometime in September should be when the 17 models make their debut. This family of smartphones may be the last to follow that trend, however. There have been hints that the introduction of the iPhone 18 collection in 2026 will be split into a pro-tier announcement in the fall and a standard model announcement the following spring.\nWhat will the new iPhone 17 lineup include?\nDesign leaks suggest that Apple is building an ultra-thin smartphone, likely to be named the iPhone 17 Air to match Apple's ultralight laptop designation. Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, often a solid source of advanced intel about Apple, reported in January that the iPhone 17 Air will be equipped with a basic A19 chip and will only have a single camera lens. It may also use Apple's new in-house modem, which was introduced in February on the iPhone 16e. More details about this development may leak ahead of September, but that's what we know for now.\nAn investor note from Apple analyst Jeff Pu indicated that the Air will have a titanium frame. If his reports are accurate, the lightweight smartphone will be the only entry in the iPhone 17 lineup to use that metal; the iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone 17 Pro Max are expected to be made of aluminum, which is oddly a lighter material than titanium. Other speculation had suggested that the Air would use a blend of aluminum and titanium, so the exact materials may not be known until the official announcement.\nAdditionally, an August 4 MacRumors report says the internal battery pack of the iPhone Air is just 2.49mm thick — half the thickness of the iPhone 17 Pro battery. The leak was posted on the Korean-langauge Naver blog, where they show the alleged batteries of the iPhone 17 Air and 17 Pro side by side. The same account claimed the 17 Air's battery capacity was a mere 2,800 mAh, MacRumors notes. (That's below the battery capacity of current iPhone 16 models.)\nEach new roster includes a base model, but over the years, Apple has shaken up the variety of phones it offers. Most likely there will be an iPhone 17 and an iPhone 17 Pro. Apple has also committed to the size matters philosophy, and has been building an iPhone Pro Max option with an even bigger screen and better battery life; the 17 roster will almost certainly have one as well. \nThe new Pro iPhones are said to have a full-width \"camera island\" on the rear, which would mark the first time an Apple model opted for that design. This feature can be seen in the purported iPhone 17 \"spotted in the wild.\" The pics, highlighted on MacRumors, show a black cased iPhone (17 Pro?) with the distinct back panel. Is it the real deal? The dual angles lend a degree of credibility in a social media landscape increasingly polluted with AI-enhanced fakes, but your guess is as good as ours.\nI just spotted a test development iPhone in the wild 🤩🤩🤩 pic.twitter.com/iS3PtKWqxJ— Fox Pupy 🦊🧡 (@Skyfops) July 28, 2025\n\nThe iPhone 17 Air seems primed to take the place of a potential iPhone 17 Plus. Since the iPhone 16e was only just introduced in February at a surprisingly high price point, it seems unlikely that there will be a new addition to that lower end of the spectrum, the models that were previously called SE. \nAt the very least, it sounds like the iPhone 17 Air won't take away the charging port and rely only on wireless connectivity. Bloomberg said that while Apple had investigated making the iPhone 17 Air without a single port, the company (fortunately) changed plans. He also says that the rumored phone will have a 6.6-inch screen and include the Dynamic Island and Camera Control button. Finally, the price is rumored at $900 — likely more than the standard iPhone 17 but less than the Pro.\nWe've also gotten what seems to be a reliable look at what the color lineup will be for the new smartphones. Macworld reported that the iPhone 17 will be available in black, white, steel gray, green, purple and light blue. The iPhone 17 Air will reportedly have four color options: black, white, light blue and light gold. While the Air colors will be less saturated, the visuals for the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max will go bold. The options for the Pro models are expected to be black, white, gray, dark blue and orange.\nOn July 30, Tom's Guide highlighted an X post from Sonny Dickson — a longtime and generally reliable leaker of unreleased iPhone information — showing \"dummy\" iPhone 17 models in the new colors that were the source of the aforementioned Macworld story. While these are literally just mock-ups — not real, leaked iPhones — it's interesting to see how the design and color rumors translate into a real-world look and feel.\nWhat will iOS 26 be like?\nApple upended its numbering conventions with WWDC 2025, and will match the name of each new operating system to the year it's released. So when the next wave of iPhones hits, they'll be running on iOS 26.\nOn the design side, the smartphone OS introduced during the big developer showcase took a contentious approach dubbed Liquid Glass. Apple has been scaling down the amount of transparency effects in the subsequent beta tests of iOS 26, but it will still have a glass-like visual.\nThe feature list includes big and small updates. On the more impactful side, the Phone and Photos apps have been redesigned. There will be several features leveraging artificial intelligence, such as live translation capabilities coming to Phone, FaceTime and Messages. Apple is also currently testing a sensitive content warning for child accounts that will freeze FaceTime video if nudity is detected by on-device machine learning tools. And the company is also launching Visual Intelligence, which will use AI to search for elements in an image.\niOS 26 also has a litany of minor, quality of life improvements. Group texts are getting support for polls. And for the slow risers out there, iOS 26 will finally let you escape the tyranny of the nine minute snooze alarm. \nThe next iOS is now available as a public beta. Here are our initial impressions of the Liquid Glass design and other new features. iOS 26 is compatible with all models back through iPhone 11.\nUpdate, August 11, 2025, 7:27PM ET: Added a render of a rumored new antenna design for the iPhone 17 Pro.\nUpdate, August 8, 2025, 4:43PM ET: Added new speculation and reports about iPhone 17 pricing.\nUpdate, August 6, 2025, 4:05PM ET: Added latest details about the potential iPhone 17 event date.\nUpdate, August 4, 2025, 5:23PM ET: Added latest battery leaks about the iPhone 17 models.\nUpdate, August 1, 2025, 8:15AM ET: Added new photos showing potential iPhone 17 colors.\nUpdate, July 30, 2025, 11:08AM ET: Added latest leaks and rumors about the iPhone 17, and updated information on the iOS 26 public beta.\nUpdate, July 17, 2025, 4:40PM ET: Added latest information about iOS 26, possible materials for the Air, and the color options for the different models.\nUpdate, March 17, 2025, 2PM ET: Added details about the rumored price and features of the iPhone 17 Air.\nUpdate, April 11, 2025, 3:45PM ET: Added details from Front Page Tech's new video that claims to reveal details from a leaked iOS 19 build.\nKatie Teague contributed to this story.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/iphone-17-release-is-rumored-for-september-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-thinnest-iphone-ever-and-the-apple-fall-event-153024456.html?src=rss",

But years of past precedent show that sometime in September should be when the 17 models make their debut. It may also use Apple's new in-house modem, which was introduced in February on the iPhone 16e. More details about this development may leak ahead of September, but that's what we know for now.

    "summary": "\nYour iPhone and iPad's operating systems are getting big upgrades this fall with the release of iOS 26 and iPadOS 26. My favorite coming to both is the visual update, called Liquid Glass — it's like the better-executed version of Windows Vista. We spent two weeks test-driving it — you can check out our detailed hands-on iOS 26 preview, or you can try it out yourself by downloading and installing the public beta. That software is a more stable iteration of the separate developer version, which recently hit the beta 6 waypoint, and offers a few more flashy features not yet available in the public version. (While the public beta is open to everyone and quite stable, always remember there's a degree of risk involved with beta software.) Not ready to upgrade your smartphone or tablet this year? No worries, we'll help you find out if your phone will be able to run iOS 26.\nWhile Apple didn't nix any iPhones from its eligibility list last year, that's not the case for 2025 — a few models are getting cut this time. All iPhone 8 models and the iPhone X were the last to get the boot in 2023, and this year the 2018 models are getting left behind. If you have an ineligible device, you won't be able to download iOS 26 when it becomes available this fall. \nWe'll get to the bottom of which iPhones and iPads will support iOS 26 and iPadOS 26 this year. To see what's coming with the latest OSes, check out everything announced at Apple's WWDC June 9 event. One thing you shouldn't immediately expect is Apple's updated version of Siri, though the company is reportedly working on a 'stripped-down' AI chatbot to compete with ChatGPT.\nThese three iPhones won't be compatible with iOS 26\nUnlike last year, several iPhone models won't be eligible to download the newest iOS when it makes its debut this fall. This trio of models first released in 2018 won't be coming to the iOS 26 party:\n\niPhone XR\niPhone XS\niPhone XS Max\n\niPhones compatible with iOS 26\nWhile we don't yet know the new iPhones Apple will be dropping this fall — though there are iPhone 17 rumors — we do know, per Apple's site, that the phones listed below will be compatible with iOS 26. Basically, if you have an iPhone that was announced in 2019 or later, you're in the clear:\n\niPhone SE (second generation or later)\niPhone 11\niPhone 11 Pro\niPhone 11 Pro Max\niPhone 12\niPhone 12 mini\niPhone 12 Pro\niPhone 12 Pro Max\niPhone 13\niPhone 13 mini\niPhone 13 Pro\niPhone 13 Pro Max\niPhone 14\niPhone 14 Plus\niPhone 14 Pro\niPhone 14 Pro Max\niPhone 15\niPhone 15 Plus\niPhone 15 Pro\niPhone 15 Pro Max\niPhone 16e\niPhone 16\niPhone 16 Plus\niPhone 16 Pro\niPhone 16 Pro Max\n\niPads compatible with iPadOS 26\nThe iPads listed below, and any iPads released later this year, are eligible to download iPadOS 26.\n\niPad Pro (M4)\niPad Pro 12.9‑inch (3rd generation and later)\niPad Pro 11‑inch (1st generation and later)\niPad Air (M3, M2)\niPad Air (3rd generation and later)\niPad (A16)\niPad (8th generation and later)\niPad mini (A17 Pro)\niPad mini (5th generation and later)\n\nWhat if I don't want to buy a new iPhone?\nIf you want to continue using your older iPhone that isn't supported by iOS 26, that's fine. However, you'll miss out on security updates which could potentially put your phone at risk for malware and other threats. Additionally, some apps may stop working if they require a certain version of iOS or later. And of course, you won't be able to access the latest features iOS 26 offers.\nWhen will iOS 26 become available?\nApple usually rolls out its latest iOS in mid-September, just a few days before the new iPhones hit store shelves. Last year, it released iOS 18 on Monday, Sept. 16. Expect a confirmation of the release date at the iPhone 17 event, expected in early September. \niOS 26 features we're excited about\nLiquid Glass design: Your home screen is getting revamped with new app icons, including dark mode and all-clear options. You'll also notice buttons with a new floating design. Liquid Glass was designed to make all of Apple's OSes more cohesive.\nPhone app redesign: You'll finally be able to scroll through contacts, recent calls and voicemail messages all on one screen. It also comes with a new feature called Hold Assist that'll notify you when an agent comes to the phone so you can avoid the elevator music.\nLive Translate: iOS 26 is bringing the ability to have a conversation via phone call or text message with someone who speaks another language. Live Translate will translate your conversation in real time. \nPolls feature: Coming to group messages in the Messages app, chat members will be able to create polls. This can help prevent the unwanted 30+ messages when it comes to deciding which restaurant you're meeting at this weekend.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/ready-for-apples-ios-26-here-are-all-the-compatible-iphones-that-can-run-the-beta-today-191854135.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Liquid Glass is a huge new change coming to iOS 26. (Apple)\nIn just over a month, we'll finally get to download the official iOS 26 on our iPhones. Available now is the iOS 26 developer beta 6 (for developers only), and the public beta which you can download and install now. CEO Tim Cook recently said it's (along with the other current beta operating systems) \"by far the most popular developer betas we’ve had,\" 9to5Mac reports. You can also take a look at our preview of the iOS 26 public beta release, which shows off the fresh home and lock screen redesign. Called Liquid Glass, the new translucent look will extend across all of Apple's upcoming operating systems. The overhaul is one of several big changes coming to iOS, macOS, iPadOS and the rest of Apple's software suite, all of which were showcased during the company's WWDC keynote on June 9.\nAfter overpromising on AI plans last year, Apple kept its iOS roadmap focused more on basic quality of life improvements this year. There are multiple useful additions coming to the Phone and Messages apps on your iPhone, for instance: Apple execs outlined the ability to weed out spam texts or other unknown senders and an option to hold your spot on a phone call when you've been waiting for a representative to pick up. Plus, a treasured feature that we took for granted is coming back (hint: it's in the Photos app).\nSiri, meanwhile, is in a holding pattern. Apple has previously specified that its smarter voice assistant — first promised at WWDC 2024 — is delayed until some point \"in the coming year,\" so you shouldn't expect any major changes in the current betas. But there are reports that Apple is aiming to give Siri a bigger brain transplant by basing it on third-party artificial intelligence models like OpenAI's ChatGPT or Anthropic's Claude, which could make 2026 a pivotal year. The company is also reportedly working on a 'stripped-down' AI chatbot to rival ChatGPT.\nWith each beta, it seems like additional new improvements are popping up, like this FaceTime feature that'll freeze your video if it detects nudity. With the release of the iOS 26 developer beta 5, we saw more added features, like a new bouncy animation on the passcode screen and in the Control Center, MacRumors reports. Some or all of those changes will likely soon migrate into the separate public beta (see below). Most newer iPhone models are eligible to download iOS 26 (both the betas and final version). Want to see the full list of new features coming this fall? Read on. \nWhat is iOS 26?\nThe current iPhone operating system is iOS 18, and Apple is still actively updating it — version 18.6 was just recently released. But don't expect to see iOS 19. Instead, Apple is skipping the numbering ahead to iOS 26 later this year. The company has decided to line up its iOS version numbers with a year-based system, similar to car model years. So while iOS and its sibling operating systems will be released in late 2025, they're all designated \"26\" to reflect the year ahead. \nIt's official, we're moving to iOS 26. (Apple)\nWhat is Liquid Glass design?\nLet's be honest. Out of everything announced at WWDC this year, the new Liquid Glass design was the star of the show. The iPhone's home and lock screens have looked pretty much the same year after year — the last exciting thing (in my opinion) was the option to add your own aesthetic to your home screen by customizing your apps and widgets. So seeing the home and lock screens' new facelift is refreshing.\nSo what exactly is Liquid Glass? Apple calls it a \"new translucent material\" since, well, the apps and widgets are clear. However, the screen can still adapt to dark and light modes, depending on surroundings. You'll also notice buttons with a new floating design in several apps, like Phone and Maps. They're designed to be less distracting than the current buttons, but are still easy to see. While the design overhaul has proven to be controversial since its announcement, some — including Engadget's own Devindra Hardawar — like the new direction, even if it's somewhat reminiscent of Microsoft's translucent Windows Vista Aero designs from nearly twenty years ago.\nThat said, as of the release of the iOS 26 beta 2, Apple has already incorporated some user feedback into the design, dialing back the transparency in at least some places. And while it will continue to evolve, Apple users won't be able to escape it: Liquid Glass was designed to make all of Apple's OSes more cohesive. Here's a look at how the translucent aesthetic will look with the new macOS Tahoe 26 on your desktop.\nWhat are the new and notable features of iOS 26?\niOS 26 has a laundry list of new features. Among the most worthwhile:\nPhone app redesign: You'll finally be able to scroll through contacts, recent calls and voicemail messages all on one screen. It also comes with a new feature called Hold Assist that'll notify you when an agent comes to the phone so you can avoid the elevator music and continue on with other tasks.\nLive Translation in Phone, FaceTime and Messages: iOS 26 is bringing the ability to have a conversation via phone call or text message with someone who speaks another language. Live Translation will translate your conversation in real time, which results in some stop-and-go interactions in the examples Apple shared during its presentation.\nPolls in group chats: Tired of sorting through what seems like hundreds of messages in your group chat? You and your friends will soon be able to create polls in group messages for deciding things like which brunch spot you're eating at or whose car you're taking on a road trip.\nFiltering unknown senders in Messages: If you haven't received spam texts about unpaid tolls or other citations, you're lucky. For those of us who have, those annoying messages will soon be filtered away in a separate folder.\nVisual Intelligence: Similar to a reverse Google image search, this new feature will allow you to search for anything that's on your iPhone screen. For instance, if you spot a pair of shoes someone is wearing in an Instagram photo, you can screenshot it and use Visual Intelligence to find those shoes (or similar ones) online.\nPhotos tabs are back: For anyone who's still frustrated with the Photos changes made last year, you'll be happy to know that your tabs are coming back. Library and Collections will have their own separate spaces so you don't have to scroll to infinity to find what you're looking for.\nFaceTime \"Communication Safety\" feature: A newer addition to iOS 26 appears to be the FaceTime \"Communication Safety\" feature that pauses communications if and when nudity is detected. The feature appears to be a child safety feature that uses on-device detection, thus obviating any cloud-based privacy issues. \nNew lock screen options: The iPhone lock screen gets more customizable in iOS 26, with a cooler clock, 3D wallpaper effects, more widgets and better focus mode options. \nApple's Hold Assist will be nifty for those pesky services that put you on hold for 10 or more minutes. (Apple)\nNew changes coming to iPadOS 26\nYour iPad isn't getting left behind when it comes to big updates. Here's what's coming this fall.\nMultitasking and real windowing: When you download the newest update, you'll be able to have multiple apps running on your screen at the same time. Once you open an app, it'll appear on your screen as normal but you'll be able to resize and move it across your screen to make room for other apps. This feature is optional so you can turn it off if you don't like it.\nVisual update: Along with the other new OSes, iPadOS 26 is coming with the Liquid Glass aesthetic. This new look will appear on the lock and home screens, as well as the drop-down menus.\nNew menu bar: When you swipe down on your screen, the new menu bar will appear with options like File, Edit, Windows and more. There's also a search option if you're looking for something specific.\nCheckout our first impressions of iPadOS 26. \nWhat about AirPods?\nAirPods are also getting updated with iOS 26. Here are some of the more notable functions.\nEnhanced audio recording: Apple calls this \"studio-quality\" audio recording, and with it, you'll notice more clarity while in noisy environments.\nCamera remote control: Using this, you can take a photo or start and stop video recording with just one press on your AirPods. When taking photos, you'll get a three-second countdown before your iPhone or iPad snaps the picture.\nWhich iPhones will be able to upgrade to iOS 26?\nA few iPhone models that run the current version of iOS — iPhone XR, XS and XS Max — won't be compatible with the latest upgrade. But any iPhones released in 2019 or later will be eligible for the iOS 26 update.\n\niPhone SE (second generation or later)\niPhone 11\niPhone 11 Pro\niPhone 11 Pro Max\niPhone 12\niPhone 12 mini\niPhone 12 Pro\niPhone 12 Pro Max\niPhone 13\niPhone 13 mini\niPhone 13 Pro\niPhone 13 Pro Max\niPhone 14\niPhone 14 Plus\niPhone 14 Pro\niPhone 14 Pro Max\niPhone 15\niPhone 15 Plus\niPhone 15 Pro\niPhone 15 Pro Max\niPhone 16e\niPhone 16\niPhone 16 Plus\niPhone 16 Pro\niPhone 16 Pro Max\n\nNot listed here are the presumed new iPhone 17 models (or maybe iPhone 26?) that are all but certain to be announced and released in September. \nHow to install iOS 26 beta\nThe iOS 26 public beta is now available to download via the Apple Beta Software Program. If you're not already a member, you'll need to sign up to try out all the latest features. Just visit beta.apple.com and sign up with your phone number or email address. It's free.\nOnce you're in, you can install it by going to Settings > General > Software Update and selecting iOS 26 public beta. \nA word of caution: Don't sign up with your main iPhone unless you're OK with any risks that occur with using an OS that isn't finalized.\nWhen will the final version of iOS 26 be released?\niOS 26 will be released to the public this fall. It usually comes in September, within a week of the Apple iPhone event. Last year, it rolled out to iPhone users on September 16 — exactly one week after the iPhone 16 lineup was announced.\nIf you're more interested in the Apple Intelligence features coming, here's everything Apple revealed for iOS, macOS and more during WWDC.

    "summary": "The latest example of bias permeating artificial intelligence comes from the medical field. A new study surveyed real case notes from 617 adult social care workers in the UK and found that when large language models summarized the notes, they were more likely to omit language such as \"disabled,\" \"unable\" or \"complex\" when the patient was tagged as female, which could lead to women receiving insufficient or inaccurate medical care.\nResearch led by the London School of Economics and Political Science ran the same case notes through two LLMs — Meta's Llama 3 and Google's Gemma — and swapped the patient's gender, and the AI tools often provided two very different patient snapshots. While Llama 3 showed no gender-based differences across the surveyed metrics, Gemma had significant examples of this bias. Google's AI summaries produced disparities as drastic as \"Mr Smith is an 84-year-old man who lives alone and has a complex medical history, no care package and poor mobility\" for a male patient, while the same case notes with credited to a female patient provided: \"Mrs Smith is an 84-year-old living alone. Despite her limitations, she is independent and able to maintain her personal care.\" \nRecent research has uncovered biases against women in the medical sector, both in clinical research and in patient diagnosis. The stats also trend worse for racial and ethnic minorities and for the LGBTQ community. It's the latest stark reminder that LLMs are only as good as the information they are trained on and the people deciding how they are trained. The particularly concerning takeaway from this research was that UK authorities have been using LLMs in care practices, but without always detailing which models are being introduced or in what capacity.\n\"We know these models are being used very widely and what’s concerning is that we found very meaningful differences between measures of bias in different models,” lead author Dr. Sam Rickman said, noting that the Google model was particularly likely to dismiss mental and physical health issues for women. \"Because the amount of care you get is determined on the basis of perceived need, this could result in women receiving less care if biased models are used in practice.

This contract begins in 2026 and covers the organization's full slate of 13 marquee bouts and 30 Fight Night events per year. All matches and events will stream in the US on Paramount+ and select fights will simulcast on CBS.\nThis ends the pay-per-view (PPV) model that ESPN+ has favored for premium UFC events. \"What’s on pay-per-view anymore? Boxing? Movies on DirecTV? It’s an outdated, antiquated model,\" said Mark Shapiro, president of UFC's parent company TKO Group.

The company coughed up $16 million to settle a \"frivolous and dangerous\" lawsuit with Trump after 60 Minutes interviewed Kamala Harris and cut an answer for time, which is something televised interviews have always done. Paramount will allocate that money to Trump's future presidential library and did not provide a \"statement of apology or regret.\"\n\nCBS, which is owned by Paramount, also canceled The Late Show With Stephen Colbert, which was seen by many as a move to pacify Trump.

    "summary": "It goes without saying that Apple devices tend to be fairly high-quality — the company's gear currently occupies the top spots in several of our buying guides, from laptops and tablets to smartphones and smartwatches. As a result, that gear usually doesn't come cheap. But that doesn’t mean you always have to pay full price. Good Apple deals are often out there, so long as you know where to look.To make things easier, we're keeping a running list of the best Apple deals you can shop right now on AirPods, MacBooks, iPads and more. Just note that you’ll almost always find the best Apple deals from third-party retailers like Amazon, Best Buy, Walmart, Target and the like, not from Apple's own online store. Unless you shop refurbished, you’ll usually pay top dollar buying direct (though for some items like iPhones, that might be the best route to take).\nBest iPad deals\n \nApple iPad Air (13-inch, M3) for $649 ($150 off): Engadget's Nathan Ingraham gave the 13-inch iPad Air a score of 89 when it was released in March. It has a bigger and slightly brighter display than its 11-inch counterpart; otherwise, the two slates are the same. If you plan to keep your iPad hooked up to a keyboard, the extra screen space is lovely for taking in movies and multitasking for work. This is another new low, and again, all color and storage configs are on sale. \nApple iPad Pro (13-inch, M4) for $1,099 ($200 off): The most powerful iPad is the iPad Pro. Both the 11- and 13-inch models have gorgeous 120Hz OLED displays, thinner and lighter designs, a repositioned front camera and the excessively powerful M4 chip inside. This 13-inch version is pricey, but it may be worth the extra cost if you plan to multitask regularly or just want more screen space for enjoying movies. While this isn't the absolute largest discount we've seen, it's a solid drop all the same. Be aware, though, that reports have said that Apple could release a new iPad Pro by the end of the year. Also at Target and Best Buy.\nApple iPad mini (A17 Pro) for $399 ($100 off): The iPad mini is exactly what it sounds like: the smaller iPad. This latest iteration has an improved A17 Pro chip — which is enough to support Apple Intelligence — along with 128GB of storage in the base model and Apple Pencil Pro support. As before, you’d buy it if you value the smaller 8.3-inch display and want a tablet you can more easily hold with one hand. This deal is $20 more than the lowest price we've tracked. Also at Target and Best Buy.\nBest MacBook deals\n \nApple MacBook Air (15-inch, M4) for $999 ($200 off): The 15-inch MacBook Air is nearly identical to the smaller version but features more robust speakers and a more spacious trackpad alongside its roomier display. $999 is the lowest price we've tracked.\nApple MacBook Air (15-inch, M3, 24GB RAM) for $1,199 ($500 off): The last-gen M3 MacBook Air has officially been discontinued, but it remains a superb laptop while stock remains available. We gave this 15-inch model a score of 90 in our review — outside of its slower chip (which is still plenty fast for everyday use), marginally improved camera and inability to power two external displays with the lid open, it's virtually identical to the newer version. This deal applies to the model with the larger 24GB of memory in the Starlight colorway.\nBest AirPods deals\n \nApple AirPods Pro 2 for $169 ($80 off): The AirPods Pro 2 are Apple’s best set of wireless earbuds for now, as they offer the full set of Apple-focused features, strong ANC, onboard volume controls, a comfy in-ear design and a warm sound profile that most should find agreeable. They can even work as a hearing aid, though their six-hour battery life still isn’t the best, and you should only get them if you’re all-in on Apple hardware. But if that’s the case, we consider them the best wireless earbuds for iPhone owners. This deal is $20 off the all-time low we saw last month, but it's still a ways below the set's usual going rate. Also at Walmart and Best Buy. Exercise caution, though: If you're not in a rush, this is another Apple device that may see a refresh within the next couple of months.\nBest Apple Watch deals\n \nApple Watch Ultra 2 for $650 ($149 off): Apple’s most premium smartwatch, the Ultra 2 has a killer 36-hour battery life, a handy Low Power mode for extended use and cellular connectivity by default. It also has a compass app, water temperature gauge and a loud onboard siren that you can trigger in emergencies. This discount marks the lowest price we've tracked. But again, we wouldn't be surprised if Apple introduced an updated model in the coming weeks.\nApple Watch SE (GPS, 40mm) for $169 ($80 off): As with the more premium models, we wouldn’t be surprised to see an update to Apple’s budget smartwatch sometime soon (and we have a few suggestions on the matter). But thanks to some serious discounts, the Apple Watch SE has turned out to be the most affordable way to get an iPhone companion for your wrist. Despite a lackluster screen and limited extra features, it handles the basics well. Also at Target.\nBest Apple accessories deals\n \nApple Pencil (USB-C) for $69 ($10 off): This more affordable Apple Pencil doesn’t support pressure sensitivity, but it still makes for a useful stylus for the basics. If you’re a casual note-taker and can live without wireless charging, you’ll save a few bucks by picking this one up. Also at Walmart and Best Buy.\nRead more Apple coverage:\n\nThe best AirPods\nThe best Apple Watches\nThe best MacBooks\nThe best iPhones\nThe best iPads\n\nFollow @EngadgetDeals on X for the latest tech deals and buying advice.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/best-apple-deals-150020110.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Unlike two of its biggest rivals, Sony waited until April to unveil its latest soundbars rather than debut them at CES in January. And even then, the two most premium options in the company’s 2025 lineup remain untouched. Instead, Sony gave us the Bravia Theater Bar 6 ($650): a 3.1.2-channel Dolby Atmos soundbar that comes with a wireless subwoofer and a modest set of features. However, the caveats here are real headscratchers, especially on a soundbar launching this year.\n \nWhat’s good about the Bravia Theater Bar 6?\nOverall sound quality has never been an issue on the Sony soundbars I’ve tested, and the Theater Bar 6 continues with that trend. You can expect crisp, warm sound with excellent clarity and solid directional audio. Even over Bluetooth, this speaker-sub combo is great for music, doing justice to the subtle details of Miles Davis’ Mies ‘54: The Prestige Recordings. Classic jazz is a great way to judge a speaker’s merits, and on the Bar 6, this recently remastered album is dynamic and inviting throughout all 20 tracks. \nThe soundbar also delivered great audio in movies and TV. I was sucked into battle scenes during the second season of Andor, even though the limitations of the Theater Bar 6’s 3.1.2-channel configuration quickly became apparent. Its five-driver arrangement does well, thanks to three front-firing units and two angled up-firing speakers. Those latter two components really help with filling the overhead space during the action in shows like Andor, compensating for the limited number of drivers (and their positioning) as much as possible. And all of that makes the Theater Bar 6 a solid option for smaller spaces, especially if you have lower ceilings and won’t be sitting far from the TV.\nThe Theater Bar 6 won’t win any design awards, but that’s okay. There are plenty of people, myself included, who don’t really want their soundbar to stand out on the TV stand or mantle. The focus should be the display, not the speaker. This model is quite plain, but it also has a relatively low profile, so even if your TV has a short stand, the Theater Bar 6 won’t block the picture.\nWhat’s not so great about the Bravia Theater Bar 6?\n\n\n\n\n   Billy Steele for Engadget \n \n\nThe first strike against the Bravia Theater Bar 6 is the lack of Wi-Fi connectivity. If you want a wireless connection to the soundbar, Bluetooth is your only option. What’s more, no Wi-Fi means no AirPlay, Chromecast or Spotify Connect — all of which should be standard on a $650 model in 2025. Sony did make it easy to switch from the HDMI input over to Bluetooth in the Bravia Connect app, and that change happens quickly after you’ve paired your phone with the soundbar once.\nSpeaking of the app, it doesn’t actually help you install firmware updates to the Theater Bar 6. Instead, it prompts you to transfer the files from a computer to a thumb drive to get them to the soundbar. Yes, really. Sony says the lack of Wi-Fi is why this workaround is required. No matter the reason, having to dig a thumb drive out of your junk drawer to install updates is a big inconvenience, and it shouldn’t really be a thing in the mid 2020s.\nIn the sound department, the only real knock against the Theater Bar 6 is more about the constraints of 3.1.2-channel audio. Even with Dolby Atmos and DTS:X content, this system will be limited in its abilities to deliver immersive sound. Sure, Sony’s S-Fore Pro and Vertical Surround Engine do well to virtualize a more robust living room setup, but that tech only goes so far.\nYou might think a pair of rear speakers would bolster the sound, and Sony does offer the Bravia Theater System 6 ($770) as a 5.1-channel all-in-one package. However, it doesn’t include the Theater Bar 6 and its subwoofer. Instead, that bundle comes with a different soundbar that doesn’t have up-firing drivers, which means it might lack overhead sound and dampen the impact of immersive content. Unfortunately, if you want to add rear speakers to the Theater Bar 6, you’re out of luck. None of Sony’s currently available options are compatible with this soundbar.\nLastly, and this isn’t a huge issue for most people, but the Theater Bar 6’s included subwoofer is big. Bigger than most of the competition? No, but it’s large nonetheless. I’ll admit I’ve been spoiled by the QS700F that I recently reviewed, thanks to its subwoofer’s compact design. But if speakers in this category start trending smaller, the one that accompanies the Bar 6 will definitely end up being one of the chunkier models.\nWrap-up\n\n\n\n   The up-firing speakers assist with Dolby Atmos.  \n \n\n   Billy Steele for Engadget \n \n\nFrom a pure sound quality standpoint, the Theater Bar 6 excels at both its music and TV duties. Sure, it’s limited by its 3.1.2-channel configuration, but there’s a definite use case for that type of setup — especially if you’re short on living room space. The audio is crisp and clear, and it’s also warm and inviting, which makes this soundbar well-suited for all kinds of content.\nDespite my heaping on all of that praise, the Bar 6 simply has too many drawbacks that I can’t overlook. The lack of Wi-Fi on a $650 soundbar is absurd, mostly because it strips users of the convenience of AirPlay, Chromecast and other wireless connection options. I also can’t get over the need to use a thumb drive for updates when OTA downloads for new firmware have been the norm on soundbars for years.\nFor those reasons, the Samsung QS700F is the better option in this price range since it combines great sound with an orientation feature that automatically recofigures the output direction based on placement. Sony and Samsung are in a tight race in regards to audio performance with the Theater Bar 6 and the QS700F, but only one of those 2025 soundbars will save you from some headaches.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/sony-bravia-theater-bar-6-review-great-sound-greater-frustration-144512450.html?src=rss",
    "full_text": "Dedicated center speaker for enhanced dialogue Cons Doesn’t support AirPlay, Chromecast or Spotify Connect You can expect crisp, warm sound with excellent clarity and solid directional audio. Classic jazz is a great way to judge a speaker’s merits, and on the Bar 6, this recently remastered album is dynamic and inviting throughout all 20 tracks. Its five-driver arrangement does well, thanks to three front-firing units and two angled up-firing speakers. If you want a wireless connection to the soundbar, Bluetooth is your only option. Even with Dolby Atmos and DTS:X content, this system will be limited in its abilities to deliver immersive sound. However, it doesn’t include the Theater Bar 6 and its subwoofer. None of Sony’s currently available options are compatible with this soundbar. From a pure sound quality standpoint, the Theater Bar 6 excels at both its music and TV duties. Sony and Samsung are in a tight race in regards to audio performance with the Theater Bar 6 and the QS700F, but only one of those 2025 soundbars will save you from some headaches."

    "summary": "Despite the impending loss of federal rebates, Ford plans to give US EV production a huge boost. After hyping it last week as a \"breakthrough\" and \"Model T moment,\" the company has announced the Ford Universal EV Platform to be shared by a new family of products. The first of those will be a midsized pickup with a starting price of around $30,000, likely similar in configuration to the popular Maverick. It will use the company's upcoming prismatic LFP (lithium iron phosphate) batteries. \nFord will invest $5 billion, including $2 billion at its Louisville, Kentucky factory on top of $3 billion already announced for its BlueOval battery plant. It will expand the Louisville facility by 52,000 square feet and \"create or secure\" nearly 4,000 direct jobs, Ford added. \nFord's only two EVs right now are the F-150 Lightning and Mustang Mach-E, both of which use one-off platforms. With the Universal EV Platform, Ford will be able to build multiple vehicles including vans, cars and pickups that should be easier to build and thus cheaper. \"The result: a simple, efficient, flexible ecosystem to deliver a family of affordable, electric, software-defined vehicles,\" the company said. \nFord said that the platform will reduce parts by 20 percent versus a typical vehicle, with fewer fasteners and workstations and a 15 percent quicker assembly time. The company is also promising a lower cost of ownership over five years \"than a three-year-old used Tesla Model Y.\" \nFord\nThe company also touted its LFP prismatic batteries as enabling space and weight savings along with cost reductions, due to the cobalt-free and nickel-free composition. However, the company's choice of LFP for its next-gen EVs has not been without controversy. Since Ford is licensing tech from China's CATL, it may lose out on tax credits of up to $700 million if Congress passes a bill banning federal support for battery plants that use tech or materials from China. \nThe first vehicle will be a mid-sized four-door electric pickup set to launch in 2027. Ford hasn't yet revealed the name or shown a photo, but it will supposedly have more room than Toyota's latest RAV4 without even counting the frunk and truck bed. Buyers will be able to lock gear like bikes or surfboards into that bed, eliminating the need for roof or trailer hitch racks. It will have a low center of gravity from the battery, instant torque and a 0 to 60 mph time \"as fast as a Mustang EcoBoost [around 4.5 seconds], with more downforce,\" Ford said.\nFord hasn't detailed other vehicles that will be built on the platform, but an animation shows a variety ranging from utility vans to crossovers to SUVs to sedans, along with the aforementioned pickup. One rumor states that the new pickup could be called the Ranchero (based on a trademark filing) or it may use the Ranger name. In any case, it's clearly a big deal for Ford, since the company will have no less than three announcements for it. More info for the midsized electric truck, including reveal date, starting price, battery range and charge times \"will be communicated later,\" Ford simply said. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/ford-is-developing-a-30000-midsized-ev-pickup-143030877.html?src=rss",

A surge protector power strip like this one from Anker can eliminate that problem by giving them eight AC outlets to use simultaneously, along with two USb-A ports and one USB-C connector. They’ll be able to charge up their laptop and phone at the same time, and have plenty of extra options if they also need to power a portable monitor or a tablet, or recharge a pair of headphones before they head home for the day. The USB-C port on this device also supports 20W fast-charging, which will be useful when they need to top up a dying smartphone.

    "full_text": "Mario Kart is a proven formula, and Nintendo has done more than enough to make MKW the kind of game that millions of people will play over the next decade or so. There are a ton of cleverly-designed new tracks that you can pick up and play immediately — but the more time you put into them, the more shortcuts and secrets you’ll find to help master them. There’s a truckload of Nintendo characters to pilot your kart or bike, from the heavy hitters to bizarre but amusing choices like a Piranha plant. But while Mario Kart World will feel familiar to the millions who played Mario Kart 8, it also introduces a few noteworthy new features. One is that the majority of courses don’t have you doing three laps around a track — instead, you’re driving from point A to point B, with every track being set in a part of a larger world (hence the name). You can cruise from one side of the map to the other, looking for little bonus challenges, unlocking more outfits for your characters and finding other collectibles. The fact that you can’t cruise around free roam in multiplayer mode is a major bummer, and the world itself feels somewhat deserted as a result, but there’s still a ton to do here. This is probably my favorite part — it’s an ongoing race across six courses with five checkpoints along the way. At each checkpoint, you have to be higher than a certain ranking or you’ll be eliminated. While I wish Nintendo took just a few more risks with Mario Kart World, it’s the kind of game anyone can pick up and have a blast with."

According to Gurman, the company is testing App Intents with its own apps, but also third-party apps, including AllTrails, Amazon, Facebook, Threads, Temu, Uber, WhatsApp and YouTube. For apps that handle more sensitive info, like banking apps, Gurman said that Apple may look into certain restrictions or completely avoid these apps for App Intents.\nApple gave us the first glimpse of this smarter Siri during WWDC 2024, where Apple Intelligence was the focus of the annual conference.

    "summary": "DJI's obstacle avoidance system could be just as useful on land as it is in the air. DJI, known for its dominance in the drone market, has entered the smart home world with a range of robot vacuums called ROMO. Beyond its drones, gimbals and action cameras, the Chinese company previously branched out into other product categories, including portable power stations and e-bikes.\nFor those wondering why DJI settled on robot vacuums as its next venture, it makes sense considering the company's \"omnidirectional obstacle sensing\" found in its drones. The same system that helps DJI drones avoid crashes when capturing cinematic footage easily translates into a robot vacuum that can navigate a home without running into furniture. Along with obstacle detection that can measure down to millimeters, DJI built its ROMO models with two flexible cleaning arms, an extremely high 25,000 Pa suction and a base station that the vacuum will automatically dock and clean itself in.\nTo make it more efficient, DJI packed in machine learning algorithms that help the ROMO vacuums figure out the best route for cleaning. The onboard intelligence can even detect if an area is especially dirty and spend more time there. To make it less of a nuisance, the ROMO uses a noise reduction system while vacuuming and you can control it hands-free with voice commands.\nDJI\nDJI is offering the ROMO in three models: the entry-level ROMO S that starts at around $650, the midrange ROMO A with a transparent vacuum design that goes for around $750 and the top-of-the-line ROMO P that has both a transparent vacuum and base station for at least $950. DJI is releasing the ROMO to China first, but says overseas availability is coming later this year. While robot vacuums don't pose as much of a security risk as drones, DJI is currently trying to figure out how to avoid a ban in the US when the National Defense Authorization Act goes into effect at the end of this year. Unless DJI is audited and cleared by one of the US' national security agencies by then, any new DJI drones would be blocked from being imported or sold in the US.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/dji-repurposed-its-drones-obstacle-detection-tech-for-robot-vacuums-191136030.html?src=rss",

On Reddit, Altman responded to a question by saying GPT-5's writing quality is better than previous models, but asked users if this felt true. In response, several Redditors voiced their opinion that the GPT-5 felt \"sterile\" and \"much worse\" and answered \"briefly and dryly.\" In response to the initial outcry, Altman posted on X that OpenAI would let Plus subscribers choose between using GPT-5 or GPT-4o.\n\"We for sure underestimated how much some of the things that people like in GPT-4o matter to them, even if GPT-5 performs better in most ways,\" Altman said on X.\nThe return of GPT-4o was celebrated, but there's still no guarantee that OpenAI will keep its older model around indefinitely.

    "summary": "Welcome to our latest recap of what's going on in the indie game space. This week, Nintendo held its latest Indie World showcase to spotlight titles that are coming to Switch and Switch 2, as well as some that arrived on the eShop on the day of the presentation.\nOne of the latter was UFO 50, which featured on many best of 2024 lists after it debuted on PC. Another was Is This Seat Taken?, which is about placing picky people in the right seats. This chill puzzle game from Poti Poti Studio and publisher Wholesome Games Presents arrived on Steam, iOS and Android as well this week. It has a look that reminds me a little of last year’s pretty platformer, Schim.\n\nLooking further ahead, the Indie World revealed the October release date for Ball x Pit, a Breakout-esque roguelite I'm very excited for. In addition, Mina the Hollower, the next game from Shovel Knight studio Yacht Club Games that we already knew was coming to Steam on Halloween, has been confirmed for a Switch and Switch 2 release on the same day.\n\nThe showcase also revealed that Neverway, a creepy life-sim RPG from a studio founded by Pedro Medeiros (the pixel artist of Celeste) and Murder Engine creator Isadora Sophia, is coming to Switch and Steam in 2026. Meanwhile, sci-fi RPG Caves of Qud is coming to Switch as a console exclusive later this year. This is a turn-based, sci-fi roguelike RPG from Freehold Games and publisher Kitfox Games that's rated overwhelmingly positive on Steam after nearly 10,000 player reviews (a quick scan indicates that those who get into Caves of Qud can sink hundreds of hours into it).\nElsewhere, The International Game Developers Association, The International Game Developers Association Foundation and Women in Games International teamed up for an interesting announcement this week. The organizations are collaborating on a project called Port Quest, which is designed to help successful developers bring their games to mobile platforms. Studios who take part can receive assistance from industry veterans, access to workshops and more.\nApplications are open now and will close on September 15. Those chosen to participate will be featured in a showcase. However, only games that have earned at least $10,000 per month for the last six months are eligible. The games can't have previously been made available on mobile devices either.\nNew releases\n\nA game called Ritual of Raven, from Spellgarden Games and publisher Team17, arrived on Steam and Switch this week. It's billed as a \"cozy, story-based farming sim\" but you're not going to be making your character till the land, plant seeds and carefully nurture crops here. \nInstead, this is more of a deckbuilder, as you'll collect tarot cards and make use of their magical powers to do the work for you. It seems like an interesting twist on the Stardew Valley formula, especially if you're into card-based games.\n\nKimchi: A Stars in the Trash Story is a free, short game from Valhalla Cats that dropped this week on Steam and Itch.io — just in time for International Cat Day. As a kitten named Kimchi, you'll explore a cat museum and solve puzzles as you learn about the history of cats.\nThis is a spinoff of Stars in the Trash, a hand-drawn platform adventure with a gorgeous aesthetic that came out late last year. I bought that game months ago but haven't gotten around to playing it. The arrival of Kimchi is a good reminder for me to do that.\n\nI mentioned this one in a previous edition of this roundup, though I can't help but highlight it again (not least because I feel the need to switch things up after highlighting a couple of cozy games). Turbo Kid is a delightfully gory Metroidvania that acts as a quasi-sequel to a film of the same name that I utterly adore. It finally landed on Switch this week, alongside an update for a PC update that enhances a lot of the weapons and makes them easier to acquire. Outerminds says the update also brings performance improvements to lower-spec systems.\nUpcoming\n\nA foraging adventure called Out and About was supposed to debut this week, but it's been pushed back by a few days as Yaldi Games unfortunately didn't check the Early Access box in Steam's publishing tools. As such, the studio has had to delay the game's arrival until this Monday. That's a bit of a pity for a developer that's releasing its first-ever game, but Yaldi's transparency here is quite endearing.\nIn any case, Out and About will see you gathering fungi and wild plants to help you cook delectable dishes and put together herbal remedies. You'll also be helping to rebuild your community following a powerful storm. The game features real-life plants, so you might learn how to identify flora when you're out and about in the real world and perhaps do some actual foraging of your own.\n\nRogue Labyrinth looks absolutely gorgeous, with a look that reminds me of my favorite game of all time, The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past. In this story-driven action title from Tea Witch Games and publisher indie.io, you'll seemingly be able to turn anything into a projectile (including deflected enemy attacks) by whacking it with your smacking stick. \nYou'll play as a nomad named Iris who returns home only to find that the place where you grew up has been converted into a labyrinth that hosts a reality show. The labyrinth is home to randomized biomes that feature monsters and allies alike. Rogue Labyrinth is coming to Steam on September 1. A demo, which I might just check out this weekend, is available now.\n\nAtari revealed this week that Adventure of Samsara — a spiritual successor to Atari 2600 title Adventure from 1980 — is set to arrive on September 4. It's coming to PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, Steam and GOG.\nIn this pixel art Metroidvania from developer Ilex Games, you'll attempt to restore balance to the multiverse. To do that, you'll need to explore a series of connected biomes and take down tough bosses. Of course, you'll gain abilities and upgrades while you're on your journey, because that's how Metroidvanias work.\n\nI think my favorite thing about Autumn with the Shiba Inu is that it's a sequel to a battle royale mystery visual novel called A Summer with the Shiba Inu, so I have two of these games to check out. This is a mystery visual novel from Quill Game Studios that puts you in the paws of Quei-Li, a freelance hacker tasked with uncovering information in a corruption case.\nThere are multiple endings here, which should encourage replayability, and I appreciate the lovely doggo illustrations by artist Alicia García Ochoa in the trailer. Autumn with the Shiba Inu is coming to Steam on August 14, and a trailer is available now.\n\nDude, Where Is My Beer? A New Hop is a point-and-click adventure in the vein of those LucasArts games from the '80s and '90s. In this project from Arik Games and Edo Brenes, you play as a dude who just wants to drink a pilsner when all that can be found are craft beers and gross IPAs (I can't stand IPAs, sorry). Since a master brewer has banned pilsners, you'll have to make your own by acquiring the right ingredients and gear, then entering a brewing contest.\nThis is a sequel to 2020's Dude, Where Is My Beer? and I love the Star Wars pun in the sequel's title. There's no release window for Dude, Where Is My Beer? A New Hop as yet, but there's a demo up on Steam now.\n\nLet's wrap things up for this week with a game that's \"inspired by analog horror, outsider art and the liminal landscapes of David Lynch and Andrei Tarkovsky.\" Concierge is a surrealist, non-linear game in which you'll use a camcorder to help uncover clues and solve puzzles and trials that might require some outside-the-box thinking. This project from two-person Brazilian duo Kodino Artes and publisher Digital Tribe Games looks pretty compelling to me. Concierge is coming to Steam on September 15.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/a-magical-farming-sim-cat-museum-exploration-and-other-new-indie-games-worth-checking-out-120042340.html?src=rss",
    "full_text": "The showcase also revealed that Neverway, a creepy life-sim RPG from a studio founded by Pedro Medeiros (the pixel artist of Celeste) and Murder Engine creator Isadora Sophia, is coming to Switch and Steam in 2026. Meanwhile, sci-fi RPG Caves of Qud is coming to Switch as a console exclusive later this year. This is a turn-based, sci-fi roguelike RPG from Freehold Games and publisher Kitfox Games that's rated overwhelmingly positive on Steam after nearly 10,000 player reviews (a quick scan indicates that those who get into Caves of Qud can sink hundreds of hours into it). Studios who take part can receive assistance from industry veterans, access to workshops and more.

    "summary": "Nintendo has eyed adding a Playdate-style crank to the Switch 2, according to a recently spotted patent from Nintendo Patents Watch. The hypothetical accessory would add tracking rotational movement to an existing bag of Joy-Con 2 controller tricks that includes motion and mouse controls.  \nBased on the patent application, the crank accessory attaches to the side of a Joy-Con 2 magnetically, not unlike the controllers' wrist straps. Whichever game supports the accessory can use the Joy-Con 2's mouse sensor to track the rotations of the crank as an input. Fishing games or games with dedicated fishing mini-games, like Animal Crossing: New Horizons, seem like the obvious contenders for an accessory like this, but knowing Nintendo there are weirder possibilities, too. \nNintendo\nAnother patent imagines a similar setup being used for a clickable wheel. The patent illustrations looks like a lighter, but the accessory could just as easily be used while dragging a Joy-Con 2 along a surface. It might even add extra resistance or friction to the Switch 2's mouse controls.\nGiven that these are patent applications, there's no guarantee Nintendo plans on turning either of them into real products. Still, they're a glimpse at the Switch 2's untapped potential for supporting goofy accessories, something that defined a good portion of the Wii's lifespan. \nThe wildest Nintendo got with the original Switch was Nintendo Labo, cardboard accessories that turned the console into everything from a VR headset to a simple fishing rod. A crank might be the first of several adventurous accessories for Nintendo's new console.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/nintendo-designed-a-playdate-like-crank-for-the-switch-2-211420947.html?src=rss",

We'll update this article if we hear back.\nReports that Steam would eventually be available on ChromeOS started as far back as 2020. The joint effort to port the launcher to Chromebooks was a surprise announcement at GDC 2022. Google released a Steam alpha that March, which ultimately worked better than expected. A beta version of the app came a few months later in November, adding support for several new Chromebooks. The app has existed in beta since then, without any major updates from Google or Valve.\nOne reason Google could be giving up is that the number of games that can actually run on Chromebooks is limited, thanks to the underpowered CPUs and integrated graphics that most ChromeOS devices use.

    "summary": "No product launch excites me more than the release of a new Tamagotchi. So when it comes time to review one, I like to first give myself a little while to just live with the device — to feel that initial delight and let it die down before I try to look at it critically. That way, I can more fairly assess whether we've actually got a toy that's worth the price tag and will hold a person's attention once the novelty wears off. \nBut Tamagotchi Paradise arrived a few days ago, and while a proper review will be coming down the line, there's one thing we need to address right off the bat: This thing's fucking huge.  \nIt is slightly larger overall than the previous reigning beast of the Tamagotchi family, the Tamagotchi Pix (but a hair thinner). Tamagotchi Paradise is so big, it makes me want to resurrect out-of-fashion internet terms to describe it: absolute unit; \"oh lawd, he comin'\"; etc., etc. Leading up to the device's release, there were a lot of questions about how big it really is, so for anyone who hasn't yet had a chance to get their hands on one, here you go, I'm going to do my best to illustrate it for you.\nHere's how Tamagotchi Paradise compares in size to:\nNow, don't get me wrong, Tamagotchi Paradise's comically large build isn't necessarily a bad thing. Actually, I'm kind of into it. It's certainly harder to juggle this device with anything else I might be holding, like my phone or a drink, but it does have a nice heft to it and it feels pretty good in the hand. And thanks to its sheer bulkiness, I'm probably less likely to misplace it around the house, as I've been known to do with smaller models that easily slip between couch cushions. \nWill I be running two of these at the same time? Probably not, beyond the brief moments when I want to use the Connection features. My bag only has so much room. But is Tamagotchi Paradise so cumbersome that I won't be bringing one everywhere with me for the foreseeable future? I think we all know the answer to that. \n \nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/heres-the-absolutely-massive-tamagotchi-paradise-next-to-other-objects-in-the-wild-for-scale-172017149.html?src=rss",
