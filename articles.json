    "full_text": "Valve has started to comply with the UK’s Online Safety Act, by rolling out a requirement for all Brits to verify their age with a credit card to access “mature content” pages and games on Steam. UK users won’t even be able to access the community hubs of mature content games unless a valid credit card is stored on a Steam account. “Among all age assurance mechanisms reviewed by Valve, this process preserves the maximum degree of user privacy,” says Valve in a support article. “Having the credit card stored as a payment method acts as an additional deterrent against circumventing age verification by sharing a single Steam user account among multiple persons.” In the UK you need to be 18 years of age to obtain a credit card, so this passes the age checks onto banks instead of Valve having to perform them. If you don’t have a credit card then you won’t be able to access mature content games or pages on Steam, as there’s no other way of verifying your age. Valve’s decision to require a credit card comes weeks after the UK’s new age-gating rules have been found to be easy to bypass, especially with VPNs. Discord and Reddit’s UK age verification could be briefly defeated by Death Stranding’s photo mode, but the face scanning tools have since been updated to block this bypass method. Microsoft has also started rolling out Xbox age verification in the UK. While the age verification checks are optional right now, they will become a requirement to access a variety of Xbox services in early 2026, when additional parts of the UK’s Online Safety Act come into force."

AirTags are among the latter; you can pick up a four-pack of the Bluetooth trackers for only $70 right now. That's only about $5 more than the pack's record-low price, and it's one of the best prices we've seen all year.\nFor Apple users, AirTags offer some large advantages over rival trackers. The ultra-wideband functionality offers precise tracking with iPhones less than five years old, so you can narrow your search between a couch and love seat in the same room. Over larger distances, the AirTag network enabled by all Apple device users lets you track down an object you might have misplaced in a café. \n \nIt offers a simple coin-sized design and seamless experience thanks to the Find My app. You can also force an AirTag to emit a chime to help you home in an object's location, and and that sound is nice and loud to better help you locate it.\nIt does lack a built-in keyring like rival trackers, so you'll need to pay an extra for that. And it works best with Apple devices, so Android users may want to look at trackers from Chipolo or Pebblebee that use Google's Find My Device network.

I've been working on losing weight the last year, and increasing my exercise. With Supernatural's heart rate tracking support via a phone app that connects to devices like Apple Watch, it lets me keep an eye on intensity. Mixed reality modes can work functionally to keep me aware of my environment more safely. I have bigger issues with how slowly software and services are evolving, though. Meta hasn't made any headway with folding in more organic support for watches or fitness apps, either. If Meta doesn't move fast here, it could find itself lapped by the competition. Apple's likely waiting for more affordable and lighter-weight headsets before making that move, but I'd be absolutely shocked if it didn't happen. The Quest 3 and 3S design is compact, but it's still not ideally constructed for fitness. And whatever company can ace that experience will have a killer pitch to the people who already spend hundreds or even thousands on fitness equipment and gyms, who might find it a lot more justifiable to spend up than would-be VR gamers or movie watchers."

Over 3,500 employees at Microsoft are now in CWA unions, including more than 500 World of Warcraft developers who formed Blizzard’s first wall-to-wall union last year. Microsoft laid off as many as 9,100 employees earlier this year, and 1,900 employees at Activision Blizzard and Xbox in 2024. “With every subsequent round of mass layoffs, I’ve witnessed the dread in my coworkers grow stronger because it feels like no amount of hard work is enough to protect us,” said Kelly Yeo, an organizing committee member for the Diablo union. “This is just the first step for us joining a movement spreading across an industry that is tired of living in fear.”"

On this week’s Vergecast, we’re talking through the Pixel 10 Pro’s AI features, including diving deep into the AI-infused Pro Res Zoom feature that’s built into the camera app now. I’m fascinated by how accurate and un-AI-like it seems to be, up until the point where it sees some text and becomes a jumbled mess. Dish has officially failed at becoming the United States’ fourth major phone carrier (with an assist from FCC chairman Brendan Carr). Intel is now partially owned by the United States in a questionable scheme to bully the tech industry into supporting its foundry business. And Elon Musk is actually suing Apple over the App Store, with a lawsuit that simultaneously boasts about the popularity of Grok’s App Store downloads and complains that it isn’t doing well enough. Finally, it’s time for the Thunder Round. We discuss KPop Demon Hunters’ success at Netflix, YouTube’s messy new “AI” experiment, Google’s new Android verification requirement for developers, Taco Bell’s AI drive-through fiasco, and what can only be described as an Amazon locker on wheels.

    "summary": "It's no secret that Apple devices tend to be in particularly high demand. Unfortunately, that demand can make finding big discounts on Apple gadgets a bit harder than usual. But make no mistake: Good Apple deals are usually out there. To make them a bit easier to find, we're keeping a running list of the best Apple deals on AirPods, MacBooks, iPads and more that you can shop right now. \nJust note that you’ll almost always find the best Apple deals from retailers like Amazon, Best Buy, Walmart, Target and the like, not from Apple's own online store. Unless you shop refurbished, you’ll always pay top dollar buying direct (though for some items like iPhones, that might be the best route to take). \nBest iPad deals\n \nApple iPad Air 13-inch (M3) for $649 ($150 off): Engadget's Nate Ingraham gave the 13-inch iPad Air a score of 89 when it was released in March. It has a bigger and slightly brighter display than its 11-inch counterpart; otherwise, the two slates are the same. If you plan to keep your iPad hooked up to a keyboard, the extra screen space is lovely for taking in movies and multitasking for work. This is another new low, and it applies to various color options and storage configs.\nApple iPad mini (A17 Pro) for $399 ($100 off): The iPad mini is exactly what it sounds like: the smaller iPad. This latest iteration has an improved A17 Pro chip — which is enough to support Apple Intelligence — along with 128GB of storage in the base model and Apple Pencil Pro support. As before, you’d buy it if you value the smaller 8.3-inch display and want a tablet you can more easily hold with one hand. This deal is $20 more than the lowest price we've tracked. Also at Target and Best Buy.\nApple iPad Pro 11-inch (M4) for $895 ($105 off): The iPad Pro is much more tablet than most people need, but it’s the ultimate iPad for those who can stomach its price tag. It’s wonderfully thin, its OLED display is one of the best we’ve seen on a consumer device and its M4 chip can handle virtually anything you’d ever do on an iPad. It’s also the only Apple tablet with Face ID, plus it has a better speaker setup than the iPad Air. We gave it a score of 84 in our review, with the only real drawback being its price. Also at BJ's for $45 less, if you have a membership there.\nApple iPad Pro 13-inch (M4) for $1,099 ($200 off): The 13-inch iPad Pro has all the same specs as the 11-inch model, only it's bigger and more expensive. Again, it may be worth the extra cost if you plan to multitask regularly or just want more display area for enjoying movies. Also at Target and Best Buy.\nBest AirPods deals\n \nBest Mac deals\n \nApple MacBook Air (15-inch, M4) for $999 ($200 off): The 15-inch MacBook Air is nearly identical to the smaller version but features more robust speakers and a more spacious trackpad alongside its roomier display. $999 is the lowest price we've tracked.\nApple MacBook Pro (14-inch, M4 Pro) for $1,699 ($300 off): The MacBook Pro goes beyond most people’s needs, but it remains a powerhouse for coders, media editors or anyone else with especially demanding workloads. We gave it a score of 92 last November. Just keep in mind that it’s heavier than the MacBook Air and that it still lacks a standard USB-A port. Also at Best Buy.\nApple iMac (24-inch, M4) for $1,149 ($150 off): For an all-in-one solution, the M4 iMac is a good pick thanks to its powerful performance, standard 16GB of RAM and improved webcam. Just note that it only comes in the 24-inch screen size option. We've seen this deal in the past, and it’s not quite an all-time low, but it's a decent savings compared to buying from Apple directly.\nBest Apple Watch deals\n \nApple Watch SE (GPS, 40mm) for $169 ($80 off): As with the more premium models, we wouldn’t be surprised to see an update to Apple’s budget smartwatch sometime soon (and we have a few suggestions on the matter). But thanks to discounts like this, the Apple Watch SE has turned out to be the most affordable way to get an iPhone companion for your wrist. Despite a lackluster screen and limited extra features, it handles the basics well. Also at Walmart.\nBest Apple accessories deals\n \nApple Pencil Pro for $99 ($30 off): The highest-end option in Apple’s confusing stylus lineup, the Pencil Pro supports pressure sensitivity, wireless charging, tilt detection, haptic feedback and support for Apple’s double tap and squeeze gestures, among other perks. It’s a lovely tool for more intricate sketching and note-taking, but the catch is that it’s only compatible with the M4 iPad Pro, M2 and M3 iPad Air and most recent iPad mini. We've seen this deal fairly often over the course of the year, but it's a decent discount compared to buying from Apple directly. Also at Walmart, Best Buy and Target.\nApple Pencil (USB-C) for $69 ($10 off): This more affordable Apple Pencil doesn’t support pressure sensitivity, but it still makes for a useful stylus for the basics. If you’re a casual note-taker and can live without wireless charging, you’ll save a few bucks by picking this one up. Also at Walmart, Best Buy and Target.\nRead more Apple coverage:\n\nThe best AirPods\nThe best Apple Watches\nThe best MacBooks\nThe best iPhones\nThe best iPads\n\nFollow @EngadgetDeals on X for the latest tech deals and buying advice.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/best-apple-deals-150020110.html?src=rss",
    "full_text": "It's no secret that Apple devices tend to be in particularly high demand. Unfortunately, that demand can make finding big discounts on Apple gadgets a bit harder than usual. Apple iPad Air 13-inch (M3) for $649 ($150 off): Engadget's Nate Ingraham gave the 13-inch iPad Air a score of 89 when it was released in March. We gave it a score of 84 in our review, with the only real drawback being its price. Also at BJ's for $45 less, if you have a membership there. Again, it may be worth the extra cost if you plan to multitask regularly or just want more display area for enjoying movies. Apple MacBook Air (15-inch, M4) for $999 ($200 off): The 15-inch MacBook Air is nearly identical to the smaller version but features more robust speakers and a more spacious trackpad alongside its roomier display. While the Series 10 is an iterative update, that’s not necessarily a bad thing. It still tracks workouts accurately and delivers alerts to your wrist efficiently, though we will almost certainly see a new Series 11 model by the end of the year if you're not in any rush. Despite a lackluster screen and limited extra features, it handles the basics well."

    "summary": "Finding the best wireless earbuds can make a huge difference in how you experience music, podcasts, calls and even daily commutes. Whether you're tuning out distractions on the train or taking work calls on the go, today’s wireless earbuds pack impressive audio quality and convenience into tiny, pocket-friendly forms. Many now offer excellent noise cancellation, smart ambient noise modes for staying aware of your surroundings and reliable noise isolation to help keep you focused — all without the hassle of wires.There’s a wide range of options available, from budget-friendly picks to premium models with advanced features like multi-device pairing, wireless charging cases and multiple mics for crystal-clear calls. No matter your price point, there’s a pair out there that can deliver great sound, comfort and functionality to match your needs.\nTable of contents\n\nBest wireless earbuds of 2025\nWhat to look for in the best wireless earbuds\nHow we test wireless earbuds \nOther wireless earbuds we tested\nWireless earbuds FAQs\n\nBest wireless earbuds of 2025\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhat to look for in the best wireless earbuds\nWhen it comes to shopping for earphones, the first thing to consider is design or wear style. Do you prefer a semi-open fit like AirPods or do you want something that completely closes off your ears? If you’re shopping for earbuds with active noise cancellation, you'll want the latter, but a case can be made for the former if you want to wear them all day or frequent places where you need to be tuned in to the ambient sounds. The overall shape of earbuds can determine whether you get a comfortable fit, so can the size and weight, so you’ll want to consider all that before deciding. And remember: audio companies aren’t perfect, so despite lots of research, the earbud shape they decided on may not fit you well. Don’t be afraid to return ill-fitting earbuds for something that’s more comfortable. \nAs wireless earbuds have become the norm, they’re now more reliable for basic things like consistent Bluetooth connectivity. Companies are still in a race to pack as much as they can into increasingly smaller designs. This typically means a longer list of features on the more premium sets of earbuds with basic functionality on the cheapest models. Carefully consider what you can’t live without when selecting your next earbuds, and make sure key items like automatic pausing and multipoint connectivity are on the spec sheet. You’ll also want to investigate the volume and touch controls as you’ll often have to sacrifice access to something else to make that adjustment via on-board taps or swipes. Some earbuds even offer app settings to tweak the audio profiles or firmware updates to improve performance over time.\nFor those in the Apple ecosystem, features like auto-pairing with devices, especially with AirPods Pro 2, can be an added advantage, while Android users may want to look for models that offer similar cross-device functionality.\nWhen it comes to battery life, the average set of earbuds lasts about five hours on a single charge. You can find sets that last longer, but this is likely enough to get you through a work day if you’re docking the buds during lunch or the occasional meeting. You’ll want to check on how many extra charges are available via the case and if it supports wireless charging.\nCompanies will also make lofty claims about call quality on wireless earbuds. Despite lots of promises, the reality is most earbuds still leave you sounding like you’re on speakerphone. There are some sets that deliver, but don’t get your hopes up unless reviews confirm the claims.\nSound can be subjective, so we recommend trying before you buy if at all possible. This is especially true if you're an audiophile. We understand this isn’t easy when most of us do a lot of shopping online, but trying on a set of earbuds and listening to them for a few minutes can save you from an expensive case of buyer's remorse. If a store doesn’t allow a quick demo, most retailers have return policies that will let you take earbuds back you don’t like. Of course, you have to be willing to temporarily part with funds in order to do this.\nWe also recommend paying attention to things like Spatial Audio, Dolby Atmos, 360 Reality Audio and other immersive formats. Not all earbuds support them, so you’ll want to make sure a perspective pair does if that sort of thing excites you, especially if you plan to use them for playback of high-quality audio.\nHow we test wireless earbuds\nThe primary way we test earbuds is to wear them as much as possible. We prefer to do this over a one- to two-week period, but sometimes embargoes don’t allow it. During this time, we listen to a mix of music and podcasts, while also using the earbuds to take both voice and video calls. Since battery life for earbuds is typically less than a full day, we drain the battery with looping music and the volume set at a comfortable level (usually around 75 percent).\nTo judge audio quality, we listen to a range of genres, noting any differences in the sound profile across the styles. We also test at both low and high volumes to check for consistency in the tuning. To assess call quality, we’ll record audio samples with the earbuds’ microphones as well as have third parties call us.\nWhen it comes to features, we do a thorough review of companion apps, testing each feature as we work through the software. Any holdovers from previous models are double checked for improvements or regression. If the earbuds we’re testing are an updated version of a previous model, we’ll spend time getting reacquainted with the older buds. Ditto for the closest competition for each new set of earbuds that we review.\nOther wireless Bluetooth earbuds we tested\nSony WF-C710N\nThe WF-C710N is a set of compact and comfy earbuds that offer several of Sony’s best features. While the ANC performance is above average for this price ($120), sound quality isn’t as good as the company’s slightly more expensive options. Battery life fell below stated figures and call performance isn’t good enough to use these buds for work.\nBeats Powerbeats Pro 2\nThe newest version of the Powerbeats Pro have an improved, comfortable design, balanced bass and new H2 chips and a heart rate sensor inside. But heart rate support is currently limited on iOS, and there's a possibility those capabilities make it onto the next AirPods Pro models.\nSamsung Galaxy Buds 3\nThe Galaxy Buds 3 combine ANC with an open-type design, which renders the noise-blocking abilities of the earbuds mostly useless. Still, there’s great low-end tone with ample bass when a track demands it. There are also lots of handy features, most of which require a Samsung phone. But at this price, there are better options from Google, Beats and Sony\nSennheiser Momentum Sport\nI really like the overall shape of the Momentum Sport earbuds. They’re more comfortable than the Momentum True Wireless 4 and fit in my ears better. What’s more, the body temperature and heart rate sensors work well, sending those stats to a variety of apps. However, that sport-tracking feature works best with Polar’s app and devices, so there’s that consideration. Also, the audio quality and ANC performance isn’t as good as the MTW4, and these earbuds are pricey.\nBeats Solo Buds\nThere’s a lot to like about the Solo Buds for $80. For me, the primary perk is they’re very comfortable to wear for long periods of time thanks to some thoughtful design considerations. You only get the basics here in terms of features and, as expected, the overall sound quality isn’t as good as the pricier models in the Beats lineup. You will get 18 hours of battery life though, since the company nixed the battery in the case and beefed up the listening time in the buds themselves.\nBose Ultra Open Earbuds\nBose created something very unique for this set of earbuds that allows you to stay in-tune with the world while listening to audio content. The clip-on design is very comfortable, but sound quality suffers due to the open-type fit, especially when it comes to bass and spatial audio.\nAudio-Technica ATH-TWX7\nThese stick buds have a compact design that’s comfortable to wear and the warm sound profile is great at times. However, overall audio performance is inconsistent and there’s no automatic pausing.\nMaster & Dynamic MW09\nRetooled audio, better ambient sound mode and reliable multipoint Bluetooth are the best things the MW09 has to offer. They’re expensive though, and you can find better ANC performance elsewhere.\nWireless earbud FAQs\nWhat is considered good battery life for true wireless earbuds?\nMost wireless earbuds will last five hours on a single charge, at the least. You can find some pairs that have even better battery life, lasting between six and eight hours before they need more juice. All of the best wireless earbuds come with a charging case, which will provide additional hours of battery life — but you'll have to return each bud to the case in order to charge them up.\nIs sound quality better on headphones or earbuds?\nComparing sound quality on earbuds and headphones is a bit like comparing apples and oranges. There are a lot of variables to consider and the differences in components make a direct comparison difficult. Personally, I prefer the audio quality from over-ear headphones, but I can tell you the sound from earbuds like Sennheiser’s Momentum True Wireless 3 is also outstanding.\nWhich wireless earbuds have the longest battery life?\nWith new models coming out all the time, tracking the hours of battery life for each this can be difficult to keep tabs on. The longest-lasting earbuds we’ve reviewed are Audio-Technica’s ATH-CKS5TW. The company states they last 15 hours, but the app was still showing 40 percent at that mark during our tests. The only downside is these earbuds debuted in 2019 and both technology and features have improved since. In terms of current models, Master & Dynamic’s MW08 offers 12 hours of use on a charge with ANC off (10 with ANC on) and JBL has multiple options with 10-hour batteries.\nWhat wireless earbuds are waterproof?\nThere are plenty of options these days when it comes to increased water resistance. To determine the level of protection, you’ll want to look for an IP (ingress protection) rating. The first number indicates intrusion protection from things like dust. The second number is the level of moisture protection and you’ll want to make sure that figure is 7 or higher. At this water-resistance rating, earbuds can withstand full immersion for up to 30 minutes in depths up to one meter (3.28 feet). If either of the IP numbers is an X, that means it doesn’t have any special protection. For example, a pair of wireless earbuds that are IPX7 wouldn’t be built to avoid dust intrusion, but they would be ok if you dropped them in shallow water.\nWhich earbuds stay in ears the best?\nA secure fit can vary wildly from person to person. All of our ears are different, so audio companies are designing their products to fit the most people they can with a single shape. This is why AirPods will easily fall out for some but stay put for others. Design touches like wing tips or fins typically come on fitness models and those elements can help keep things in place. You’ll likely just have to try earbuds on, and if they don’t fit well return them.\nWhat wireless earbuds work with PS5?\nPlayStation 5 doesn’t support Bluetooth audio without an adapter or dongle. Even Sony’s own gaming headsets come with a transmitter that connects to the console. There are universal options that allow you to use any headphones, headset or earbuds with a PS5. Once you have one, plug it into a USB port on the console and pair your earbuds with it.\nRecent updates\nMay 2025: Updated to ensure top picks and buying advice remain accurate.\nMarch 2025: Updated the top pick for the best sounding wireless earbuds - runner up.\nJanuary 2025: Updated the top pick for best sounding wireless earbuds.\nJuly 2024: Updated our list to include the Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/best-wireless-earbuds-120058222.html?src=rss",
    "full_text": "Sony still manages to pack in more features than anyone else too, including trademark ones like adaptive sound and Speak-to-Chat. You’ll also enjoy well over eight hours of battery life with ANC on and an IPX4 rating that will be good enough for workouts. What’s more, handy Speak-to-Chat is here and Adaptive Sound Control can automatically change settings based on activity or location. As wireless earbuds have become the norm, they’re now more reliable for basic things like consistent Bluetooth connectivity. You’ll want to check on how many extra charges are available via the case and if it supports wireless charging. But heart rate support is currently limited on iOS, and there's a possibility those capabilities make it onto the next AirPods Pro models.

    "summary": "A virtual private network (VPN) can save you a lot of money if you use it right. By changing your virtual location, you can use one streaming service to see shows that might be scattered between three or four in your home country. You can also trawl the world for discounts that only show up in a few select regions. And of course, you can't put a price on the joy of taking back your online business from intrusive ads and trackers.\nVPN providers are all competing to boost their subscriber counts, so they frequently offer massive discounts to anyone willing to sign up for one or two years at a time. Most of the deals below fit into that category. Before you jump into the list, make sure you're OK with a longer-term commitment. \nBest VPN deals\n \nNordVPN — $83.43 for a two-year subscription with three months free (77 percent off): NordVPN gets the most important parts of a VPN right. It's fast, it doesn't leak any of your data and it's great at changing your virtual location. I noted in my NordVPN review that it always connects quickly and includes a support page that makes it easy to get live help. Although I'm sad to see it shutting down Meshnet, NordVPN still includes a lot of cool features, like servers that instantly connect you to Tor. This deal gives you 77 percent off the two-year plan, which also comes with three extra months — but there's no expiration date, so you have a little time for comparison shopping.\nExpressVPN — $85.42 for a two-year subscription with four months free (61 percent off): This is one of the best VPNs, especially for new users, who will find its apps and website headache-free on all platforms. In tests for my ExpressVPN review, it dropped my download speeds by less than 7 percent and successfully changed my virtual location 14 out of 15 times. In short, it's an all-around excellent service that only suffers from being a little overpriced — which is why I'm so excited whenever I find it offering a decent deal. This deal, which gets you 28 months of ExpressVPN service, represents a 61 percent savings. It's the lowest I've seen ExpressVPN go in some time, though like NordVPN, it's not on a ticking clock.\nSurfshark Starter — $53.73 for a two-year subscription with three months free (87 percent off): This is the \"basic\" level of Surfshark, but it includes the entire VPN; everything on Surfshark One is an extra perk. With this subscription, you'll get some of the most envelope-pushing features in the VPN world right now. Surfshark has a more closely connected server network than most VPNs, so it can rotate your IP constantly to help you evade detection — it even lets you choose your own entry and exit nodes for a double-hop connection. That all comes with a near-invisible impact on download speeds. With this year-round deal, you can save 87 percent on 27 months of Surfshark.\nSurfshark One — $61.83 for a two-year subscription with three months free (87 percent off): A VPN is great, but it's not enough to protect your data all on its own. Surfshark One adds several apps that boost your security beyond just VPN service, including Surfshark Antivirus (scans devices and downloads for malware), Surfshark Alert (alerts you whenever your sensitive information shows up in a data breach) and Surfshark Search (a private search engine with no ads or activity tracking). This evergreen deal gives you 87 percent off all those features. If you bump up to Surfshark One+, you'll also get data removal through Incogni, but the price jumps enough that it's not quite worthwhile in my eyes.\nCyberGhost — $56.94 for a two-year subscription with two months free (83 percent off): CyberGhost has some of the best automation you'll see on any VPN. With its Smart Rules system, you can determine how its apps respond to different types of Wi-Fi networks, with exceptions for specific networks you know by name. Typically, you can set it to auto-connect, disconnect or send you a message asking what to do. CyberGhost's other best feature is its streaming servers — while it's not totally clear what it does to optimize them, I've found both better video quality and more consistent unblocking when I use them on streaming sites. Currently, you can get 26 months of CyberGhost for 83 percent off the usual price.\nPrivate Internet Access — $79 for a three-year subscription with three months free (83 percent off): It's a bit hard to find (the link at the start of this paragraph includes the coupon), but Private Internet Access (PIA) is giving out the best available price right now on a VPN I'd recommend using. With this deal, you can get 39 months of PIA for a little bit over $2 per month — an 83 percent discount on its monthly price. Despite being so cheap, PIA almost never comes off as a budget VPN, coming with its own DNS servers, a built-in ad blocker and automation powers to rival CyberGhost. However, internet speeds can fluctuate while you're connected.\nWhat makes a good VPN deal\nLike I said in the intro, practically every VPN heavily discounts its long-term subscriptions the whole year round. The only noteworthy exception is Mullvad, the Costco hot dog of VPNs (that's a compliment, to be clear). When there's constantly a huge discount going on, it can be hard to tell when you're actually getting a good deal. The best way to squeeze out more savings is to look for seasonal deals, student discounts or exclusive sales like Proton VPN's coupon for Engadget readers.\nOne trick VPNs often use is to add extra months onto an introductory deal, pushing the average monthly price even lower. When it comes time to renew, you usually can't get these extra months again. You often can't even renew for the same basic period of time — for example, you may only be able to renew a two-year subscription for one year. If you're planning to hold onto a VPN indefinitely, check the fine print to see how much it will cost per month after the first renewal, and ensure that fits into your budget.\nFollow @EngadgetDeals on X for the latest tech deals and buying advice.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/best-vpn-deals-120056041.html?src=rss",
    "full_text": "You can also trawl the world for discounts that only show up in a few select regions. For those who need a VPN to stay anonymous, Proton VPN is the only service implementing full-disk encryption, which means it can manage all your traffic without any of it being visible to Proton itself. ExpressVPN — $85.42 for a two-year subscription with four months free (61 percent off): This is one of the best VPNs, especially for new users, who will find its apps and website headache-free on all platforms. Surfshark has a more closely connected server network than most VPNs, so it can rotate your IP constantly to help you evade detection — it even lets you choose your own entry and exit nodes for a double-hop connection.

    "summary": "Windows offers several built-in ways to take screenshots. Sure, you can just hit the Prt Scrn button on your keyboard to capture your entire screen, but if you want to screenshot a portion of your screen, a particular window, or you have multiple monitors there are other ways you can use Windows to achieve this. Whether you're using Windows 11 or a recent update to Windows 10, the tools remain largely consistent and reliable. \nThis guide walks you through the most useful native screenshot methods, including the Snipping Tool, keyboard shortcuts and clipboard techniques, as well as popular third-party apps for more advanced needs. For more cross-platform tips, you can also check out Engadget's guide on how to take a screenshot on any device.\nHow to use the Snipping Tool for easy screenshots\nThe Snipping Tool is the most versatile built-in screenshot option in Windows. It lets you capture specific regions, open windows or the entire screen and includes basic annotation tools. It’s available by default on Windows 11 devices, though Windows 10 users can still access the Snipping Tool, despite it being replaced by Snip & Sketch.\n\nPress Windows + Shift + S to open the Snipping Tool overlay. The screen will dim slightly and a small toolbar will appear at the top.\nChoose one of the four capture modes:\n\n\nRectangular Snip: Click and drag to select a custom rectangle.\nFreeform Snip: Draw any shape around the area you want to capture.\nWindow Snip: Click on any open window to capture it.\nFull-screen Snip: Instantly captures the entire screen.\n\n\nOnce captured, the screenshot is copied to your clipboard and a preview appears in the bottom-right corner.\nClick the preview to open the image in the Snipping Tool app, where you can annotate, save or share it.\n\nTo open the full app manually, search for the Snipping Tool from the Start menu.\nHow to use Print Screen shortcuts for quick captures\nIf you want to take a screenshot without opening an app, the Print Screen (PrtScn) key and its combinations offer the fastest method.\nWindows + Print Screen\n\nPress Windows + PrtScn to capture the entire screen and automatically save the screenshot.\nThe image is stored as a PNG file in Pictures > Screenshots.\n\nPrint Screen (alone)\n\nPress PrtScn to copy the entire screen to the clipboard. Note: depending on your PC or laptop you may need to use a keyboard combination such as Windows Key + Prt Scn. See the section on other options below, like “How to take screenshots on Surface devices and laptops”.\nPaste it into an image editor like Paint or a document using Ctrl + V.\n\nAlt + Print Screen\n\nPress Alt + PrtScn to copy only the active window to the clipboard.\nThis is useful when working with multiple windows or monitors.\n\nHow to use the Game Bar for screenshots while gaming\nThe Xbox Game Bar is a built-in overlay that allows you to capture gameplay footage and screenshots. It works in most PC games and some desktop applications.\nHow to take a screenshot with the Game Bar\n\nPress Windows + G to open the Game Bar overlay. This works outside of games. You can use it on Windows (on your desktop) to control music, take screenshots and record screen captures, among other things.\nClick the camera icon in the Capture widget, or press Windows + Alt + PrtScn to take a full-screen screenshot instantly.\nScreenshots taken with Game Bar are saved in Videos > Captures.\n\nIf the Game Bar doesn't appear, you may need to enable it by going to Settings > Gaming > Xbox Game Bar.\nSave directly to the clipboard or paste into apps\nIf you don't want to save a file immediately, copying a screenshot to the clipboard lets you paste it directly into chat apps, email clients or documents.\n\nWindows + Shift + S: Opens Snipping Tool and copies your selection to the clipboard.\nPrtScn or Alt + PrtScn: Copies either the full screen or active window.\nUse Ctrl + V to paste the image into Paint, Word, Outlook or other apps.\n\nHow to take screenshots on Surface devices and laptops\nOn some laptops and Surface tablets, the Print Screen function may be combined with other keys or replaced with dedicated shortcuts.\n\nFn + Prt Scn: Use this combo on laptops where PrtScn shares a key with other functions.\nWindows + Volume Down: On Surface devices, press these together to take a full-screen screenshot, similar to a phone or tablet.\n\nHow to use Windows Snip & Sketch (if available)\nWindows 10 users can use Snip & Sketch, the predecessor to the current Snipping Tool. It functions similarly but has a slightly different interface. On newer builds, Snip & Sketch has been merged into the modern Snipping Tool.\nHowever, it is possible for Windows 10 users to still use the original Snipping Tool by searching for “Snipping Tool” via the Start Menu, or by navigating to C:\\Windows\\System32\\SnippingTool.exe.\nTo launch it manually, search for Snip & Sketch in the Start menu, but just note that it's generally recommended to use the updated Snipping Tool for better compatibility.\nThird-party Windows screenshot tools\nFor more advanced workflows or custom capture needs, several third-party tools offer extended functionality, such as auto-saving, video capture and cloud syncing.\nShareX\nShareX is a free, open-source tool with deep customization options. It supports custom keyboard shortcuts, scheduled captures, auto-upload to cloud services, scrolling window screenshots and more. It’s best suited for power users or content creators.\nGreenshot\nGreenshot is a lightweight, beginner-friendly alternative that adds annotation tools and direct upload to services like Imgur.

    "full_text": "The iPhone lineup will forever change on Sept. 9, as Apple's big \"Awe Dropping\" iPhone 17 event might reveal an ultra-thin model, nicknamed by many as \"iPhone Air.\" Months of leaks, reports and rumors have analysts and pundits not only expecting a new, thinner iPhone in the 10 a.m. PT live-streamed presentation, but also new models of the Apple Watch Series 11 and AirPods Pro 3. For this week's episode of One More Thing, embedded above, I run through the reports for what we're expecting (along with what we're not expecting yet). Hues of cool blue and warm deep orange swirl within the logo — and it just so happens that those same blues and oranges are also rumored to be the color options for the iPhone 17 lineup. The event icon holds an interactive easter egg. When visiting Apple.com, you can use your finger or a mouse pointer to press on the Apple icon and drag to see a warmer spot move around. Could Apple be hinting at a new feature related to temperature? Or perhaps the tease just points at how hot that Apple demo room will get after the keynote, as breathless reporters swarm over the new designs of this possibly thinner iPhone. (Well, thinner if you don't count the camera bump.)

It could come in four color options, including a buzzed-about sky blue hue. Compare that with the iPhone 16 Pro, which weighs 199 grams (7.03 ounces). Apple is also reportedly bringing more design in-house to improve connectivity across all devices. According to Apple, this feature can help conserve battery by automatically adjusting your iPhone's performance based on how you're using it at that moment. We likely won't find out the phone's official name until Apple announces its new iPhone lineup. Keep in mind that an iPhone Flip or Fold has been rumored for years. But a Bloomberg report from March suggested the phone could cost about $900. We'll only be able to confirm these rumors with certainty when Apple officially releases the next iPhone."

The most notable gadget shared by reputable leaker Evan Blass shows an image of a concept laptop design with a display that rotates between landscape and portrait orientations, which Lenovo has reportedly dubbed “Project Pivo.” Lenovo has a history of making funky laptop concepts — such as the see-through ThinkBook Transparent Display Laptop and the rollable display on the ThinkBook Plus Gen 6 — but these R&D projects aren’t guaranteed to be released as consumer products. The portrait mode for Project Pivo could be a useful feature for coding and viewing the mobile versions of websites and apps, so we’ll have to see if it turns into something that you can actually buy. According to Blass, Lenovo will also be showing off the Legion Go 2, the second-gen gaming handheld announced during CES that’s expected to launch sometime this year, and a selection of tablets and Motorola phones. I’ll be checking out what Lenovo has to offer during the IFA event, so more information about these products should be available next week if they make an appearance."

These Google Pixel-style bars will house a trio of 48-megapixel camera sensors, according to analyst Ming-Chi Kuo. iPhone 17 dummy units suggest the device won’t look too different from its predecessor. Apple is expected to debut three new smartwatches during its “Awe dropping” event. That includes a new Watch Ultra 3 with a potentially larger display and support for satellite texting, allowing users to send messages when they don’t have access to Wi-Fi or cellular service. The Watch Ultra 3 is expected to come with a larger 422 x 514 display resolution. Meanwhile, the budget-friendly Apple Watch SE 3 is expected to come with a revamped design, but it may not swap its aluminium case for a less expensive plastic one like Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman previously predicted. Apple’s next-gen AirPods Pro are expected to come with a bunch of updates. There are a couple of other devices that Apple is rumored to launch this year, but they may not make an appearance at the September 9th event. That includes a second-gen Vision Pro headset with an upgraded processor — the rumor mill is divided on an M4 or M5 chip — and a new strap designed to reduce neck and head pain."

    "summary": "Europe’s biggest gameshow is a beast. Spanning the halls of Cologne Messe, and with E3 now out of the picture, Gamescom is a bigger deal than ever. The show also attracts thousands of public attendees, which gives the show a fairground twist in places. This year, Netflix dominated one of the halls with a faux One Piece ship, sports stadium, a Wednesday-themed cafe and a Stranger Things ice cream stall.\nElsewhere, while Nintendo didn’t have anything new to show, it had plenty of Switch 2 consoles to convince the not-yet-convinced — and some of them had Silksong. Microsoft, too, had a substantial presence, revealing an October 16 launch date for its Xbox Ally duo of handheld gaming PCs. No price, though.\nWhile you can find all the news and previews on our Gamescom page, we’ve also drawn together all the other games we tested during this week’s show, several of which launch in the next few weeks.\n\nMetal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater\nKonami\nWhile the man who created Metal Gear moved onto walking sims and Hollywood best friends, Konami is more than happy to beef up and remaster the hits. This time around, it’s Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater.\nI’ll admit, Snake Eater was when I fell off the Metal Gear Solid train (or nuclear mech), and it came undone by the camouflage system and the difficult-to-navigate early areas. A very tight demo, as the Gamescom crowds rushed to early demos meant I didn’t get a chance to fully test the new style control system that (thankfully) shifts crouch and action/ confirm to separate buttons and adds a degree of camera control even in third-person. But it’s these kind of quality-of-life upgrades you can expect to see.\nOf course, the graphics are a huge leap from the PS2 original (or Nintendo 3DS version I bafflingly chose to buy), but the pulpy (occasionally delightfully camp) dialogue remains in place. I look forward to getting through at least the opening scenes now that the game has launched on PlayStation 5, Windows, and Xbox Series X/S.\n\nThere Are No Ghosts at the Grand\nMicrosoft\nWhat a weird game. Not in a bad way. Things start off in the titular dilapidated Grand Hotel, with me renovating a room with PowerWash Simulator-inspired water guns, spray guns, sand blasters and vacuum. You can scan the area to get hints on what needs doing, while a naggy Scottish smartphone app will also try to help — but not really. There’s also a talking cat, apparently, called Mr. Bones the Bastard, but he wasn’t talking in this demo.\nThe early trailer teased a mystery that needs to be solved in the village, and while I didn’t get a glimpse of that, I was soon tasked with checking out some mysterious black gunk.\nThe developers even put a little more effort into the demo, with voiced lines that will likely never be heard in the retail version, teasing that the protagonist was being “onboarded” when he’s interrupted by one of the characters that populate the village around the hotel.\nSeconds later, I’m riding a scooter to the dock, with a cat enjoying the ride, fixing a boat, getting a sassy soliloquoy from the woman who convinced me to drive my boat into the sea. There are plenty more songs to come as new characters join the mystery.\nAs a reminder, the demo started with me sandblasting tatty wallpaper off period walls. I’m intrigued.While Hideo Kojima, the creator of Metal Gear, moved on to walking sims and Hollywood collaborations, Konami is more than happy to revamp and remaster its hits.

I look forward to getting through at least the opening scenes now the game has launched on PlayStation 5, Windows and Xbox Series X/S.\n\nResident Evil Requiem\n\nWe’ve got a more detailed breakdown by contributor Alessandro Fillari here, but I got a chance to get scared out of my skin too. The headline feature is the ability to play between first- and third-person perspectives. Still, it revealed an uncomfortable truth to myself: I'm a total coward and playing in third person is much less scary.\n\nOnimusha: Way of the Sword\nCapcom\nCapcom’s return to its samurai vs. demons series is satisfying and fun, especially when compared to more punishing games in the genre, like Sekiro. However, the early chapters have a pretty basic attack flow, and I'm keen to see how things evolve beyond that. At least they’ve got one thing right: a great villain to loathe.\n\nSilksong: Hollow Knight\n\nThe long-running DLC-into-sequel-into-meme-sensation is almost here, right? The demo at Gamescom remained the most popular attraction at Microsoft’s booth. Two Xbox Ally handhelds were also running the demo, which I was fortunate enough to test on. And I can say… yep, still plays like a faster, slicker Hollow Knight.\nHaving played it a heady six years ago, it’s now actually difficult to discern the differences between the early build and what is surely an almost-final snapshot of the game. One of the notable changes is its more elaborate lighting effects and details —  things Redditors have pored over as each new trailer video appeared. I stand by my hands-on impressions from 2019, even if they have a fine vintage at this point.\nBut when is it coming out? Oh, September 8. \n\nAll the announcements from Gamescom 2025\n\nCall of Duty: Black Ops 7 arrives on November 14\nXbox Ally handhelds will be available October 16, but we still don't know the price\nXbox unveils its Handheld Compatibility Program\nDouble Fine’s Keeper may have the most endearing video game double act since Banjo and Kazooie\nSony Inzone launches new peripherals in collaboration with Fnatic\nDenshattack! is a blend of Tony Hawk, trains and shonen anime\nBattlestar Galactica might finally get the video game adaption it deserves\nBlack Myth: Zhong Kui is the next title from Game Science Studio\nFromSoft's Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice is becoming an anime\nFallout season two has a teaser trailer and a December 17 release date\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/everything-we-played-at-gamescom-2025-110017871.html?src=rss",

    "full_text": "In June, Mark Zuckerberg went for the ultimate Hail Mary in the ever-intensifying AI race: He spun up a brand-new Meta AI lab after making a $14.3 billion acquisition of Scale AI — and then spending billions more hiring some of the industry’s preeminent researchers and engineers. Fast-forward a couple of months, and Zuckerberg may have recruited the talent, but now the question is whether he’ll be able to keep it from slipping through his fingers. The company has said both are natural follow-ups to its hiring processes in recent months. When a publicly-traded tech giant spends billions making new hires and wants to put all its eggs in the Superintelligence basket, it’s bound to pause and get organized — especially if it’s trying to catch up with the world’s leading labs in the ever-intensifying AI arms race. So what’s going on with the hiring freeze and restructuring? The memo goes on to state that it’s been “common practice across many orgs across Meta in the last two years and will allow leadership to thoughtfully plan our 2026 headcount growth, as we work through our strategy.” It said that Wang’s staff will meet weekly to evaluate business-critical hires “on a case by case basis.” Then there’s Meta’s Fundamental AI Research lab, or FAIR, which has been around for a while and the company has seemed to deprioritize in recent months. Wang also wrote that Meta would dissolve its “AGI Foundations” organization and move those employees into one of the teams above. In a post on X, Meta spokesperson Andy Stone wrote that the hiring freeze and restructuring were “mundane” updates because “all that’s happening is: a temporary pause on some hiring while we do planning and forecasting, which we do regularly, and a structure for our new superintelligence efforts, after we brought a number of new people on board.” Update August 29th: The article was updated to reflect more of Meta’s AI plans with specific models."

Tesla's fitted bolstered performance seats with powered thigh extenders that promise to make long drives feel like less of a compromise between comfort and support. There's a new carbon-fiber dash trim too, so you can really make it look the part. Tesla has thrown in adaptive suspension that was tuned in-house and validated at the Nürburgring. It adjusts in real time to match your driving and the road conditions. Thanks to a new high-density battery pack, it's achieved without adding weight. Put simply, this new Model Y Performance is Tesla's electric SUV turned up to 11."

As for other T-Mobile features, you'll have to look further up the plan menu. Essentials Saver and Essentials don't carry the five-year price guarantee found in the Experience plans, nor do they include T-Satellite texting access, but you can add the Starlink-based service as an optional add-on when it launches on July 23. Perks are also reserved for the costlier plans, which means no included Netflix, Apple TV Plus or Hulu streaming thrown in. The Essentials Saver plan costs $50 a month for a single line, $80 for two lines and $100 for three lines, the maximum number allowed on this plan. If you need three or more lines, the Essentials plan is a better value. Providers want to push you toward their more expensive offerings, but they also know there's a place for cost-conscious people who want just the basics. And even though the hotspot feature is especially pokey at 3G speeds, it's still there in a pinch if needed."

Its cinematic style grabbed my attention and kept me watching, even when I desperately wanted to look away. Corporal Bower (played by Ben Foster) wakes up from cryo-sleep with a troubling case of amnesia. Almost immediately, it's clear that things have not gone to plan on Elysium, the colony ship transporting 60,000 humans from an overpopulated Earth to a new world. On a ship that has devolved from its original humanitarian mission of settling a new planet, he is accosted by creatures that only vaguely resemble people, as well as humans fighting to survive. Bower finds two companions -- a member of the agriculture team who doesn't speak English but has been hunting the predatory creatures, and Nadia, an environmental scientist. Along the way, they encounter a sketchy survivor who tells them things collapsed when the bridge received bad news from Earth and was overtaken by Pandorum, a space-inflicted malaise that can cause psychosis, triggered by strong emotional states. Pandorum's vibe is perfect for anyone who loves hard science-fiction horror. Stream it for free on Tubi, and find out what the Elysium is hiding today."

    "full_text": "He’s been a tech journalist for 20 years. Dangbei is bringing its S7 Ultra Max all-in-one projector to Berlin next week for the big IFA tech show. Here’s the teaser Dangbei just sent to my inbox: When this 4K projector was announced in China back in July, Dangbei said it achieved class-leading brightness by combining 48 laser-light sources. But it claimed “5800 CVIA lumens” back then, and CVIA typically delivers a higher brightness value than the stricter ISO and ANSI standards. So there’s reason to be skeptical of the higher 6,200 ISO lumen claim. Here’s the subtitled launch from a few months ago: And like Anker’s very bright 3500 ANSI lumen Nebula X1 projector I recently reviewed, the S7 Ultra Max is liquid cooled to tame all the heat its projection tech produces while reducing the noise to a very quiet 24dB, according to the company. All this for a price of just 15,999 yuan, which converts to about $2,250. Possibly, we’ll see what Dangbei has to say next week in Berlin."

While meal kits were once a pricier alternative to buying groceries and cooking at home, stubborn grocery inflation over the last several years has challenged that. Read more: Meal Kits Have Gotten Cheap, but Are They Cheaper Than Groceries? When Blue Apron launched in 2012, the average cost per serving was $10. Because of too many subscriptions, some folks don't want to add a monthly meal kit commitment. Just last month, HelloFresh was ordered to pay $7.5 million after a California court found the meal kit giant guilty of misleading customers about its subscription model. Blue Apron now represents the only major meal kit service that doesn't require users to sign up for a subscription, although there is a subscription option for those who want it. Total sample size was 2,607 adults, of whom 2,172 had not used a meal kit delivery service."

    "full_text": "Google’s Phone app is adding “Calling Cards” that let you customize the appearance of contact screens for incoming calls. They’re similar to the Contact Poster feature that iPhone users have had since 2023, allowing Google Phone app users to replace the teeny contact photos that appear when someone is calling you with full-screen images and stylized names. The update is part of Android’s Material 3 Expressive design language overhaul, which Google used to test a revamped Phone app interface in June. Calling Cards started appearing in beta versions of Google’s Contacts and Phone apps earlier this month, but now they’re getting a public release in version v188 of the Phone app. Google says Calling Cards will be available worldwide, and are being rolled out “in phases,” so they might take a while to appear for everyone. When the feature becomes available, Phone app users will see a banner on the Home tab that reads “Introducing calling card: Customize how you see your contact when they call you.” Tapping on this takes users to the Calling Card page, but you can also navigate to it manually in Contacts. Unlike Contact Posters on iOS, you can’t design your own Calling Card that will appear for other contacts when you call them. Google’s Calling Cards only let you set customized screens that are specific to your device, so you’ll have to set these for every individual person if you want to use the feature. Those contacts can’t edit how their Calling card appears on your device, however, so you can have some fun with how you customize them. Transcripts and voicemail audio can be found in the Phone app Recents tab, and Google says that all messages are “stored privately on your device.” The feature is available on Pixel 4 phones or newer, and on Pixel Watch 2 models or newer when paired with Pixel 6 or more recent Google phone models."

The solution was a roller ball mouse and Logitech’s MX Ergo is the best I’ve found. It tilts for a more natural “handshake” grip and has a slow-mo option for more precise movements in Photoshop and other apps. You can even program the various buttons to do app-specific things using Logitech’s software. It's also a handy companion for an iPad and makes a good Mac accessory as well. My only gripe is the antiquated micro-USB charging port, but the battery lasts long enough that I only have to use it once every few months. It’s pricey at $100, so you may prefer the $70 Ergo Lift. It also offers a handshake grip, but without the roller ball, and has Bluetooth or USB dongle connectivity options. Of course, there's also Apple's own Magic Trackpad, which basically replicates the MacBook's touch surface so you can place it anywhere. If you're a fan of the multi-touch gestures on your MacBook, this could be a more comfortable way to use them."

    "summary": "For sensitive teeth or a tight budget, these are the best whitening toothpastes dentists recommend.",
    "full_text": "Some of her reasons for recommending it include its trusted brand name and its 5% hydrogen peroxide whitening agent. Unlike other whitening agents that work by removing stains on the surface of the tooth, hydrogen peroxide can get inside the tooth so it whitens intrinsically as well as extrinsically. Sachar also recommends this toothpaste, saying, \"Colgate Optic White Pro Series is the strongest professional-level whitening toothpaste on the market and would be my pick. Its 5% hydrogen peroxide content is the most effective bleaching agent in an OTC toothpaste, delivering visible results fast.\" However, she recommends patients use it with care and alternate it with a non-whitening or enamel-repairing toothpaste periodically. Who should not get it: According to Khan, one downside to this toothpaste is that it contains sodium lauryl sulfate which may cause irritation, such as canker sores. Other popular whitening toothpastes may also contain SLS, so it's important to look at the ingredients before you buy a product if you're sensitive to it. \"It may not be ideal for sensitive teeth or continuous long-term use without alternating with a non-whitening toothpaste,\" adds Sachar. \"I recommend this one for short-term use or occasional whitening boosts. I tell my patients to use it for short periods of time and alternate it with a non-whitening or enamel-repairing toothpaste periodically.\""

    "full_text": "There are often better and cheaper alternatives to Apple’s first-party accessories, but the company’s MagSafe wireless charger is worth considering if you have a new iPhone. Like all other MagSafe accessories, this charging pad uses magnets to attach to the back of the latest iPhones and it’s surprisingly strong. Not only can you safely pick up your handset and use it with the disk still attached, but the iPhone can dangle by the charger’s cord without falling off. (You still probably shouldn’t do this.) The charging plate itself is about a quarter-inch thick so it barely adds any heft to the iPhone. The magnets only attach to the latest iPhones, but it will still charge older models wirelessly, going back to the iPhone 8. I only wish the cable were longer than three feet so that you had more leeway to use your iPhone on the couch or in bed while powering it up. Apple’s MagSafe charger accessory comes in at $39 (and the latest model will cost you $50), but if you want to spend a bit less, Spigen’s $25 ArcField magnetic wireless charger is a decent dupe. It’s magnets are nowhere near as strong as those on the Apple MagSafe charger — so you definitely shouldn’t pick up your iPhone by this cable — but it’ll power up your handset and stay put while doing so."

    "summary": "\nIn just a few days, the Apple iPhone 17 event will be here — the \"awe dropping\" event is officially confirmed for Tuesday, September 9. If Apple follows its past schedule, that could mean we'll get to download iOS 26 and iPad 26 exactly one week after the event. Coming with the OS 26es are huge upgrades to your iPhone and iPad's operating systems. You've heard of Liquid Glass, right? It's like the better-executed version of Windows Vista and definitely one of the cooler features coming this fall. We spent two weeks test-driving it — you can check out our detailed hands-on iOS 26 preview, or you can try it out yourself by downloading and installing the public beta 5. That software is a more stable iteration of the separate developer version, which recently hit the beta 8 waypoint, and offers a few more flashy features not yet available in the public version. (While the public beta is open to everyone and quite stable, always remember there's a degree of risk involved with beta software.) Additionally, there are credible reports that iOS 26 could bring a new live translation feature to AirPods, too. Not sure if you want to upgrade your smartphone or tablet this year? No worries, we'll help you find out if your devices will be able to run iOS 26.\nWhile Apple didn't nix any iPhones from its eligibility list last year, that's not the case for 2025 — a few models are getting cut this time. All iPhone 8 models and the iPhone X were the last to get the boot in 2023, and this year the 2018 models are getting left behind. If you have an ineligible device, you won't be able to download iOS 26 when it becomes available this fall. \nWe'll get to the bottom of which iPhones and iPads will support iOS 26 and iPadOS 26 this year. To see what's coming with the latest OSes, check out everything announced at Apple's WWDC June 9 event. One thing you shouldn't immediately expect is Apple's updated version of Siri, though the company is reportedly working on a 'stripped-down' AI chatbot to compete with ChatGPT. \nThese three iPhones won't be compatible with iOS 26\nUnlike last year, several iPhone models won't be eligible to download the newest iOS when it makes its debut in September. This trio of models first released in 2018 won't be coming to the iOS 26 party:\n\niPhone XR\niPhone XS\niPhone XS Max\n\niPhones compatible with iOS 26\nWhile we don't yet know the new iPhones Apple will be dropping next month — though there are iPhone 17 rumors — we do know, per Apple's site, that the phones listed below will be compatible with iOS 26. Basically, if you have an iPhone that was announced in 2019 or later, you're in the clear:\n\niPhone SE (second generation or later)\niPhone 11\niPhone 11 Pro\niPhone 11 Pro Max\niPhone 12\niPhone 12 mini\niPhone 12 Pro\niPhone 12 Pro Max\niPhone 13\niPhone 13 mini\niPhone 13 Pro\niPhone 13 Pro Max\niPhone 14\niPhone 14 Plus\niPhone 14 Pro\niPhone 14 Pro Max\niPhone 15\niPhone 15 Plus\niPhone 15 Pro\niPhone 15 Pro Max\niPhone 16\niPhone 16 Plus\niPhone 16 Pro\niPhone 16 Pro Max\niPhone 16e\n\niPads compatible with iPadOS 26\nThe iPads listed below, and any iPads released later this year, are eligible to download iPadOS 26.\n\niPad Pro (M4)\niPad Pro 12.9‑inch (3rd generation and later)\niPad Pro 11‑inch (1st generation and later)\niPad Air (3rd generation and later, including M2 and M3)\niPad (8th generation and later, including A16)\niPad mini (5th generation and later, including A17 Pro)\n\nWhat if I don't want to buy a new iPhone?\nIf you want to continue using your older iPhone that isn't supported by iOS 26, that's fine. However, you'll miss out on security updates which could potentially put your phone at risk for malware and other threats. Additionally, some apps may stop working if they require a certain version of iOS or later. And of course, you won't be able to access the latest features iOS 26 offers.\nWhen will iOS 26 become available?\nApple usually rolls out its latest iOS in mid-September, just a few days before the new iPhones hit store shelves. Last year, it released iOS 18 on Monday, Sept. 16. If it follows suit this year, we should have access to the new operating system on Tuesday, Sept. 16 — exactly one week after the event.\nExpect a confirmation of the release date at the iPhone 17 event on September 9. \niOS 26 features we're excited about\nLiquid Glass design: Your home screen is getting revamped with new app icons, including dark mode and all-clear options. You'll also notice buttons with a new floating design. Liquid Glass was designed to make all of Apple's OSes more cohesive.\nPhone app redesign: You'll finally be able to scroll through contacts, recent calls and voicemail messages all on one screen. It also comes with a new feature called Hold Assist that'll notify you when an agent comes to the phone so you can avoid the elevator music.\nLive Translate: iOS 26 is bringing the ability to have a conversation via phone call or text message with someone who speaks another language. Live Translate will translate your conversation in real time. \nPolls feature: Coming to group messages in the Messages app, chat members will be able to create polls. This can help prevent the unwanted 30+ messages when it comes to deciding which restaurant you're meeting at this weekend.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/apples-new-ios-26-public-beta-5-is-here-but-is-your-iphone-eligible-for-the-update-check-this-list-191854133.html?src=rss",

The hazard is serious, according to a notice posted Thursday by the Consumer Product Safety Commission. \"The pressure washer's capacitor can overheat and burst, causing parts to be forcefully ejected, posing a risk of serious injury from impact to the user or bystanders,\" the notice said. The recalled pressure washers, model numbers RY142300 and RY142711VNM, were sold for $300 to $400 at Home Depot and Direct Tools Factory Outlet between July 2017 and June 2024. If you own one of the affected pressure washers, stop using it immediately. Visit Ryobi's recall website to verify if your model is affected. If so, you'll receive a free replacement capacitor, including shipment and installation instructions. No receipt or proof of purchase is required. The affected Ryobi models were not part of CNET's best pressure washer list, which rates pressure washers for affordability and flexibility as well as evaluates which are best for specific jobs, such as cleaning RVs."

With the Amazon-Comcast NBCUniversal agreements, the Peacock app will continue to be available on Fire TV devices, while Xfinity X1 and Xumo customers will still have access to Prime Video. Customers can also continue to rent and buy Universal Pictures Home Entertainment films through Prime Video.

    "full_text": "Microsoft has fired two more employees who participated in recent protests against the company’s contracts with the Israeli military and government. The two employees, Nisreen Jaradat and Julius Shan, were fired “in connection” with demonstrations that saw protesters set up encampments at Microsoft’s headquarters, according to Hossam Nasr, an organizer with the No Azure for Apartheid group. Two other Microsoft employees were fired last night for their involvement with a protest that saw members of the group gain access to a company building and live stream themselves inside the office of Microsoft president Brad Smith. Jaradat had previously sent a mass email around Microsoft saying she was “fed up” with the company’s treatment of her as a Palestinian worker, bypassing the company’s restrictions on language around Palestine and Gaza internally in order to do so. The group interrupted Microsoft executives during live streamed presentations on multiple occasions this spring. More recently, the group attempted to occupy a plaza on Microsoft’s headquarters. After being removed, they returned the next day with tents and tables and poured red paint across a Microsoft sign; 18 people were arrested. Protesters returned again on Tuesday for the demonstration in Smith’s office. Afterward, Smith held a press conference saying that Microsoft is “working every day” to investigate potential misuse of Azure in Israel. But he said the protesters’ actions were “not ok.”"

By contrast, employment for more experienced workers in those fields and those working in less AI-exposed fields like nursing \"has remained stable or continued to grow,\" the study said. The adjustments are more visible in employment than compensation, meaning AI might affect employment more than wages, at least for now. The patterns also hold in jobs that aren't affected by remote work and for both fields with a high share of college graduates and those without. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, overall unemployment remains relatively stable. Read more: How to Write a Cover Letter Using AI"

Translate will then surface recommended scenarios like asking for the nearest bus stop, greeting a neighbor or chatting about your hobbies. You can then choose either a listening or speaking exercise. \"These updates are made possible by advancements in AI and machine learning,\" Google Product Manager Matt Sheets said in a blog post. This comes as Google adds other language-specific features like Voice Translate on the Pixel 10 series. That feature can also translate what someone is saying in real time, but while chatting on the phone, and goes the extra mile of mimicking the sound of their voice, instead of superimposing a robotic one. And last year, Google Translate added 110 new languages thanks to AI advancements. Live translations are currently limited to users in the US, India and Mexico."

My focus is on building models that really work for the consumer companion.” Microsoft AI plans on rolling out MAI-1-preview for certain text use cases in its Copilot AI assistant, which currently relies on OpenAI’s large language models.

    "summary": "You might already have a good idea of which smartphone you want to be your next one. But there are more solid options available now than ever before, making the decision not as cut-and-dry as it used to be. While the decision is a bit easier if you know you want an iPhone, there's even enough variation between those new models that you may have to think about it longer than you anticipated. If you’re an Android person, you have even more options to choose from — including foldables — and more questions to answer before you spend any money.At Engadget, we review phones regularly and have tested dozens over the years. Whether you’ve had your eye on one of our current top picks, one of Samsung's Galaxy S25 phones, a cheap phone or another device, we’re here to help you decide which is the best phone to buy this year.\nAndroid or iOS?\nWhen you're searching for the best smartphone, it becomes clear that each OS has its pros and cons. Apple’s tight-knit ecosystem makes it super easy to share data between iPhones, iPads and Macs or seamlessly hand-off phone calls or music from one device to another. At the same time, you’re effectively locked in, as services like Apple Messages aren’t available on other platforms. \nAs for Android, there’s a much wider range of handsets from companies like Google, Samsung, Sony and more. However, Android phones don’t enjoy that same length of software support and often have lower trade-in values. In short, there’s no wrong answer. However, you will want to consider how your phone will fit in with the rest of your devices. So unless you’re really fed up with one OS and willing to learn another, it probably doesn’t make a lot of sense to switch from an iPhone to an Android phone (or vice versa) – especially if everyone else in your household is using the same platform.\nCameras\nSince your cell phone often pulls double duty as your primary camera, figuring out what kind of photo tools you want is key. Nowadays, practically every mobile phone can take a great picture in bright light. But if you want a long optical zoom, you’ll probably have to upgrade to a more expensive device.\n\n\n\n\n   Cherlynn Low / Engadget \n \n\nMid-range phones often only have two rear cameras (a primary wide-angle lens and a secondary ultra-wide camera) and can sometimes struggle in low-light situations. Each phone maker also has various features that might be a better fit for your style, with Apple offering four different color presets on the latest iPhones, while Google’s Pixel 9 Pro comes with neat tools like dedicated long exposure and Action Pan modes.\nWill you get mmWave 5G or Wi-Fi 7?\nThe good news is that in 2025, most phones have at least Wi-Fi 6 or Wi-Fi 6e and support for some kind of 5G connectivity. However, if you want the fastest wireless speeds possible, it’s going to cost you a little extra. For example, on certain networks, mmWave 5G offers up to gigabit download speeds, less latency and better bandwidth. But mmWave 5G also requires more sophisticated (and pricier) modems, which means support for it is often missing on less expensive devices.\nOn the bright side, mmWave 5G isn’t as widely available as other versions of 5G, so depending on where you live and what network you’re on, you may not be missing out on much right now if you buy a phone that doesn’t support it. It’s a similar situation for Wi-Fi 7, which is available on some high-end handsets like the Galaxy S25, but harder to find on cheaper devices. Wi-Fi 7 also requires you to have a compatible router, so unless you know you need it or have a specific use case in mind, the lack of support for mmWave 5G or Wi-Fi 7 shouldn’t be a dealbreaker when looking for a new phone.\nOther features to consider\nBecause not everyone agrees on what makes the best phone, you should think about any other specs that might be extra important for you. Mobile gamers will almost certainly appreciate the 120Hz refresh rates you get on phones like the Samsung Galaxy S25 or the Apple iPhone 16 Pro. Alternatively, if long battery life is important, you’ll probably want to go with a larger iPhone or an Android phone with a battery that’s between 4,000 and 5,000 mAh in size. Meanwhile, if you find yourself juggling a lot of devices, it can be really nice to have a phone that supports reverse wireless charging, which on Samsung phones even lets you recharge the company’s Galaxy Watches.\n \n \n \n \n \n \nOther smartphones we've tested\nOnePlus 13\nWhile the OnePlus 13 features some basic AI features like Google’s Circle to Search and Gemini assistant, it’s really just an old-fashioned flagship in all the best ways. That’s because instead of focusing on machine learning, OnePlus crammed the phone with tons of top-notch hardware. It sports a 6.8-inch OLED display with an incredible peak brightness of up to 4,500 nits. The OP13 also offers excellent performance thanks to Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 8 Elite chip, along with 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage. There are also three 50-MP rear cameras including one with a 3x telephoto zoom and a massive 6,000 mAh battery that’s bigger than what you get in practically all of its competitors.\nOnePlus didn’t skimp on the phone’s design either, as the OP13 still comes with the company’s signature Alert Slider. Plus, if you opt for the blue or white variants, you’ll get a durable and very touchable vegan leather back that helps the phone stand out among all its glass brick rivals. But the best part is that starting at $900, it costs less than an equivalent Galaxy S25+ too.\nFAQs\nHow do I know which smartphone is the best for me?\nWhile choosing the best smartphone can be challenging, it mostly comes down to how you plan on using the device. All of the best phones available now get the basics right — you’ll be able to make calls, text and access the internet without many hiccups. If your smartphone is your most used gadget, you may want to consider paying for a device on the higher end of the price spectrum. That will get you better overall performance, higher-quality cameras and a phone that will last for many years. If you don’t use your phone for everything, you may be able to compromise on performance and extra perks and spend less on a still-capable handset.\nHow much is a smartphone?\nSmartphones range in price from $300 to over $1,500. The best budget phones available now will usually compromise on overall performance, design, camera prowess and extra features to keep costs down. On the flip side, the most expensive phones will have powerful processors, triple-camera arrays and even flip or fold designs. Most people will find a phone that fits their needs somewhere in the middle of that wide price range — we’ve found that most of the best smartphones available right now cost between $500 and $1,000.\nWhat can you do on a smartphone?\nSmartphones are essentially small, portable computers that let you do things like check email, browse social media, follow map directions, make contactless payments and more. This is all on top of the basics like making phone calls and texting, which we’ve come to expect in all modern cell phones. Smartphones have also mostly replaced compact cameras thanks to their high-quality, built-in shooters, and the fact that most smartphones today as just as portable, if not more so, as compact cameras.\nHow long do smartphones last?\nSmartphones can last years and people are holding on to their phones longer now than ever before. Software updates and battery life are two of the biggest factors that can affect phone longevity. Apple promises five years worth of software updates for its latest iPhones, and Google promises the same for its Pixel phones. Samsung phones will get four years worth of Android updates from the time they launch. As for charging speeds and battery life, your phone can deteriorate over time as you use and recharge your phone on a regular basis.\nRecent updates\nAugust 2025: Updated to include the Google Pixel 10 Pro.\nJuly 2025: Updated to include the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7.\nApril 2025: Updated to include the Google Pixel 9a.\nFebruary 2025: Updated to include the iPhone 16e.\nJanuary 2025: Updated to include details about Samsung's latest Galaxy S-series phones.\nSeptember 2024: Updated to include the latest iPhone 16 models and a new midrange iPhone top pick.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/best-smartphones-140004900.html?src=rss",

But mmWave 5G also requires more sophisticated (and pricier) modems, which means support for it is often missing on less expensive devices. As we discovered in our testing for the iPhone 16 Pro review, it’ll take a bit of getting used to at first. Not only do both devices now support full high-res portrait shots, its 100x Pro Res Zoom captures long-range photos in ways that lenses and megapixels alone simply can’t. Then you add in noticeably better performance, bigger batteries, brighter displays and proper Qi2 magnetic charging (the first from a major Android phone maker) via Pixelsnap and you have truly smart devices that makes picking anything else seem kind of dumb. So while it's not super fancy, the phone has all of its most important bases covered (and then some). Sadly there’s still no dedicated telephoto lens, which makes it less useful in some shooting situations. But the best part is that starting at $900, it costs less than an equivalent Galaxy S25+ too."

    "summary": "Meta seems to be working on ways for Threads users to share long-form writing within a single post. Several users have reported seeing a new \"attach text\" feature on the service, which allows them to embed large chunks of text within a single post.\nThe feature, which hasn't been formally announced by Meta, is similar to the \"articles\" feature that's available on X to Premium+ subscribers. It enables Threads users to embed longer text excerpts within a single Threads post and offers some basic formatting options. \"Attach longer text and get creative with styling tools to share deeper thoughts, news snippets, book excerpts and more,\" Meta explains in a screenshot shared byThreads user Justin Mixon.\nThough the feature hasn't been rolled out widely yet, it appears that anyone can view these longer text snippets that have already been shared. On mobile, these attachments open into a full-screen view that makes it easy to scroll through the text. On threads.com, text appears in a dedicated window. (Here are a couple examples shared by Threads user Roberto Nickson.)\nThreads Screenshot \nIt's not clear what Meta's plans are for the feature. Engadget confirmed the company is currently testing the ability to share long-form text, but it's not clear when it might be more widely available. The ability to embed long-form writing directly on Threads could open up new possibilities for creators, publishers and others who want to move beyond the service's 500-character limit.\nEngadget's reporting has found that the vast majority of Threads users don't click on links in posts, so giving users more flexibility within Threads itself could be helpful. At the same time, it risks making the 400-million user service even more insular. It's also worth noting that screenshots currently indicate posts with text attachments aren't able to be shared to services within the fediverse, which could potentially undermine Meta's goal to be interoperable with other ActivityPub-enabled platforms like Mastodon.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/meta-is-experimenting-with-long-form-text-on-threads-175557130.html?src=rss",

It enables Threads users to embed longer text excerpts within a single Threads post and offers some basic formatting options. \"Attach longer text and get creative with styling tools to share deeper thoughts, news snippets, book excerpts and more,\" Meta explains in a screenshot shared by Threads user Justin Mixon. Though the feature hasn't been rolled out widely yet, it appears that anyone can view these longer text snippets that have already been shared. On mobile, these attachments open into a full-screen view that makes it easy to scroll through the text. On threads.com , text appears in a dedicated window. (Here are a couple examples shared by Threads user Roberto Nickson.) Engadget confirmed the company is currently testing the ability to share long-form text, but it's not clear when it might be more widely available. The ability to embed long-form writing directly on Threads could open up new possibilities for creators, publishers and others who want to move beyond the service's 500-character limit."

    "summary": "The RX1R III is an incredible camera, capable of capturing stunning photos. However, for something Sony waited nearly a decade to update and is charging $5,100 for, it also feels like a missed opportunity. First, the RX1R III is nearly $2,000 more expensive than its predecessor. Plus, it’s missing a handful of features the company really should have included for it to hold its own against other high-end compact cameras, including Fujifilm’s X100VI and GFX100RF, as well as the Leica Q3 family. I love the RX1R III, but I wish it was easier to recommend.\n \nImage quality and autofocus\n\n\n\n\n   Igor Bonifacic for Engadget \n \n\nNew to the RX1R III is a 61-megapixel full-frame sensor Sony first introduced alongside the A7R IV back in 2019. It might be an old component, but having so much resolution in a camera I could carry everywhere felt like cheating. \nWhat hasn't changed is the glass on the RX1R III. The camera still has the same fixed 35mm f/2.0 Zeiss lens that debuted on the original RX1R in 2012. With past models, autofocus was often an issue, but it turns out the Zeiss lens wasn't to blame. It was the focusing algorithms on the older cameras.\nLike the A7R V, the RX1R III comes with Sony's flagship Bionz XR image processor and a dedicated chip for AI-assisted subject detection. At first, I was skeptical of the RX1R III's autofocus capabilities since the camera doesn't come with a joystick to make it easy to set a focus point manually. As it turns out, it doesn't need one. The autofocus on the RX1R III feels magical, thanks to its subject tracking. The seven different recognition modes offered by the RX1R III cover most of the things I like to shoot — including people, pets and birds — and getting the camera to lock onto a subject was simple. All I had to do was press and hold the new \"AF-ON\" button. The camera can be configured to prioritize specific subjects, but I found that wasn't necessary to do; I could delegate focusing entirely to the camera.\nAll of that brings me back to the RX1R III's Zeiss glass. I know some people will be disappointed Sony didn't add a new lens, but I'm a fan of the decision. For me, the character of that lens has always been part of the appeal of the series, and it's my favorite aspect of the new model.\nWith Sony's 61MP sensor behind it, the Zeiss optics can capture photos with a great amount of detail without ever feeling clinical or overly sharp like with many of the company's G Master lenses. The best way I can describe the rendering is that it's Leica-like with beautiful, creamy bokeh. With the right light, the RX1R III can produce images that look almost painterly, and reviewing the photos I snapped with it, they're among some of the best I've captured in the 10 years I've been shooting.\nAt the same time, I think Sony deserves credit for greatly improving the color science of its JPEGs. The company has long offered excellent RAW support, but the older I get, the more I appreciate a camera that can produce great images with minimal editing. With the RX1R III, Sony has delivered that. The camera offers a total of 12 JPEG profiles with six custom slots. Two of the default profiles, Film 2 and Film 3, are borrowed from the FX3, and offer calming, muted tones that are a nice contrast to the more vivid colors Sony is typically known for.\nAs for video, there's not much to say. The RX1R III can capture 4K footage at 60 frames per second and 1080p clips at 120 fps. That said, as I'll get to in a moment, Sony's new model is missing some features that would have made it a competent video camera. As things stand, I think it's only suited for capturing home videos you don't plan to share with the world.\nDesign and handling\n\n\n\n\n   Igor Bonifacic for Engadget \n \n\nThe first time I looked through the RX1R III's viewfinder, I thought Sony had sent me a defective unit. The redesigned EVF is now built into the top left of the camera, but the company seems to have pulled the screen from the parts bin, as it only offers 2.36 million dots of resolution. For context, the A7R V has a 9.44-million-dot OLED EVF, while the older A7R IV has a 5.76-million-dot screen. It's jarring going from the new rear-panel LCD and viewfinder. It also feels cheap. A $5,100 camera should include a top-of-the-line EVF.\nThe viewfinder is not the only part of the RX1R III that left me confused about what Sony was thinking. There's the rear screen I just mentioned, which is both better and worse than the one before. On the one hand, it offers nearly double the resolution, thanks to its 2.36-million-dot panel. On the other hand, it's no longer articulating, which feels like a major step back since it makes shooting candid shots from the hip a lot harder. And forget about vlogging or taking selfies.\nSeparately, Sony hasn't weather-sealed the III. Again, that's a feature I'd like to see on such an expensive camera. Thankfully, battery life is improved, with the RX1R III supporting Sony's larger NP-FW50 batteries. I could comfortably get a day of shooting out of the latest model if I was good about powering off the camera when I wasn't using it.\nI could overlook all the complaints I mentioned if Sony had just added in-body image stabilization (IBIS). When I reviewed the Fujifilm X100VI last year, that feature alone felt transformational. More than just improving image quality, it made the X100VI into a camera that could shoot in nearly any light. I understand Sony likely wanted to keep the III small and light, but again, $5,100 is a lot to pay to not have a feature that many high-end cameras offer.\nWrap-up\nI've mentioned a few of the RX1R III’s competitors in passing, but now I think it makes sense to consider where Sony's new camera fits in the market. Most people shopping for a premium compact camera will probably start their search with the X100VI. If you can find one in stock, it's significantly cheaper than the RX1R III, coming in at $1,800. Sure, you're forgoing a full-frame sensor for a smaller APS-C sensor. But for most people, I think that's a fair tradeoff, especially when the X100VI also offers IBIS, an articulating screen, an optical viewfinder and Fujifilm's excellent color simulations.\nIf you want the largest possible sensor, I'd argue Fujifilm's GFX100RF, which has a medium-format 100MP sensor, makes more sense — even with all of its faults and a price increase coming at the end of the month. There are also the Leica Q3 and Q3 43 to consider. At $6,735 and $7,380 respectively, both are more expensive than the RX1R III, but come with nicer displays, IBIS and Leica glass.\nLike I said at the start, I wish the RX1R III was easier to recommend, but it occupies a strange space where it's not necessarily better or different enough from its rivals. Inflation and Trump's tariffs likely tied Sony's hands to a degree, but the company could have still made the new model more compelling by avoiding some of its questionable design decisions.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cameras/sony-rx1r-iii-review-waiting-10-years-to-be-underwhelmed-160036397.html?src=rss",

They can specify whether the AI should provide tutoring support for specific assignments while encouraging students to work independently on others. To promote a low-pressure learning environment, MathGPT.ai has also introduced unlimited practice questions for students. Because these freestanding chatbots will go in that direction, right?

    "summary": "Bose announced its latest earbuds in June, but the QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds (2nd gen) ($299) won’t arrive until early September. Today, though, they’re available for preorder, and I’ve spent the last few weeks testing all the new features. This model is an overhaul of the noise-canceling earbuds the company debuted in 2023 alongside its take on spatial audio. Among the upgrades, Bose has improved the active noise cancellation (ANC) performance, enhanced call quality and added wireless charging to the case. Two years later, the QuietComfort Ultra is still the best option for those primarily concerned with blocking distractions, and Bose’s tweaks make its best earbuds even better.\n \nWhat’s new on the QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds (2nd gen)?\nThe new QC Ultra Earbuds are at their best in Quiet mode. This is Bose’s option for full noise cancellation without spatial audio (or Immersive Audio, as the company calls it). Here, there’s no doubt these are still the best noise-cancelling earbuds available right now. The first-gen version achieved the same feat, but Bose has gone a step further to enhance its ANC setup for this refresh. \nSpecifically, the company updated the algorithm for its ActiveSense technology in Aware (transpancy) Mode. Now the QC Ultra Earbuds offer smoother changes in ANC levels to combat sudden spikes in ambient noise. This means things like sirens should no longer drown out your music or podcast. Unfortunately, I wasn’t able to trigger the retooled adaptive ANC with simulated police sirens from YouTube — the best option on my quiet cul-de-sac — but I’ll report back if I notice any oddities here.\nBose also upgraded call quality on the QC Ultra Earbuds. The company says a new AI-powered setup, known as SpeechClarity, works with “the earbuds’ eight microphones, dynamic mixing and adaptive filters” to focus on your voice. Bose explains that it uses audio augmentation tech that was originally developed for hearing aids here, which can reduce background noise like wind or the drone of an office. During my tests, the revised system silenced a noisy fan, rendering it completely absent from my recordings. However, overall voice quality suffers as you will sound a bit staticky when all the audio processing kicks in.\nThankfully, you no longer need an additional accessory for wireless charging on the QC Ultra Earbuds. With the first-gen model, you had to buy a separate cover to enable cable-free recharging. Bose has now built all of that into the case for the second-gen set, a welcome upgrade that really should’ve been here from the start. When the original QC Ultra Earbuds debuted in 2023, wireless charging was certainly already the norm.\nWhat’s still great about the QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds (2nd gen)?\n\n\n\n\n   Billy Steele for Engadget \n \n\nAs I mentioned, the overall ANC performance of the QC Ultra Earbuds remains unmatched. If you’re looking to block out distractions, this is the best option that still offers great sound quality. Bose even manages to cancel out human voices better than most of its rivals, which can be a struggle for much of the competition.\nAudio quality on these earbuds remains near the top of the heap. You won’t notice as much detail as Noble Audio’s FoKus Rex5 or Technics’ AZ100, but there’s great clarity here nonetheless. Bose says the tuning was “slightly refined” for improved bass response and smoother high frequencies. I noticed that tracks with deep bass, like Deftones’ “locked club,” are clearer at the low end. Meanwhile, treble-forward instruments in songs like Miles Davis’ “Green Haze” sound crisper and cleaner than before.\nDespite their larger size, this year’s buds offer a surprisingly balanced and comfortable fit. Bose refreshed the ear tips for the QC Ultra Earbuds with a new guard to prevent wax build up. Touch controls are still reliable, and you can disable them entirely on this second-gen version.\nWhat’s not so good about the QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds (2nd gen)?\nThe biggest gripe I have with the overhaul of the QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds is the lack of improvement to battery life. I was disappointed to see that a better runtime wasn’t part of the upgrades when I read the announcement in June, and I’m still not over it. On this model, you’ll get up to six hours of use with ANC turned on. Like before, if you listen with that spatial Immersive Audio enabled, that drops to four hours. A couple more hours would’ve been nice, enough to keep the QC Ultra Earbuds in place for a full work day without having to give them a lunch break in the case.\nWhile the design doesn’t bother me too much, I know the look of the QC Ultra Earbuds isn’t for everyone. There is a bit of a mini Bluetooth headset vibe going on here, and the overall size of the buds are on the larger side when much of the competition is racing to be the smallest. Like I said, none of this impacts comfort or stability, and I’d bet many prospective buyers are willing to live with the aesthetic in exchange for the type of silence the QC Ultra Earbuds deliver.\nWrap-up\nThe upgrades on the second-gen QC Ultra Earbuds don’t make for a wildly new product, but they do provide enough for a notable improvement over the previous version. ANC and call performance are both enhanced, and though it’s late to the party, the addition of built-in wireless charging is a welcome change. Other updates, like the tuning tweaks and the ability to turn off touch controls, are quality-of-life changes that undoubtedly improve the overall experience. Bose has done all of this without changing the price from the 2023 model, which is a surprising choice in the current economic climate. Simply put, the QC Ultra Earbuds remain the best option for wireless noise-cancelling earbuds, and that’s not likely to change anytime soon.\nThe Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds (2nd gen) are available for preorder in the US today, August 28. The general on-sale date is scheduled for September 10.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/bose-quietcomfort-ultra-earbuds-2nd-gen-review-still-a-noise-canceling-powerhouse-153017601.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Labor Day marks the unofficial end to summer as the weather starts to get crisper and students head back to school for the new semester. It also marks a good time to check out the tech deals available across the web. While seasonal holidays like Memorial Day and Labor Day are not the boon for tech sales that shopping events like Amazon Prime Day are, they can present good opportunities to save on things like laptops, tablets, smart home gear and more.Here, we've curated the best Labor Day sales on tech we could find this year. Since this time of year does overlap with the back-to-school season, students should be first in line to check out these deals. If you need some new gadgets for college, or refreshed tech to help you out in your first job after graduating, now's the time to see if you can get it for less. Student discounts are handy and exclusive to those who can prove their student status, but the good thing about Labor Day sales is that anyone can take advantage of them — student ID not required.\nBest Labor Day sales: Engadget's top picks\n \nApple MacBook Air (13-inch, M4) for $799 ($200 off): Apple's latest MacBook Air is the top pick in our guide to the best laptops, and it earned a score of 92 in our review. The M4 model isn't a major refresh overall, but that's not a bad thing — the design remains exceptionally thin, light and well-built, with long battery life and a top-notch keyboard and trackpad. Now it's a bit faster thanks to the updated chipset. \nApple iPad (11-inch, A16) for $299 ($50 off): Apple's entry-level iPad is, unsurprisingly, the best iPad option for those on a budget. It has solid performance thanks to the A16 chipset, 128GB of storage in the base model and good battery life.\nApple iPad Air (11-inch, M3) for $449 ($150 off): The latest iPad Air is a relatively minor update; the only big addition is a more powerful M3 chip. However, we still recommend this iPad over the base model in our iPad buying guide: Its display is more color-rich and better at fending off glare, its speakers are more robust, it works with Apple’s best accessories and its performance should hold up better in the years ahead.\nSony WH-CH520 wireless headphones for $38 (46 percent off): Sony makes headphones at all price ranges, and the WH-CH520 provides good sound quality and long battery life at an affordable price. They support custom EQ with Sony's mobile app, multipoint connectivity, a built-in microphone and up to 50 hours of battery life.\nAmazon Kindle Colorsoft (16GB) for $220 ($30 off): This is the latest version of Amazon's color ereader that has half of the storage of the original model, but otherwise functions the same. That makes it a little cheaper to start off, but you're still getting a 7-inch color e-paper display, full access to the Kindle shop and a waterproof design. We also appreciate that the Colorsoft comes with no lockscreen ads by default.\nGoogle Pixel 10 smartphone + $100 Amazon gift card for $799 ($100 off): More of a pre-order deal than a Labor Day deal, this bundle includes a free gift card when you order the latest Google Pixel phone in advance. You'll find different gift card deals at Amazon depending on which phone you go with: the Pixel 10 Pro and Pro XL have a $200 gift cards included, while the Pixel 10 Pro Fold comes with a free $300 gift card.\nEufy 11S Max robot vacuum for $159 (43 percent off): This model is one of our favorite budget robot vacuums thanks to its slim design that lets you get underneath furniture more easily and strong suction power for its size. Note that it does not have Wi-Fi connectivity, but it comes with a remote that lets you control the robot to your liking.\nShark AI Ultra robot vacuum for $298 (50 percent off): This Shark robot vacuum is a version of one of our favorites and it comes with a auto-empty base that can hold up to 60 days worth of debris. It has strong suction power and home mapping capabilities, so you can tailor cleaning jobs to your liking in addition to putting the robot on a cleaning schedule.\nDyson 360 Vis Nav robot vacuum for $500 ($500 off): Dyson made one of the most impressive robovacs with the 360 Vis Nav. It has some of the strongest suction power of any robot vacuum I've tried, and its impressive obstacle avoidance allows it to move around furniture and other objects with basically not intervention from humans necessary.\nBlink Outdoor 4 security cameras (3 camera system) for $100 (47 percent off): Some of our favorite security cameras, Blink Outdoor 4 devices support 1080p video, two-way talk, motion alerts and night vision. The most convenient thing about these is that they're totally wireless and run on AA batteries that can last up to two years before you need to replace them. That combined with their weather-proof design allows you to place them both inside and outside.\nCosori 9-in-1 air fryer for $90 (25 percent off): One of our picks for the best air fryers, this Cosori model has a spacious six-quart cooking basket and nine prep modes to choose from. In our testing, it consistently crisped up all kinds of foods, from frozen appetizers to raw proteins, and it has a nifty safety feature with its built-in basket release button.\nHORI Piranha Plant camera for Switch 2 for $40 (33 percent off): If you plan on taking advantage of the Switch 2's video and group chat feature, there's no cuter way to do it than with this Piranha Plant camera. In addition to using it with the pot as a stand, the plant itself detaches from the pot so you can use the camera in portable mode with the USB port on the new console.\nESPN Unlimited with Disney+ and Hulu (with ads) for $30/month ($6/month off): ESPN’s new streaming service is officially available now, and new subscribers can get Disney+ and Hulu included for one year when they sign up. The regular price of the new ESPN Unlimited plan is $30 per month, but this bundle offer throws in Disney+ and Hulu (with ads) for one year at no extra cost. If you want to break it down, you’re essentially getting each of the three services for $10 monthly with this offer.\nNordVPN deal — Get up to 77 percent off two-year plans: Most of NordVPN's two-year plans are on sale right now. You'll get 77 percent off the Prime tier, bringing the price down to $189 for 27 months of service (Nord throws in an extra three months for free). Arguably the best plan for most people is the Plus tier, which is 73 percent off and down to $108 for the 27-month term.\nMasterClass deal — Get 50 percent off one-year subscriptions: You can sign up for one year of MasterClass access for as low as $5 per month thanks to this sale that runs through September 1. A subscription lets you watch hundreds of online video classes taught by experts in their fields, and subject matter ranges from writing to cooking to sports.\nBest Labor Day sales on tech\n\nApple 24-inch iMac (M4) for $1,149 ($150 off)\n8Bitdo Ultimate 2C Wired Controller for $15 (25 percent off)\nXbox wireless gaming controller for $54 (17 percent off)\nRoku Ultra streamer for $79 (21 percent off)\nSony WH-1000XM4 wireless headphones for $198 (43 percent off)\nAnker Laptop Power Bank (25K, 100W) for $95 (30 percent off)\nGovee RGBIC Floor Lamp Basic for $60 (40 percent off)\nAmazon Fire Max 11 tablet for $175 (24 percent off)\nNothing Headphones (1) for $269 ($30 off)\n\nMore Labor Day sales\n\nAmazon Labor Day sale: Get up to 40 percent off headphones, earbuds, tech accessories and more\nBest Buy Labor Day sale: Get up to 50 percent off appliances, laptops, TVs, smartphones and more\nWalmart Labor Day sale: Save hundreds on electronics including TVs, laptops, headphones and more\nDyson Labor Day sale: Save up to $500 on vacuums, hair care and more\nSonos Labor Day sale: Save up to 25 percent on headphones and speakers\nTherabody Labor Day sale: Save up to $150 on percussion massage guns and more\nOoni Labor Day sale: Get 20 percent off the Koda 2 Max and save on other pizza ovens\nSolo Stove Labor Day sale: Get 20 percent off fire pits and 15 percent off select accessories\nMeater Labor Day sale: Get up to 27 percent off smart meat thermometers\n\nFollow @EngadgetDeals on X for the latest tech deals and buying advice.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-labor-day-sales-for-2025-get-up-to-50-percent-off-gear-from-apple-dyson-sony-and-others-120049238.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "We're now less than two weeks away from the Apple iPhone 17 event. Themed \"Awe dropping\" this year, the event — confirmed after Apple sent \"save the date\" invitations to the media on August 26 — will be livestreamed on YouTube September 9 at 1PM ET from Cupertino. And Engadget staff will be there, reporting and liveblogging from Apple Park to give their hands-on impressions. This year is shaking up to be a departure from recent September product rollouts, with the strong possibility of an all-new superthin iPhone expected to join the company's lineup. Also on tap could be new Apple Watch models — including the first truly new Ultra model in two years — and (maybe) the long-awaited AirPods Pro 3.\nThat rumored thin iPhone — possibly called the iPhone Air — would be the newcomer of what's expected to be four new handsets this year. Expected to be roughly 5.55 mm thick, it would be the thinnest iPhone yet, besting 2014's iPhone 6 which, at 6.9 mm, was the previous svelteness champ. And they've only gotten chunkier since then. (The iPhone 16 Pro has a depth of 8.25 mm.) The Air would also give Apple a direct rival to Samsung's Galaxy S25 Edge, which we found to be more than a gimmick.\nApple (screenshot)\nBut the iPhone Air's thin design will likely lead to some compromises. It's rumored to have only a single 48 MP camera and a smaller battery. So, expect a stylish phone that... won't be for everyone.\nThe Pro lineup could offer some design tweaks and performance improvements. The iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max are rumored to switch from titanium to aluminum. They could also see the rear camera array expand to an entire \"island\" that extends across most of the phone's backside. It's expected to house three cameras (as before), but multiple rumors have suggested it will have an improved telephoto one. The zoom lens could jump to 48MP, which would strengthen its digital zooming / cropping chops. The phones may also add an anti-glare coating, similar to those found on iPads.\nThe standard iPhone 17 could see some welcome display upgrades. At least one supply chain source claimed it will add a 120Hz variable refresh rate (ProMotion) display, which the Pro series has used since 2021.\nApple\nOne thing we know without a doubt is that the new iPhones will launch with iOS 26, which brings Apple's biggest design refresh in years. It's easy to imagine the company highlighting the new model's displays as the best way to experience the new Liquid Glass visual language. As for the naming scheme, there haven't been any leaks pointing to a similar hardware rebranding (\"iPhone 26,\" \"iPhone 26 Pro,\" etc.). But hey, Apple does like surprises.\nEngadget's iPhone 17 rumor roundup gives you a deeper dive into what to expect from the new models.\nCherlynn Low for Engadget\nApple's fall event isn't just for iPhones. The company is also expected to roll out new Apple Watch models. 5G and a processor upgrade are expected for the Apple Watch Ultra 3. It may also let you send texts via satellite, handy for those who use it out in the wilderness. Regardless of the details, Apple hasn't launched a new rugged and premium model since 2023 (apart from a new color), so it's due for an upgrade.\nThe Series 11 model is unlikely to depart dramatically from the Series 10. After all, that model introduced a new design, with a thinner body and larger screen. (And Apple has historically kept those around in three-year cycles.). But a faster chip also seems logical. Perhaps we'll see 5G arrive on the standard wearable, too.\nWe may also see the AirPods Pro 3 at the event. It's been about three years since Apple last upgraded its premium earbuds. The new model could also bring some biometric sensors to the earphones: an in-ear heart-rate monitor and (maybe) temperature sensing. Live translation is also rumored, although that may not be exclusive to the third-gen model. But don't expect major design changes, if the latest reports from leaker Majin Bu (via MacRumors) are to be believed: In addition to a \"slight reduction in size,\" Bu notes the case will lose the physical pairing button, while gaining capacitive controls.\nWill there be other announcements? Time will tell, but now we know we won't have to wait long to find out. The official countdown clock has begun, and the answers are just days away.\nUpdate, August 28, 2025, 10:45AM ET: Added new report on AirPods 3 case details. \nUpdate, August 26, 2025, 5:41PM ET: Added confirmation of official event invitation, date and time. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/apples-iphone-17-awe-dropping-event-is-on-september-9--heres-what-we-expect-090059664.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "As soon as I picked up Honor’s Magic V5, I was a little concerned about its durability. The fourth generation of Honor’s Android foldable may not be massively thinner than its predecessor, but it sure feels like it. Yes, it’s built with aerospace-grade materials to make it sturdy despite its svelteness, but it’s also the first foldable I’d insist on buying a case for because goodness me, it’s thin.\nIf you recall, the last handset in this series was the Magic V3 and no, you haven’t fallen asleep and missed a year. The number four can represent bad luck in Chinese culture as its Cantonese form (sei) sounds almost identical to the word for death (séi). Consequently, we’ve skipped a model number.\nThe V5 is so svelte it’ll barely make an impression on your pants pocket, measuring 8.8mm folded and 4.1mm open. That’s not a big difference to the V3’s 9.2mm / 4.35mm, but it certainly feels like a rubicon has been crossed. It’s worth noting Honor is marking its own homework with one eye closed here, since it can only reach that thickness with the white V5. The other colorways (black, red and gold) stack up at 9mm / 4.2mm, which is almost the same as Samsung’s Z Fold 7.\nPhoto by Daniel Cooper for Engadget\nNaturally, a premium foldable deserves premium internals, and the V5 packs a Snapdragon 8 Elite with 16GB RAM and 512GB storage. There’s a 5,820mAh silicon carbon battery that, when paired with the company’s usual AI power-management tools, promises nearly 50 hours of life on a charge. I won’t comment on that claim but I can say this is the snappiest and fastest Honor foldable I’ve laid my eyes and hands on. There’s no lag or delay when switching displays, and everything feels like it’s already served up seconds before you’ve even asked for it.\nBut in the same way no modern smartphone is a dramatic departure from what went before, the rest of the story here is nips and tucks. The Magic V5 has the same 6.43-inch cover display as the V3, and the main screen has grown only slightly, from 7.92 inches to 7.95 inches. The only useful tweak is support for Honor’s MagicPen stylus on both screens, but it’s the same size as an Apple Pencil, so you’ll need to find a place to store it.\nPhoto by Daniel Cooper for Engadget\nIt’s a similar story of modest changes on the imaging front as the V5 is equipped with a 50-megapixel f/1.6 primary camera with OIS. That's paired with a 64-megapixel, f/2.5 periscope telephoto (also with OIS) and a 50-megapixel f/2.0 ultra-wide. Overall, that’s an improvement on the previous model, but both selfie cameras (in the cover and primary display) are the same 20-megapixel shooter found in the V3. Of course, performance is bolstered by the usual AI features that may or may not be useful.\nHonor has announced European pricing for the V5, with it costing €1,999 (around $2,317) in the EU and £1,699 (around $2,283) in the UK. That puts it in the same rough bracket as the Z Fold 7, although there's so many deals and discounts these days you can always save money if you look. I'm still not sure if Honor isn't selling itself short by not undercutting its rivals more aggressively, but it must feel it can compete, and win, against Samsung and the like on an even playing field. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/honors-magic-v5-foldable-almost-feels-too-thin-143022082.html?src=rss",

I'm still not sure if Honor isn't selling itself short by not undercutting its rivals more aggressively, but it must feel it can compete, and win, against Samsung and the like on an even playing field."

    "full_text": "There is a spec war going on among companies to claim the crown of thinnest foldable. Honor is winning this race on a theoretical basis with its 8.8 mm (when folded) thick Magic V5 foldable. I’m saying theoretical because there is a huge, camera-bump-sized caveat to this. Apart from that, the phone is a solid piece of hardware. The front display is a 6.43-inch screen with 2376 x 1060 resolution, and the main (unfolded) display is a 7.95-inch screen with 2172 x 2352 pixels. The company said it’s using a carbon fiber reinforced inner panel for better fall protection. So far, I haven’t seen notable scratches on either screen. Honor has included a bunch of AI editing tools with the phone. There is an AI eraser that lets you draw on objects to remove them. I tested this feature with a French-speaking friend, and the results were very good."

Lovable CEO Anton Osika isn’t currently engaging with the flurry of inbound interest, the Times says, which comes a few weeks after the startup announced a $200 million round at a $1.8 billion valuation in a deal led by Accel. A Lovable spokesperson told TechCrunch that the company isn’t fundraising now. Lovable has grown quickly over its short lifespan. In July, the startup said its annual recurring revenue had surpassed $100 million with more than 10 million projects built using the platform. The astounding trajectory of Europe’s hottest unicorn comes just nine months after Lovable launched and comes on the heels of investor interest in vibe-coding startups. Cursor-maker Anysphere raised $900 million in May, more than tripling its valuation to $9 billion. Got a sensitive tip or confidential documents?

    "summary": "DJI's busy engineering team is at it again with the creation of the company's third wireless mic system in less than two years. The new flagship DJI Mic 3 has a wholesale design change from the Mic 2 plus numerous improvements in areas like sound quality, noise reduction and the number of subjects you can record at once — though there is one downgrade compared to to the last model. I've had one for over a week so I'll provide some impressions as well.\nThe most noticeable change with the Mic 3 is the smaller transmitter size and lighter weight. It weighs just 16 grams (.58 ounces) compared to 28 grams (.99 ounces) for the Mic 2, though it's bigger and heavier than the Mic Mini transmitter (10 grams). DJI has also improved the transmitter mounting options, introducing a rotating clip along with the magnetic option. There's even a choice of five colors for the windscreen to better match your subject's clothing. \nThe smaller size and rotating clip makes the Mic 3 more discreet and easier to attach to any shirt or hat. However, there's still a large \"DJI\" logo on both sides of the transmitter that looks ugly but gives the company free advertising, I suppose. \n\n\n\n\n  Steve Dent for Engadget\n \n\nThe charging case holds a receiver and two transmitters and, unlike the last model, now lets you insert the transmitter with the magnetic mount and windscreen still attached. Fully charged transmitters can run for about eight hours and the receiver can go 10 hours. However, the case provides enough power to charge all three devices 2.4 times for about 28 hours of extended use. This feature makes the Mic 3 useful for marathon shoots and was key to the success of the original DJI Mic, though competitors like Sennheiser have caught on and introduced similar cases.\nThe Mic 3 now supports up to four transmitters and eight receivers at once. That means you can record four subjects at a time to as many as eight receivers simultaneously for multi-camera shoots (if you purchase the extra kits, of course). I wasn't able to test this feature as I had just a single kit, but it'll be handy for large jobs if it works as advertised. \nTo make syncing and lining up all that audio and video simpler, the Mic 3 now offers high-precision timecode capture embedded during internal recording. I tested this feature with two cameras, and once I figured out how to align the shots in DaVinci Resolve, it proved to be a valuable post-production timesaver.\n\n\n\n\n  DJI\n \n\nThe receiver can also be set to quadrophonic mode for select Sony cameras and software, allowing independent output of four channels at once to a single camera. DJI is promising a range of 400 meters (around 1,300 feet) and strong resistance to interference via automatic frequency hopping between the 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands.\nThere are some major improvements in audio quality as well. It's DJI's first microphone with two adaptive gain control modes. For noisy outdoor environments like sporting events, Automatic mode suppresses sudden volume spikes to prevent clipping. Dynamic mode, meanwhile, adjusts gain on the fly in response to volume changes to ensure consistent loudness in quieter settings like studios. \nI tested this feature in Paris in a relatively quiet studio and outside with traffic and other city noises. The Automatic setting did a good job suppressing those unwanted sounds without a noticeable impact on audio quality. And the dynamic mode kept my speaking levels steady even when I trailed off at the end of sentences, again without impacting voice timbre or clarity. \n\n\n\n\n  DJI\n \n\nThe Mic 3 is also DJI's first with three tone presets (Regular, Rich and Bright) to handle different voice characteristics (medium, low and high pitches). This feature also worked as advertised. Set to \"Regular,\" I needed less equalization than usual to even out my voice and it worked equally well on a higher-pitched female voice. \nTwo-level active noise cancelation reduces background sounds like air conditioning and wind noise. Again, this worked effectively, though like any noise reduction algorithm, it impacted voice quality by artificially reducing some frequencies. Finally, the lossless audio feature lets the mic send uncompressed 48kHz 24-bit audio directly to the receiver to eliminate any MPEG audio artifacts. This is likely overkill for most use cases. While the Mic 3 offers good sound quality, it's nowhere close to a dedicated high-end studio microphone — so you'll be hard pressed to notice any difference.\nDJI also added internal dual-file 24-bit and 32-bit float recording, which records the highest quality possible without any clipping. That allows you to capture two files of 32-bit float sound without algorithmic changes, two channels of 24-bit sound with algorithmic changes or one of each. That's an improvement over the Mic 2, which only captured a single file of the original sound internally in 32-bit float. \n\n\n\n\n  DJI\n \n\nThere's one key feature missing on DJI's Mic 3 that might make it a non-starter for some audio pros. Unlike the Mic 2, the transmitter lacks a 3.5mm mic port for wired lav or other microphones. That means you're relying on the Mic 3's built in microphone, and although it offers high quality sound, may not be high enough for applications like broadcast. \nFinally, the Mic 3 works with DJI's OsmoAudio system, so it pairs with the Osmo 360, Osmo Action 5 Pro, Action 4 and Osmo Pocket without the need for a receiver. I tested it with the Osmo 360 and Action 5 Pro and it connected without any issues. For other devices, you can wire it in via a 3.5mm TRS port, TRRS monitoring and a USB-C port, or to smartphones via Bluetooth or USB-C using the included adapter. \nDJI's Mic 3 is now on sale in most territories, priced at $329 in a kit with a charging case plus two transmitters and a receiver, or $219 with a single transmitter and receiver.\n\n\nUpdate, August 28, 2025, 9:45AM ET: This story was updated with US sales links. DJI originally said the Mic 3 wasn't available in the US yet, but the company changed course and the new product can be purchased from DJI or Amazon.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/djis-much-smaller-mic-3-can-record-four-subjects-at-once-120032192.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "The back-to-school season is a good time to save on tech, whether you're returning to campus or not. While some discounts are reserved for students, others are available to everyone. One of the best right now is on Apple's M3-powered iPad Air, which is somewhat of a goldilocks tablet — one that will be a great option for just about everyone. You can grab it for $150 off at Amazon right now.\nThis deal applies to each configuration of the 11-inch and 13-inch versions of the most recent iPad Air. So, the 11-inch model is as low as $449, while the 13-inch model is down to $649. The same deals can be found at Best Buy and Target if you prefer to shop somewhere other than Amazon. This is an all-time low price and beats the deal we saw on Prime Day by $30. \n \nThe iPad Air M3 is more of an iterative refresh than a grand overhaul, but the spec bump means it’ll last you a long time before the tablet’s performance becomes a problem. This iPad occupies the position of \"best for most\" in our iPad buying guide, reinforcing that goldilocks analogy. The M3 chip is the main draw here, with Geekbench 6 scores proclaiming it around 16 percent more powerful than the M2 iPad Air, which is no slouch itself.\nBeyond the chip, it has a superior display and speakers to the entry-level model, and wider accessory support. You also get the option of a 13-inch display, which is great for artists or anyone who sees the iPad as a viable laptop replacement.\nIf there’s an obvious downside to the iPad Air M3, it’s that it doesn't have the nice 120Hz OLED display of the iPad Pro. This is hardly surprising, as Apple often focuses on display tech to differentiate its Pro and non-Pro devices, but it’s probably time the refresh rate on the middle-of-the-road iPad at least jumped up to ProMotion. Face ID is long overdue too. If you can live with these caveats, though, the iPad Air is an excellent option, particularly at this price.\nIf you think the Air is too much for your needs, the iPad A16, Apple's entry-level tablet, is down to $299 right now. It was slightly cheaper during Prime Day in July, but this discount is still worth considering if you're looking to pick up a newer iPad for less.\n \nCheck out our coverage of the best Apple deals for more discounts, and follow @EngadgetDeals on X for the latest tech deals and buying advice.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/apples-ipad-air-m3-gets-a-150-discount-for-labor-day-162908706.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Early this summer, my wife and I had an inconvenient realization: we may need to be in two places at once. An urgent doctor appointment could conflict with YMCA day camp pickup, or our kids would get invited to two birthday parties on the same morning at godforsaken activity centers in separate towns. There was no doubt we needed another car. A big ticket purchase seemed unjustifiable when we don't know what eggs will cost next month — and my search for an aftermarket Prius within my budget was strangely fruitless. As it turns out though, now might be the best time to grab a used EV.\nDuring my search, I saw BMW i3s (those freakish go-kart looking EVs) and VW e-Golfs selling for around $15,000, both of which are more fun to drive and have better tech features than older Prii. Couple those low prices with the soon-to-be-expired EV tax credit — which can get you up to $4,000 off certain used EVs and plug-in hybrids (PHEVS) — and some cars could cost $10,000 or less! Meanwhile, I couldn't find a decent 2015 Prius below $17,000.\nLong story short, I settled on a boring-yet-secretly-fun option: A 2018 Nissan Leaf. It has a range of 150 miles and a hatchback design that looks less funky than the original bug-eyed sub-compact. It accelerates quickly, it's relatively engaging to drive and it also has premium leather seats, radar-assisted cruise control and a decent Bose speaker system. Not bad for something close to $15,000 with only 33,000 miles!\nEven though it's worth far less than our stately Volvo XC90, I genuinely have more fun zipping around town in the Nissan Leaf. There's the magic of the instant torque you get from its electric motor, the convenience of one-pedal driving (Nissan calls it \"e-pedal\") and its cherry red paint lets me pretend I'm having a mid-life Miata crisis like my middle school rhetoric teacher. Plus it can easily fit a large toddler car seat and a booster for my six-year old, and it has enough trunk space to deal with massive grocery hauls. Thank god I didn't get a Prius.\nDevindra Hardawar for Engadget\nWhy are used EVs so cheap?\nMany EVs just don't hold their value — you can blame the fast-evolving EV components and consumer uncertainty for that. But that also means you can find gently used models for far less than their list price. If I was less responsible and pushed my budget a bit higher, I'd absolutely consider a recent Hyundai Ioniq 5 for around $25,000. It's well-reviewed, and it looks like an '80s retro-future hatchback. What's not to love?\n(And yes, you could also look for used Teslas if you want. I can't vouch for the quality of that brand, and personally I wouldn't recommend getting stuck in its ecosystem.)\nYou can find even deeper discounts for less popular cars, like the Polestar 2 (which would honestly look great in my driveway next to its Volvo cousin). That luxury EV started at $61,000 at launch — but now it's easy to find used Polestar 2s for around $25,000.\nNo matter which used EV you're looking at, be sure to check out its battery health level. Most early EVs relied on air cooling for their batteries, and their chemistry isn't advanced as modern cars, which means degradation can be common. You can typically find a battery health indicator in a car's settings, but OBD sensors and apps like LeafSpy may provide a more accurate sense of their longevity.\n\nSo long, EV tax credit\nThe Biden-era EV tax credit can also shave off up to $4,000 from select used EVs and $7,500 from new models, but unfortunately thanks to Trump's \"Big Beautiful Bill\" it's likely to be discontinued at the end of September. I've seen some dealers highlight cars eligible for tax credits, and that's also true for online stores like Carvana. Just be sure to check the IRS requirements — notably, the new vehicle credit only applies for individuals earning less than $150,000 and married couples filing jointly who earn less than $300,000.\nThe used vehicle credit is even more restrictive, as it only applies to individuals earning less than $75,000 and married joint filers earning under $150,000. Additionally, qualifying EVs have to be priced under $25,000, and must be 2023 models or older. You'll also have to buy the used EV from a dealer — personal sales don't apply.\n\nHow I learned to deal with range anxiety\nOne major reason older EVs have gotten cheaper is that they often offer relatively low driving ranges. The 2021 BMW i3 can run up to 153 miles, but older models topped out at 85 miles (there are also Range Extender models that use a small gas engine to slowly recharge the battery). My 2018 Leaf tops out at 150 miles, but there are also \"Leaf Plus\" models that can reach up to 226 miles.\nThose numbers are a long way off from the 300-miles or so we expect from new EVs and gas cars, but I'd also argue the shorter range isn't a huge deal for many people. US DOT data tells us that 95 percent of trips in personal vehicles cover less than 31 miles, and the average driver travels 37 miles per day. That makes low-range EVs ideal as secondary vehicles for local driving.\nBetween day-care pickup, grabbing groceries and other local errands, I rarely drive more than 20 miles a day in my Leaf. That typically eats up only 10 to 15 percent of charge per day, depending on how much I need to blast the AC to deal with Georgia summers.\nNow I won't deny that you wouldn't want to go road tripping with a low-range EV, especially with America's messy charging infrastructure. Low-range EVs aren't for everyone. But if that's your worry, I'd just recommend avoiding the cheap sub-$15,000 used EVs. You'll find plenty of models with bigger batteries near $25,000.\nDevindra Hardawar for Engadget\nCharging might be easier than you think\nIf you can string a 25 foot power cord outside, you can easily Level 1 trickle charge an EV. And for moderate drivers, that may be all they need to keep their car juiced up. If I plug in my Nissan Leaf at 5PM, it can typically charge up by 40 percent by 8AM, thanks to its small battery. For larger EVs like the Kia EV9, I can usually get 10 to 15 percent of a charge overnight.\nOf course, things become more complicated if you're in your car all day and need faster charging, or if extreme weather causes your battery to drain faster than usual. At that point, you'll either have to seek out a public charging point, or get a Level 2 charger installed at home. Neither option is especially difficult, but they're more annoying than simply going to a gas station for a few minutes. I wouldn't be surprised if that's the big stumbling block pushing mainstream shoppers away from EVs.\nFrom what I've seen, though, many people are just hesitant to break their existing habits. If you have the ability to install a Level 2 charger in your garage, it's not especially difficult or expensive (though running an extra power line could be a big spend). And EV chargers are also popping up like weeds in shopping centers, so it may not be that tough to park up and charge while running errands.\nIn my case, I’m perfectly fine running a Level 1 charger to an outlet near my front door. That does mean I’ll occasionally have a thick electrical cord draped across my front porch (something I’m sure my wife just loves), but I can live with it for now. I do plan to get a Level 2 charger installed eventually though — it’ll make testing EVs a lot easier, and I can prepare myself for a more spacious family EV to replace our gas guzzling SUV.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/its-the-perfect-time-to-buy-a-cheap-used-ev-123015687.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Streaming services keep raising prices. At this point, if you subscribe to all the major services out there, you're basically paying the same price as cable — those antiquated local monopolies that streaming was supposed to save us from. But streaming still has one big advantage over the old ways: no contracts. That means you can grab a good streaming deal and then cancel without penalty.\nOur advice is to sign up for a service when you see a good streaming deal (or the latest season of, say, Doctor Who, Severance, Andor and/or The Last of Us). Then, when the deal ends or you've binged whatever it is you want to watch, cancel as needed. But streaming deals don't come around all that often and, when they do, it's easy to miss them thanks to...everything. So we're keeping eyes out for the best streaming deals out there and we update this guide often — so check it out the next time you have a hankering to watch something new. \nBest streaming deals\nTrue streaming deals can be hard to come by. Most often, they’ll pop up during the Black Friday shopping period. On occasion, we’ll see them sparingly throughout the year and they usually take the form of a discounted monthly or annual rate for a limited period of time. Also, true streaming deals are typically on the ad-supported versions of a service, but once in a while you’ll find a unicorn of a deal on a tier that has ad-free viewing.\nIf you’re able to wait for a deal before subscribing to a streaming service, we recommend doing so. You’ll save money upfront and in the long run, and you also have the option to cancel your subscription before the price goes back up to the normal rate. Maybe you find you like the service so much that you’re fine paying full price for it — that’s the ideal situation. But if you’re not compelled to keep that app on rotation in your smart TV, most streaming services make it easy for you to cancel at any time. With that said, these are the best streaming deals you can snag right now.\n\n\nDirecTV starting at $50/month for one month ($35 off): All of DirecTV's signature packages are $35 off right now for your first month when you sign up. If you opt for the base \"Entertainment\" package, you'll spend $50 for the first month and get access to over 90 channels, including many local stations as well as ESPN, ESPN 2 and Fox Sports 1. You'll also be able to watch on the go with the DirecTV mobile app.\nDashPass Annual + HBO Max (with ads) for $96/year ($144 off): This offer includes access to HBO Max with ads for no extra cost when you sign up for a DashPass Annual plan. You can then decide to upgrade to Max Standard, which removes ads, for a discounted rate of $11 monthly if you want. Aside from the obvious streaming benefits, this deal gives you $0 deliver fees and lower service fees on some restaurant DoorDash orders, five percent DoorDash credits on pickup orders, on-demand grocery delivery and other members-only exclusives.\nSpotify Premium Individual (3 month) for $0 ($36 off): This is our favorite music streaming service for podcasts and social features. Right now, users who have not signed up for Spotify's Premium service before are eligible to get three months for free. The Premium Individual plan lets you listen ad-free and skip songs at will. You can also organize your listening queue and download content for offline listening. Just be aware, your subscription will auto-renew at the end of the trial period. So if you don't want to be on the hook for the $12 monthly fee, set a reminder to cancel and go back to the free version.\nFubo Pro for $55/month for the first month ($30 off): Fubo has introductory discounts on most of its packages, and the Pro package is the least expensive plan currently listed. It offers access to 224 channels, unlimited cloud DVR and up to 10 simultaneous streams. It even includes regional sports content from the NHL, MLB and NBA.\nYouTube TV (three months) for $150 ($99 off): You can get three months of our favorite live TV streaming service for $50 per month. That should give you a decent chunk of time to see if the service is right for you while saving some cash. The discount and trial are only open to new subscribers to YouTube TV’s base plan, which includes access to over 100 channels, unlimited DVR space and six household accounts with the ability to stream on three devices at once. \nSling Orange for $23/month for the first month (50 percent off): New customers can get Sling Orange or Sling Blue for half off the usual price for the first month, bringing the final prices to $23/month and $25.50/month, respectively. Orange is likely best for sports fans, with eight exclusive sports and family channels, while Blue includes 19 exclusive news and entertainment channels. You can get both Orange and Blue access also for half off for one month, or $33 total.\nPeacock first responders discount — one year for $48 (50 percent off): Medical professionals and first responders can save 50 percent each year of Peacock. The deal requires annual verification and is open to those who work for either private or public institutions. Peacock has some great stuff to watch, including Poker Face and Killing It and more.\nStudent discounts on streaming services\nHBO Max student discount — subscribe for $5/month (50 percent off): HBO Max offers their ad-supported tier to students for half off the usual rate. You’ll just have to verify that you’re a student through Unidays, and make note that this offer is only good for up to 12 months of service.\nHulu student discount — subscribe for $2/month (75 percent off): Those with a valid student ID can get Hulu’s ad-supported tier for 75 percent off the typical rate. They’ll keep the same sale price for as long as they’re a student as well.\nSpotify student discount — Premium + Hulu with ads for $6/month (72 percent off): Spotify’s student offer continues to be one of the best around, giving you access to the Premium tier of the music streamer and Hulu’s ad-supported plan for only $6 monthly. Purchased separately, you’d pay $22 per month for both of the services. Plus, the first month is free when you sign up.\nNBA League Pass student discount — one year for $120 (40 percent off): Students can get one year of League Pass for only $10 per month, which includes access to NBA TV and the ability to watch classic and archive games on-demand. On the NBA League Pass website, look for the student discount banner at the top and follow the instructions to verify your student status.\nStreaming bundle discounts\nThere’s more consolidation happening now than ever before in the streaming space, and that means there are more streaming bundle options. These bundles offer you access to more content with one subscription price, but those prices are typically higher than paying for a single service by itself (obviously). It may be tempting to just get the bundle, but if only one of those services in the bundle speaks to you, you’ll spend less overall by just paying for the single service.\nSpeaking of a deep love for a single streaming service: if all of your favorite shows are on Peacock or the latest releases on HBO Max consistently bring you joy, consider paying for one year upfront. Subscribing with an annual plan usually saves you money in the long term over paying on a monthly basis. Unfortunately, not all streaming services (looking at you, Netflix) have an annual subscription option. Here are some of the best streaming bundles you can get right now.\n\n\nDisney+, Hulu, HBO Max bundle with ads for $17/month: Ad-supported HBO Max is included here, along with full, ad-supported access to Disney+ and Hulu. You’ll save 43 percent with this bundle, as opposed to paying for all three services individually.\nDisney+ and Hulu Bundle Premium for $20/month: Disney and Hulu offer a few different bundles, which you can view in the drop-down lists under Choose Your Plan. This bundle removes the ads from both Disney+ and Hulu (with the exception of select live and linear content) and allows you to download content for offline viewing. You’ll save 42 percent with this bundle, as opposed to paying for both ad-free tiers individually.\nHulu + Live TV with Disney+ and ESPN+ for $96/month: This streaming bundle amalgamation is a bit confusing but it does offer a lot: you get live TV streaming via Hulu’s service plus access to the following VOD services: Hulu, Disney+ and ESPN+. Out of those three, only ESPN+ will have ads.\nDisney+, Hulu, ESPN+ Bundle Basic for $17/month: You get full access to Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+ content with this package, albeit with ads across the board. This bundle price is 46 percent off the total price of all three separate subscriptions.\nDisney+, Hulu, ESPN+ Bundle Premium for $27/month: Similarly to the Duo bundles, the Premium version of the Trio removes ads from most content in Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+, and you can download content for offline viewing. This price represents a 43-percent savings when compared to paying for all three ad-free tiers separately.\nSling TV + HBO Max starting at $53/month: Sling TV and HBO Max have partnered on a discount that gives new subscribers 50 percent off their first month of Sling TV, plus $5 off monthly when you subscribe to the Sling TV + HBO Max bundle.

The deal requires annual verification and is open to those who work for either private or public institutions. Purchased separately, you’d pay $22 per month for both of the services. NBA League Pass student discount — one year for $120 (40 percent off): Students can get one year of League Pass for only $10 per month, which includes access to NBA TV and the ability to watch classic and archive games on-demand. These bundles offer you access to more content with one subscription price, but those prices are typically higher than paying for a single service by itself (obviously). Speaking of a deep love for a single streaming service: if all of your favorite shows are on Peacock or the latest releases on HBO Max consistently bring you joy, consider paying for one year upfront. Subscribing with an annual plan usually saves you money in the long term over paying on a monthly basis. You’ll save 43 percent with this bundle, as opposed to paying for all three services individually. You’ll save 42 percent with this bundle, as opposed to paying for both ad-free tiers individually. This price represents a 43-percent savings when compared to paying for all three ad-free tiers separately."

    "summary": "Dyson is holding a Labor Day sale right now, with discounts on a bunch of products. The well-reviewed 360 Vis Nav robot vacuum is available for just $500, which is a discount of 50 percent. That's a seriously great deal and the lowest price we've seen for this product.\nThe Vis Nav made our list of the best robot vacuums, primarily based on the unit's superior suction power. This thing can pull up dirt like a beast. We said it had the strongest suction power of any robovac we've tested and easily took out pet fur from a carpeted floor. We also noted in our official review that the power here was on par with Dyson's stick vacuums. \n\n\nThe unit includes a stellar obstacle avoidance system, with cameras and LED lights to help the vacuum navigate around furniture. During our testing we found it to be nearly flawless, as it only crashed into a chair leg a couple of times. Also, we never received any alerts that the robot got stuck somewhere while working.\nThe bin here is on the larger side, but there's no self-emptying base. This is also not a hybrid unit. It's a vacuum and not a mop. This made it tough to recommend the unit at $1,000, despite the fantastic suction, but $500 makes it a whole lot easier.\nThe Dyson V15s Detect Submarine is also down to $800 as part of this sale, which is a discount of $200. This cordless stick vacuum features a HEPA filtration system and advanced wet-cleaning capabilities. It's a great tool for cleaning both carpets and hard floors.\nFollow @EngadgetDeals on X for the latest tech deals and buying advice.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/dysons-labor-day-sale-includes-a-50-percent-discount-on-the-360-vis-nav-robot-vacuum-172759449.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "If your Wi-Fi signal is struggling to reach every corner of your home, a signal booster — also known as a Wi-Fi extender — might be the fix you need. Whether you're dealing with annoying dead zones, buffering video calls or laggy gaming sessions, the right Wi-Fi extender can help expand coverage and improve connectivity without forcing you to move your router.There are different types of Wi-Fi extenders to choose from. Some models use external antennas to push the signal farther, while others, like mesh extenders, create a seamless, whole-home network. If you're simply looking to extend coverage into a specific room, a Wi-Fi repeater can do the job — but it may cut your bandwidth in half. More advanced extenders, however, can help maintain strong speeds and reliability throughout your home.We've rounded up the best Wi-Fi extenders to suit different needs, whether you're looking for an affordable fix or a high-performance upgrade.\nTable of contents\n\nBest Wi-Fi extender for 2025\nHow do Wi-Fi extenders work?\nWhat to look for in a Wi-Fi extender\nWi-Fi extender FAQs\n\nBest Wi-Fi extender for 2025\n \n \n \nHow do Wi-Fi extenders work?\nThese handy wireless devices do exactly what their name suggests: extend your Wi-Fi network so it covers more areas of your home. Most wireless extenders plug into an AC outlet and connect to your existing router so they can then rebroadcast it to spots that your router alone may not cover well. As a rule of thumb, you’ll get the best results by placing the extender half way between your router and the dead zone you’re trying to fix or improve your W-Fi connection and strengthen the wireless signal. \nOne important thing to note about Wi-Fi range extenders (also sometimes called “repeaters”) is that most of them actually create a new Wi-Fi network when rebroadcasting your existing one. That network will have a new name (it’ll often be your default network’s name with an EXT appended at the end, unless you change it) and that means you’ll have to connect to different networks when in different parts of your home. While that’s a small tradeoff in return for improved internet connection, some will be more inconvenienced than others.\nIf you’d rather have one, much larger network in your home, you’re better off upgrading to mesh networking systems. Mesh systems come with a main router and a wireless access point or two that, by default, create one large Wi-Fi system that should be accessible throughout your whole home. They tend to be the best Wi-Fi routers you can get, but that also translates to more expensive, and possibly more complicated, devices. Mesh Wi-Fi systems are, by far, more costly than a simple extender, plus you may have to work with your internet service provider to get your home’s existing network working on your new router.\nWhat to look for in a Wi-Fi extender\nSpeed\nExtenders today can support single, dual or tri-band Wi-Fi, and they will tell you the maximum speeds they support on all of their available bands. For example, one dual-band device might support 600Mbps speeds over its 2.4GHz band and up to 1300Mbps over its 5GHz band, for a combined maximum speed of 1900Mbps. For the best performance, you’ll want to go with a Wi-Fi extender that has the highest speeds possible (and those, as you might expect, tend to cost more). Some extenders even support Wi-Fi 7, giving you the latest in wireless technology for higher bandwidth, faster internet speed and lower latency.\nHowever, it’s important to remember that Wi-Fi extenders are not true “signal boosters” since they are not designed to increase speeds across your home. In fact, you may find that the extender’s network is slower than your router’s. Instead, extenders are designed to increase the strong Wi-Fi coverage throughout your home, making them ideal for filling in dead zones. Some mesh extenders can help create a more seamless network, reducing the drop in speed and improving connectivity in larger spaces.\nRange, and number of supported devices\nWith the name of the gaming being coverage area, taking note of a device’s range is important. Depending on the size of your home and property, you may only need up to 1,200 square feet of coverage. But those with larger homes will want to spring for an extender that can support upwards of 2,000+ square feet of coverage.\nSimilarly, those with lots of gadgets will want an extender that can handle them all at once. If you spend most of your time on your phone or laptop and maybe have your smart TV online for a few hours of Netflix each day, you could get by with a more limited extender. Smart home aficionados and tech lovers should invest in one that won’t buckle under the pressure of a few dozen connected devices. This is especially important if you plan on linking all of the devices in a certain part of your home to your Wi-Fi range extender’s network, rather than directly to your existing router. Some models with external antennas can improve performance by providing stronger, more directional wireless signal.\nDesign\nThere isn’t a ton of innovation when it comes to design in the Wi-Fi extender space. Most of the ones you’ll find today are rounded rectangles roughly the size of your hand that plug into a standard wall outlet. They usually have a few indicator lights that will show you when the extender is connected, how strong its signal strength is and when there’s a problem, and some will even have moveable external antennas that companies claim provide even better Wi-Fi signal. Generally, they are pretty simple to install and get connected, but if you’re struggling with how to set up your Wi-Fi extender, there are plenty of YouTube videos you can check out.\nAside from that, there are the scant few standalone Wi-Fi extenders that sit on an end table or a desk, and those look pretty similar to regular ol’ routers. But make no mistake, anything labeled as an extender or a “Wi-Fi repeater” will need an anchor router in order for it to work.\nAnother convenient feature you’ll find on most Wi-Fi extenders is an extra Ethernet connection port (or a few). This allows you to use the extender as a wireless access point if you connect it to your existing router, or an adapter to provide devices like TVs, smart home hubs or game consoles a hardwired connection to the internet. Unsurprisingly, this wired connection usually provides you with the fastest speeds possible, so you may want to use it for your most crucial devices.\nWi-Fi extender FAQs\nWhat's the difference between a wifi booster and extender?\nNowadays, there’s really no difference between a Wi-Fi booster and Wi-Fi extender - they’re just different names for the same thing. Previously, however, Wi-Fi boosters were devices that received signals from wireless routers, broadcasting them to another network. This essentially extends the range of the signal. Wi-Fi extenders expand the coverage within your home’s Wi-Fi network, but often you will see extenders described as boosters.\nIs a Wi-Fi extender better than a mesh router?\nMesh routers, or mesh Wi-Fi systems, use multiple devices (or nodes) across your home to create a larger home network. Essentially, you have multiple routers around your home with these systems, and that will hopefully provide the best coverage possible. Wi-Fi extenders, on the other hand, are usually just one device that extends your existing Wi-Fi signal, and they often require you to switch networks when connecting. Wi-Fi extenders are more affordable, though, and are great if you’re traveling or need a Wi-Fi signal in harder-to-reach areas. However, a mesh router can offer a better long-term solution to upgrade your entire home’s Wi-Fi.\nShould I use multiple Wi-Fi extenders?\nSome people may need to use multiple Wi-Fi extenders, for instance, if your home is large or has dead zones in different areas. But if you do use multiple Wi-Fi extenders, there’s a chance of interference. You may also need to manually connect to the extenders separately, which isn’t always convenient.\nWhat is the maximum distance for a Wi-Fi extender?\nThe maximum distance for a Wi-Fi extender varies depending on the model, but most can effectively extend your wireless signal between 800 and 2,500 square feet. Some high-end models may reach even farther, especially if they feature external antennas or are part of a mesh system with additional dedicated wireless access points.\nHowever, keep in mind that real-world performance depends on factors like your home's layout, wall materials and interference from other devices. For best results, place your extender about halfway between your router and the area with weak or no Wi-Fi connection. Always check the manufacturer’s specs — some of our top picks clearly list their expected range so you can find one that fits your space.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/best-wifi-extender-130021313.html?src=rss",

Only our top pick (see below) got close to my router’s standard speeds, but I expected this.

    "summary": "Figuring out the best iPad for you can be tricky. Apple now sells three 11-inch tablets and two 13-inch ones, each with key differences in pricing, specs and accessory support. The iPad mini is still hanging around, too. Ahead of the big changes coming with the iPadOS 26 update later this year, we’ve tested each current iPad and broken down which ones best fit different needs, whether you want a laptop replacement or just a big screen for streaming.\nTable of contents\n\nThe best iPads for 2025\nHow we test the best iPads\niPad FAQs\nRecent updates\n\nThe best iPads for 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow we test the best iPads\n\n\n\n  The top edge of the iPad mini.\n \n\n  Photo by Nathan Ingraham / Engadget\n \n\nMuch like we do for our guide to the best tablets overall, we spend several days with each iPad to see how they feel and perform with different tasks: watching videos, web browsing, playing both casual and graphically intense games, editing 4K photos and video, running multiple apps side-by-side, making FaceTime calls and the like. To better measure performance specifically, we use benchmarking tests like Geekbench 6, 3DMark and GFXBench Metal, plus we measure how long it takes for each tablet to boot up and open various apps. We also check how well each tablet holds up long-term, whether it’s with a review unit provided by Apple or an iPad model that’s owned by a member of the Engadget staff. \nTo help compare the color performance and brightness of the displays, we play the same videos on different iPads, side-by-side, at equal brightness levels. We use each tablet in direct sunlight outdoors to see how well they hold up to glare, and we play a handful of the same musical tracks to evaluate speaker performance. For battery life, we keep track of how long each tablet generally lasts before it needs a recharge, but we also play a 1080p movie on a loop at roughly 70 percent brightness with power-sapping background processes off. We also test each device with an Apple Pencil and note how responsive the stylus feels. Finally, we carefully pore over spec sheets and software updates to keep track of which features are available on certain iPads but not others.\niPad FAQs\n\n\n\n  The iPad (A16) on top of an 13-inch iPad Air.\n \n\n  Jeff Dunn for Engadget\n \n\nWhat are some new features coming to iPadOS 26?\nApple first previewed iPadOS 26 during its WWDC keynote in June. The update looks to be a major overhaul, one that brings iPadOS closer to macOS than ever before. New features include the ability to open more windows simultaneously and resize or tile them more freely; a Mac-style Menu bar; a dedicated Preview app; an upgraded Files app; an improved ability to export or download large files in the background; an Exposé view that shows all open windows; a pointier cursor and the option to add folders to the Dock. It’ll also use the new “liquid glass” design language Apple is rolling out across all of its platforms in 2025. Importantly, Apple says these features will be available across its tablet lineup, from the iPad Pro to the entry-level iPad. That could make the latter a particularly enticing value. You can find the full list of compatible devices at the bottom of Apple’s press release.\nHow long do iPads typically last?\nIf history is any indication, expect Apple to update your iPad to the latest version of iPadOS for at least five years, if not longer. The current iPadOS 18 update, for example, is available on iPad Pro models dating back to 2018 and other iPads dating back to 2019. How long your iPad’s hardware will last depends on which model you buy and how well you maintain it. (If you’re particularly clumsy, consider an iPad case.) A more powerful iPad Pro will feel fast for a longer time than an entry-level iPad, but each model should remain at least serviceable until Apple stops updating it, at minimum.\nWhat’s the difference between the iPad and the iPad Air?\nCompared to the 11th-gen iPad, the iPad Air runs on a stronger M3 chip (instead of the A16 Bionic) and has 2GB more RAM (8GB total). Both come with 128GB of storage by default. The Air is also available in two sizes, 11 and 13 inches, whereas the 11th-gen iPad doesn't offer the larger screen option. The M-series SoC gives the Air better long-term performance, plus access to certain iPadOS features such as Apple Intelligence and Stage Manager. Its display supports a wider P3 color gamut, has an antireflective coating and is fully laminated. The latter means there’s no “air gap” between the display and the glass covering it, so it feels more like you’re directly touching what’s on screen instead of interacting with an image below the glass. The Air also works with the newer Pencil Pro stylus and more comfortable Magic Keyboards, and its USB-C port supports faster data transfer speeds. It technically supports faster Wi-Fi 6E, too, while the lower-cost iPad uses Wi-Fi 6.  \nStarting at $349, the 11th-gen iPad is $250 less expensive than the iPad Air. It has a similarly elegant design with flat edges, thin bezels, USB-C port, and a Touch ID reader. Battery life is rated at the same 10 hours, and both devices have their front-facing camera on their long edge, which is a more natural position for video calls. The cheaper iPad works with the first-gen and USB-C Apple Pencils – which are more convoluted to charge – and a unique keyboard accessory called the Magic Keyboard Folio.\n\n\n\n\n  Jeff Dunn for Engadget\n \n\nWhat’s the difference between iPads and Android tablets?\nThe operating system, duh. But to give a few more specifics: Android devices are available from more manufacturers and cover a wider price range. You won’t see an $80 iPad anytime soon. Android is also more malleable in that you can easily sideload apps from places beyond Google’s official app store and more extensively customize the look of the OS. Several Android tablets still have features like a headphone jack or a microSD slot for adding storage, too, though those are getting rarer.\nBut we tend to recommend Apple tablets to those who have no allegiance either way. iPad apps are still a bit more likely to be designed specifically for larger screens, rather than looking like blown-up phone software, and Apple is just about peerless when it comes to long-term software support. Every new iPad hits a certain baseline of hardware quality and performance — none of them feel cheap, and all of them are fast enough for most needs. Plus, you’ll get the most out of an iPad if you use other Apple devices.\nCan an iPad replace a laptop?\nThis is a loaded question, since laptop workflows differ from person to person. If you mostly use a notebook for browsing the web, watching videos or writing emails and word docs, then sure, you can get along just fine with an iPad and the right iPad accessories. It’ll be easier to carry around, the battery life is great and having the touchscreen and stylus support is handy (though many Windows users have that regardless). Even beyond the basics, plenty of media editors, graphic designers and digital artists have shown they can get things done on an iPad.\nBroadly speaking, though, a laptop OS tends to be more flexible when it comes to file management, multitasking, coding or other “heavy” tasks. Safari on the iPad isn’t quite on par with desktop browsers either. So the answer really depends on you. That said, the iPadOS 26 update could close the gap, so check back on this in a couple of months.\nHow do I take a screenshot on an iPad?\nAs we note in our screenshot how-to guide, you can take a screenshot on your iPad by pressing the top button and either volume button at the same time. If you have an older iPad with a Home button, simultaneously press the top button and the Home button instead.\nRecent updates\nAugust 2025: We've taken another sweep to ensure our picks are still accurate and added a few more notes to our FAQ section.\nJune 2025: We’ve made a few minor edits to reflect the announcement of Apple’s latest iPadOS update, which we detail above.\nMay 2025: We’ve lightly edited this guide to ensure all details and links are still correct. We’re also keeping an eye on how the Trump administration’s tariff policy affects the pricing and stock of the iPad lineup (and every other tech category). All of our picks are still available at normal prices today, but we’ll update this guide if that changes.\nMarch 2025: We've reviewed the iPad (A16) and named it our new budget pick, removing the discontinued 10th-gen iPad in the process. \nMarch 2025: The recently-launched iPad Air M3 has replaced its predecessor as our top overall recommendation. We’ve also made a note regarding the new iPad (A16), which we plan to test in the near future and expect to become our new budget pick.

Those looking to use the iPad Pro as a (very expensive) media consumption device don’t need this, but if you work with memory-hungry apps or need the absolute best, just note it’ll cost you. It’s the only one with a Thunderbolt USB-C port, which is technically faster for transferring large files. Finally, we carefully pore over spec sheets and software updates to keep track of which features are available on certain iPads but not others. It’ll also use the new “liquid glass” design language Apple is rolling out across all of its platforms in 2025. Its display supports a wider P3 color gamut, has an antireflective coating and is fully laminated. May 2025: We’ve lightly edited this guide to ensure all details and links are still correct. All of our picks are still available at normal prices today, but we’ll update this guide if that changes. March 2025: The recently-launched iPad Air M3 has replaced its predecessor as our top overall recommendation."

    "summary": "Apple on Tuesday finally announced that its iPhone 17 event will take place on Tuesday, September 9. So in just under two weeks, we'll get to take a first look at the new iPhone 17 lineup. If Apple keeps with tradition, expect to see iOS 26 available for download about one week after the event. If you can't wait any longer, you can download and install the newly released public beta 5 (or iOS 26 developer beta 8 for developers). I've been playing around with it for the past couple of weeks, and have found that taking screenshots is way better in the new operating system, as well as getting to choose how long you snooze. You can see a more complete view of the new features in our preview of the iOS 26 public beta release, which shows off the fresh home and lock screen redesign. Called Liquid Glass, the translucent look will extend across all of Apple's upcoming operating systems. The overhaul is one of several big changes coming to iOS, macOS, iPadOS and the rest of Apple's software suite, all of which were showcased during the company's WWDC keynote on June 9.\nAfter overpromising on AI plans last year, Apple kept its iOS roadmap focused more on basic quality of life improvements this year. There are multiple useful additions coming to the Phone and Messages apps on your iPhone, for instance: Apple execs outlined the ability to weed out spam texts or other unknown senders and an option to hold your spot on a phone call when you've been waiting for a representative to pick up. Plus, a treasured feature that we took for granted is coming back (hint: it's in the Photos app).\nSiri, meanwhile, is in a holding pattern. Apple has previously specified that its smarter voice assistant — first promised at WWDC 2024 — is delayed until some point \"in the coming year,\" so you shouldn't expect any major changes in the current betas. But there are reports that Apple is aiming to give Siri a bigger brain transplant by basing it on third-party artificial intelligence models like OpenAI's ChatGPT or Anthropic's Claude, which could make 2026 a pivotal year. The company is also reportedly working on a 'stripped-down' AI chatbot to rival ChatGPT.\nWith each beta, it seems like additional new improvements are popping up, like this new AirPods gesture we're all curious about, and this FaceTime feature that'll freeze your video if it detects nudity. With the release of the iOS 26 developer beta 5, we saw more added features, like a new bouncy animation on the passcode screen and in the Control Center, MacRumors reports. Some or all of those changes will likely soon migrate into the separate public beta (see below). Most newer iPhone models are eligible to download iOS 26 (both the betas and final version). Want to see the full list of new features coming this fall? Read on. \nWhat is iOS 26?\nThe current iPhone operating system is iOS 18, and Apple is still actively updating it — version 18.6.1 was released to restore Apple Watch blood oxygen monitoring functionality for certain users in the US. More recently, Apple released 18.6.2 to address a vulnerability related to image processing. Apple has officially stopped signing iOS 18.6, MacRumors reports, which means it can no longer be installed on your iPhone due to a \"server-side software verification check.\" That's pretty normal when newer versions are available to download.\nBut don't expect to see iOS 19 soon — or ever. Instead, Apple is skipping the numbering ahead to iOS 26 next month. The company has decided to line up its iOS version numbers with a year-based system, similar to car model years. So while iOS and its sibling operating systems will be released in late 2025, they're all designated \"26\" to reflect the year ahead. \nIt's official, we're moving to iOS 26. (Apple)\nWhat is Liquid Glass design?\nLet's be honest. Out of everything announced at WWDC this year, the new Liquid Glass design was the star of the show. The iPhone's home and lock screens have looked pretty much the same year after year — the last exciting thing (in my opinion) was the option to add your own aesthetic to your home screen by customizing your apps and widgets. So seeing the home and lock screens' new facelift is refreshing.\nSo what exactly is Liquid Glass? Apple calls it a \"new translucent material\" since, well, the apps and widgets are clear. However, the screen can still adapt to dark and light modes, depending on surroundings. You'll also notice buttons with a new floating design in several apps, like Phone and Maps. They're designed to be less distracting than the current buttons, but are still easy to see. While the design overhaul has proven to be controversial since its announcement, some — including Engadget's own Devindra Hardawar — like the new direction, even if it's somewhat reminiscent of Microsoft's translucent Windows Vista Aero designs from nearly twenty years ago.\nThat said, as of the release of the iOS 26 beta 2, Apple has already incorporated some user feedback into the design, dialing back the transparency in at least some places. And while it will continue to evolve, Apple users won't be able to escape it: Liquid Glass was designed to make all of Apple's OSes more cohesive. Here's a look at how the translucent aesthetic will look with the new macOS Tahoe 26 on your desktop.\nWhat are the new and notable features of iOS 26?\niOS 26 has a laundry list of new features. Among the most worthwhile:\nPhone app redesign: You'll finally be able to scroll through contacts, recent calls and voicemail messages all on one screen. It also comes with a new feature called Hold Assist that'll notify you when an agent comes to the phone so you can avoid the elevator music and continue on with other tasks.\nLive Translation in Phone, FaceTime and Messages: iOS 26 is bringing the ability to have a conversation via phone call or text message with someone who speaks another language. Live Translation will translate your conversation in real time, which results in some stop-and-go interactions in the examples Apple shared during its presentation.\nPolls in group chats: Tired of sorting through what seems like hundreds of messages in your group chat? You and your friends will soon be able to create polls in group messages for deciding things like which brunch spot you're eating at or whose car you're taking on a road trip.\nFiltering unknown senders in Messages: If you haven't received spam texts about unpaid tolls or other citations, you're lucky. For those of us who have, those annoying messages will soon be filtered away in a separate folder.\nVisual Intelligence: Similar to a reverse Google image search, this new feature will allow you to search for anything that's on your iPhone screen. For instance, if you spot a pair of shoes someone is wearing in an Instagram photo, you can screenshot it and use Visual Intelligence to find those shoes (or similar ones) online.\nPhotos tabs are back: For anyone who's still frustrated with the Photos changes made last year, you'll be happy to know that your tabs are coming back. Library and Collections will have their own separate spaces so you don't have to scroll to infinity to find what you're looking for.\nFaceTime \"Communication Safety\" feature: A newer addition to iOS 26 appears to be the FaceTime \"Communication Safety\" feature that pauses communications if and when nudity is detected. The feature appears to be a child safety feature that uses on-device detection, thus obviating any cloud-based privacy issues. \nNew lock screen options: The iPhone lock screen gets more customizable in iOS 26, with a cooler clock, 3D wallpaper effects, more widgets and better focus mode options. \nApple's Hold Assist will be nifty for those pesky services that put you on hold for 10 or more minutes. (Apple)\nNew changes coming to iPadOS 26\nYour iPad isn't getting left behind when it comes to big updates. Here's what's coming this fall.\nMultitasking and real windowing: When you download the newest update, you'll be able to have multiple apps running on your screen at the same time. Once you open an app, it'll appear on your screen as normal but you'll be able to resize and move it across your screen to make room for other apps. This feature is optional so you can turn it off if you don't like it.\nVisual update: Along with the other new OSes, iPadOS 26 is coming with the Liquid Glass aesthetic. This new look will appear on the lock and home screens, as well as the drop-down menus.\nNew menu bar: When you swipe down on your screen, the new menu bar will appear with options like File, Edit, Windows and more. There's also a search option if you're looking for something specific.\nCheck out our first impressions of iPadOS 26. \nWhat about AirPods?\nAirPods are also getting updated with iOS 26. Here are some of the more notable functions.\nEnhanced audio recording: Apple calls this \"studio-quality\" audio recording, and with it, you'll notice more clarity while in noisy environments.\nCamera remote control: Using this, you can take a photo or start and stop video recording with just one press on your AirPods. When taking photos, you'll get a three-second countdown before your iPhone or iPad snaps the picture.\nLive translation feature: While not officially announced or confirmed, it appears that the long-rumored live translation for AirPods could be coming with iOS 26. The evidence comes from a system asset spotted in the in iOS 26 beta showing a gesture that's triggered by pressing both earbud stems at the same time. The photo also shows words in several different languages. \nHeart rate monitoring (rumored for now): Bloomberg's Mark Gurman believes Apple will introduce new AirPods Pro earbuds this year, which could have heart rate monitoring. It would work with Apple's Health app and other fitness apps that track heart rates.\nWhich iPhones will be able to upgrade to iOS 26?\nA few iPhone models that run the current version of iOS — iPhone XR, XS and XS Max — won't be compatible with the latest upgrade. But any iPhones released in 2019 or later will be eligible for the iOS 26 update.\n\niPhone SE (second generation or later)\niPhone 11\niPhone 11 Pro\niPhone 11 Pro Max\niPhone 12\niPhone 12 mini\niPhone 12 Pro\niPhone 12 Pro Max\niPhone 13\niPhone 13 mini\niPhone 13 Pro\niPhone 13 Pro Max\niPhone 14\niPhone 14 Plus\niPhone 14 Pro\niPhone 14 Pro Max\niPhone 15\niPhone 15 Plus\niPhone 15 Pro\niPhone 15 Pro Max\niPhone 16\niPhone 16 Plus\niPhone 16 Pro\niPhone 16 Pro Max\niPhone 16e\n\nNot listed here are the presumed new iPhone 17 models (or maybe iPhone 26?) that are all but certain to be announced and released in September. \nHow to install iOS 26 beta\nThe iOS 26 public beta is now available to download via the Apple Beta Software Program. If you're not already a member, you'll need to sign up to try out all the latest features. Just visit beta.apple.com and sign up with your phone number or email address. It's free.\nOnce you're in, you can install it by going to Settings > General > Software Update and selecting iOS 26 public beta. \nA word of caution: Don't sign up with your main iPhone unless you're OK with any risks that occur with using an OS that isn't finalized.\nWhen will the final version of iOS 26 be released?\niOS 26 will be released to the public this fall. It usually comes in September, within a week of the Apple iPhone event. Last year, it rolled out to iPhone users on September 16 — exactly one week after the iPhone 16 lineup was announced. Since the iPhone 17 event falls on September 9 this year, it's possible the downloads will hit our phones on September 16.\nIf you're more interested in the Apple Intelligence features coming, here's everything Apple revealed for iOS, macOS and more during WWDC. Also, check out how iOS 26 screenshots could be an intriguing preview of Apple's delayed Siri rework.\nUpdate, August 27: Added the official iPhone 17 event date, as well as the potential iOS 26 release.\nUpdate, August 25: Added a rumor about new AirPods Pro having heart rate monitoring.\nUpdate, August 22: Noted that Apple has officially stopped signing iOS 18.6.\nUpdate, August 20: Noted that iOS 26 public beta 4 and iOS 18.6.2 are now available to download.\nUpdate, August 18: Added details about a potential iOS 18.6 update.\nUpdate, August 15: Added to link to what to expect at the Apple iPhone event and details about what's available in the iOS 26 screenshots editor.\nUpdate, August 13: Added new AirPods detail spotted in the iOS 26 beta.\nUpdate, August 11: Noted that iOS 26 developer beta has hit beta 6. \nUpdate, August 8: Added new features coming with iPadOS 26 and AirPods.\nUpdate, August 6: Noted the release of iOS 26 beta 5 and the new bouncy feature on passcode screen and Control Center.\nUpdate, August 4: Noted that Apple is reportedly working on a ChatGPT rival.\nUpdate, August 1: Added quote from Tim Cook about iOS 26.\nUpdate, July 31: Noted that iOS 18.6 is now available. \nUpdate, July 24: Noted the iOS 26 public beta is now available.\nUpdate, July 3: Noted new FaceTime feature found in the developer beta.\nUpdate, June 30: Noted ongoing iOS 18 releases, and reports that Apple is considering additional external LLMs for Siri. \nUpdate, June 25: Noted changes added in iOS 26 beta 2. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/apple-ios-26-public-beta-5-is-live-here-are-all-the-new-iphone-features-coming-in-september-135749996.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "It's official: The Apple iPhone 17 event will take place on Tuesday, September 9 at 1PM ET. That means we'll finally get to take a look at the much-anticipated iPhone 17 lineup — which will come equipped with the latest iOS 26 features preinstalled — and any new features Apple reveals that day. But since we still have to wait a couple of weeks until the iPhone event, we can only speculate what the new devices will look like. As with most unreleased iPhones, rumors and leaks have trickled in about the hardware side ahead of the official introduction. Here's what we're expecting and what we can reasonably assume we'll get from Apple in September.\nWhat are the latest iPhone 17 rumors?\nAfter the announcement dropped yesterday for the official iPhone 17 event, MacRumors speculates the Apple logo says a lot about the new iPhones. Apple's logo \"hints at two rumored iPhone 17 Pro features.\" \nThe logo shows bright orange and dark blue colors, rumored to be two of the iPhone 17 Pro colors, so they could be onto something. They also noticed it looks like an infrared heat map, hinting at the vapor chamber cooling system.\nGet ready for an awe dropping #AppleEvent on Tuesday, September 9! pic.twitter.com/uAcYp2RLMM— Tim Cook (@tim_cook) August 26, 2025\n\nThese rumors haven't been confirmed by Apple and we won't know what the actual iPhone 17 models will look like until the iPhone event next month. \nHow much will the iPhone 17 cost?\nApple's announced plan to expand US-based manufacturing partners seems to give it at least some shielding from the steepest Trump administration tariffs that have already triggered price increases on everything from PlayStations to Switch consoles to high-end cameras to Sonos speakers. But given that President Trump's trade policies can change from week to week, and Apple's continuing reliance on Asia-based supply chains, price shocks remain an ongoing possibility. The bigger question is: Will Apple absorb any higher costs, or pass them on to consumers? \nIf prices do creep up, Apple may choose to pair it with an \"upgrade.\" Consider this recent rumor posted by MacRumors from a leaker known as \"Instant Digital,\" suggesting that the default storage of the iPhone 17 line may start at 256GB, doubling the current 128GB baseline. While that could be accompanied by a price increase of $50, Apple could at least pitch it as a \"better value.\" That said, the company doubled the default RAM of its Mac computers from 8GB to 16GB at no extra cost in 2024 — but that was before the current Trump tariff cycle started.\nWhen will the iPhone 17 series be announced?\nMost years, the flagship smartphones are introduced in September. MacRumors highlighted a story originally reported by iphone-ticker.de that the Apple iPhone 17 event could be Tuesday, September 9, according to information gleaned from German mobile phone providers.\nIt's still too early to have the specific dates; some years, Apple only gives a week or two of lead time between sending invites and hosting the event. But years of past precedent show that sometime in September should be when the 17 models make their debut. This family of smartphones may be the last to follow that trend, however. There have been hints that the introduction of the iPhone 18 collection in 2026 will be split into a pro-tier announcement in the fall and a standard model announcement the following spring.\nWhat will the new iPhone 17 lineup include?\nDesign leaks suggest that Apple is building an ultra-thin smartphone, likely to be named the iPhone 17 Air to match Apple's ultralight laptop designation. Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, often a solid source of advanced intel about Apple, reported in January that the iPhone 17 Air will be equipped with a basic A19 chip and will only have a single camera lens. It may also use Apple's new in-house modem, which was introduced in February on the iPhone 16e. More details about this development may leak ahead of September, but that's what we know for now.\nAn investor note from Apple analyst Jeff Pu indicated that the Air will have a titanium frame. If his reports are accurate, the lightweight smartphone will be the only entry in the iPhone 17 lineup to use that metal; the iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone 17 Pro Max are expected to be made of aluminum, which is oddly a lighter material than titanium. Other speculation had suggested that the Air would use a blend of aluminum and titanium, so the exact materials may not be known until the official announcement.\nAdditionally, an August 4 MacRumors report says the internal battery pack of the iPhone Air is just 2.49mm thick — half the thickness of the iPhone 17 Pro battery. The leak was posted on the Korean-language Naver blog, where they show the alleged batteries of the iPhone 17 Air and 17 Pro side by side. The same account claimed the 17 Air's battery capacity was a mere 2,800 mAh, MacRumors notes. (That's below the battery capacity of current iPhone 16 models.)\nOn a similar topic, an iPhone 17 Pro production leak appears to have revealed an all-aluminum chassis, according to MacRumors. Originally posted by leaker Majin Bu, the image shows a shell that has a large round hole on the back (where the Apple logo typically is) to allow for MagSafe charging. MacRumors says this could just be a molding but notes that the aluminum frame (versus the current titanium in Pro iPhone models) would yield a significantly lower weight.\nThat same leaker (Majin Bu), whom MacRumors classifies as a \"hit-or-miss leaker,\" suggests the iPhone 17 Pro will have better wireless signal strength thanks to an updated antenna design. The individual posted a render on X that shows a new antenna system that wraps around the iPhone 17 Pro's supposedly wider rear camera bump. Again, this is a render, not a real-world photo. That said, we can't knock the goal of better wireless reception, so we're hoping this one has a degree of truth to it.\nLeaker Majin Bu also claims \"TechWoven\" cases could be introduced, per a MacRumors report. The cases match the rumored design on the iPhone 17 models, with the wide camera bump. The leaker noted there are two lanyard holes for \"convenient and secure carrying,\" so it could be worn around your neck. The colors would come in grey/black, blue, green, purple and orange. Additionally, he says there will be new Liquid Silicone cases in eight colors, including Deep Orange, Pale Orange, Grass Green, Celadon, Fog Purple, Grey Blue, Dark Blue and Midnight Black. \nEach new roster includes a base model, but over the years, Apple has shaken up the variety of phones it offers. Most likely there will be an iPhone 17 and an iPhone 17 Pro. Apple has also committed to the size matters philosophy, and has been building an iPhone Pro Max option with an even bigger screen and better battery life; the 17 roster will almost certainly have one as well. \nThe new Pro iPhones are said to have a full-width \"camera island\" on the rear, which would mark the first time an Apple model opted for that design. This feature can be seen in the purported iPhone 17 \"spotted in the wild.\" The pics, highlighted on MacRumors, show a black cased iPhone (17 Pro?) with the distinct back panel. Is it the real deal? The dual angles lend a degree of credibility in a social media landscape increasingly polluted with AI-enhanced fakes, but your guess is as good as ours.\nI just spotted a test development iPhone in the wild 🤩🤩🤩 pic.twitter.com/iS3PtKWqxJ— Fox Pupy 🦊🧡 (@Skyfops) July 28, 2025\n\nThe iPhone 17 Air seems primed to take the place of a potential iPhone 17 Plus. Since the iPhone 16e was only just introduced in February at a surprisingly high price point, it seems unlikely that there will be a new addition to that lower end of the spectrum, the models that were previously called SE. \nAt the very least, it sounds like the iPhone 17 Air won't take away the charging port and rely only on wireless connectivity. Bloomberg said that while Apple had investigated making the iPhone 17 Air without a single port, the company (fortunately) changed plans. He also says that the rumored phone will have a 6.6-inch screen and include the Dynamic Island and Camera Control button. Finally, the price is rumored at $900 — likely more than the standard iPhone 17 but less than the Pro.\nWe've also gotten what seems to be a reliable look at what the color lineup will be for the new smartphones. Macworld reported that the iPhone 17 will be available in black, white, steel gray, green, purple and light blue. The iPhone 17 Air will reportedly have four color options: black, white, light blue and light gold. While the Air colors will be less saturated, the visuals for the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max will go bold. The options for the Pro models are expected to be black, white, gray, dark blue and orange.\nBloomberg's Mark Gurman believes there actually will be a new orange color offered for the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max, as well as a light blue color for the iPhone 17 Air, he confirmed in his weekly Power On newsletter.\nOn July 30, Tom's Guide highlighted an X post from Sonny Dickson — a longtime and generally reliable leaker of unreleased iPhone information — showing \"dummy\" iPhone 17 models in the new colors that were the source of the aforementioned Macworld story. While these are literally just mock-ups — not real, leaked iPhones — it's interesting to see how the design and color rumors translate into a real-world look and feel.\nTo add the the rumors, a Weibo leaker known as Digital Chat Station suggests the iPhone 17e will come equipped with a new design that includes the Dynamic Island, MacRumors reports. According to the post, the new phone will have the A19 chip and could have a 6.1-inch OLED display with a front-facing 12-megapixel camera and a rear-facing 48-megapixel camera. However, it's important to note this report refers to the 17e model that would be expected to launch no earlier than February 2026, if it followed the same release pattern as the iPhone 16e.\nWhat will iOS 26 be like?\nApple upended its numbering conventions with WWDC 2025, and will match the name of each new operating system to the year it's released. So when the next wave of iPhones hits, they'll be running on iOS 26.\nOn the design side, the smartphone OS introduced during the big developer showcase took a contentious approach dubbed Liquid Glass. Apple has been scaling down the amount of transparency effects in the subsequent beta tests of iOS 26, but it will still have a glass-like visual.\nThe feature list includes big and small updates. On the more impactful side, the Phone and Photos apps have been redesigned. There will be several features leveraging artificial intelligence, such as live translation capabilities coming to Phone, FaceTime and Messages. Apple is also currently testing a sensitive content warning for child accounts that will freeze FaceTime video if nudity is detected by on-device machine learning tools. And the company is also launching Visual Intelligence, which will use AI to search for elements in an image.\niOS 26 also has a litany of minor, quality of life improvements. Group texts are getting support for polls. And for the slow risers out there, iOS 26 will finally let you escape the tyranny of the nine minute snooze alarm. \nThe next iOS is now available as a public beta. Here are our initial impressions of the Liquid Glass design and other new features. iOS 26 is compatible with all models back through iPhone 11.\nWhat other products are expected to be released alongside the iPhone 17?\nIf Apple follows its usual pattern, the iPhone 17 will be announced alongside new Apple Watch products. That would be the Apple Watch Series 11 (if Apple sticks to the same naming scheme), and maybe an Apple Watch Ultra 3 and/or an updated Apple Watch SE. (They'll all run watchOS 26, of course.) Other possibilities — and this is, again, speculation — could include refreshed Apple AirPods Pro (which received its last big update in 2022) and maybe new AirTags trackers (first released in 2021).\nThe Apple rumor mill got a big shot in the arm this week thanks to the reported inclusion of product ID numbers in recent beta software builds. Per MacRumors, it's a laundry list of new hardware, including long-rumored product updates like the Apple TV, HomePod mini, new Apple Studio Display monitor and two fresh iPads. \nOf course, even if that list is totally accurate, we may not see those products until 2026 — if ever. So don't expect all of products to share the stage with the iPhone 17, especially since Apple likes to keep its star performer at the center of attention. \nThat said, keep in mind that Apple has recently been having Mac-centric announcements in late October (as it did last year to debut new M4 Macs), so there's always the chance of another shoe dropping a few weeks down the road.  \nUpdate, August 27, 2025, 5:44PM ET: Added official Apple iPhone 17 event date, and a rumor about its event logo.\nUpdate, August 25, 2025, 5:15PM ET: Added new reports about the iPhone 17 Pro's orange color as well as new rumored Liquid Silicone cases.\nUpdate, August 22, 2025, 11:52AM ET: Added new details about the colors of the rumored TechWoven case.\nUpdate, August 20, 2025, 7:12PM ET: Added new rumor about potential TechWoven case for iPhone 17 series.\nUpdate, August 18, 2025, 6:23PM ET: Added new rumor about the iPhone 17e potentially having the Dynamic Island.\nUpdate, August 15, 2025, 2:05PM ET: Added new rumor about the all-aluminum chassis on the iPhone 17.\nUpdate, August 13, 2025, 10:02PM ET: Added a list of the products that are expected to be released alongside the iPhone 17s. \nUpdate, August 11, 2025, 7:27PM ET: Added a render of a rumored new antenna design for the iPhone 17 Pro.\nUpdate, August 8, 2025, 4:43PM ET: Added new speculation and reports about iPhone 17 pricing.\nUpdate, August 6, 2025, 4:05PM ET: Added latest details about the potential iPhone 17 event date.\nUpdate, August 4, 2025, 5:23PM ET: Added latest battery leaks about the iPhone 17 models.\nUpdate, August 1, 2025, 8:15AM ET: Added new photos showing potential iPhone 17 colors.\nUpdate, July 30, 2025, 11:08AM ET: Added latest leaks and rumors about the iPhone 17, and updated information on the iOS 26 public beta.\nUpdate, July 17, 2025, 4:40PM ET: Added latest information about iOS 26, possible materials for the Air, and the color options for the different models.\nUpdate, March 17, 2025, 2PM ET: Added details about the rumored price and features of the iPhone 17 Air.\nUpdate, April 11, 2025, 3:45PM ET: Added details from Front Page Tech's new video that claims to reveal details from a leaked iOS 19 build.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/the-iphone-17-event-is-september-9-heres-everything-to-know-about-the-upcoming-apple-lineup-153024127.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Choosing the best Android phone can feel overwhelming as there are so many options from so many brands, it’s hard to know where to start. Unlike Apple, which sticks to its sleek lineup of iPhones, Android offers a world of variety. Whether you're eyeing the latest flagship from Samsung, a budget-friendly smartphone from Motorola or something unique with a foldable design, there’s an Android device out there to suit your needs.The beauty of Android is its flexibility. You’ll find phones with different screen sizes, camera setups, battery life and even quirky extras like stylus support or rugged builds. Plus, Android lets you customize your device to your heart's content – something Apple fans might envy. We’ve tested and researched the top Android phones to help you find the right one for your budget, lifestyle, and tech preferences.\nBest Android phones for 2025\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhat to look for in a new Android phone\nPerformance\nWhen it comes to picking our favorite Android phones, the main things we look for are pretty straightforward: good performance (both compute and AI), a nice display, solid design, sharp cameras, long battery life and a significant commitment to ongoing software support. For performance, not only do we look at benchmarks and other metrics, but we also evaluate phones based on responsiveness. Regardless of whether you’re reading, text messaging, scrolling through social media or playing a game, no one wants a gadget that feels sluggish. \nDisplay\n\n\n\n\nWhen it comes to displays, we generally prefer OLED panels that can produce rich, saturated colors with at least 600 nits of brightness, though many of our top mid-range and high-end phones can hit 1,000 nits or more. And more recently, most of our favorite devices also support screens with fast refresh rates of 90Hz or 120Hz, which adds an extra level of smoothness and fluidity.\nDesign\nNow we will admit there is a bit of subjectivity when deciding which phones look the best, but there are other design aspects like dust and water resistance or screen durability that can make a big difference to long-term survival. It’s also important to consider things like support for wireless charging, power sharing (aka reverse wireless charging) and UWB connectivity, which can have an impact on how your phone interacts with your other devices.\nCameras\nObviously, for photos we’re looking for sharp, colorful shots in both bright and low-light conditions. And we want video clips with high dynamic range, rich audio and smooth image stabilization. Extra cameras for ultra-wide and telephoto lenses are a plus. The best cameras should also include features like dedicated night modes, support for various video recording resolutions, and additional photo modes like timelapse, slow motion and more.\nBattery and software\nFinally, in terms of longevity, we’re looking for all-day battery life on devices that also delivered great results on our local video rundown test (at least 16 hours on a charge, but more is obviously better). Wireless charging capabilities have become almost ubiquitous over the past few years, and most of our top picks have this extra perk. Fast-charging is available on some Android phones, too. Finally, with people holding onto their phones longer than ever, we like to see companies commit to at least three years of software support, upgrades and regular security updates.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/best-android-phone-130030805.html?src=rss",

Sam Rutherford for Engadget 91 100 Expert Score Best budget Android phone Google Pixel 9a Read our full Google Pixel 9a review Processor: Google Tensor G4 | Display: 6.3-inch 1,080 x 2,424 pOLED, up to 120Hz | Cameras: Rear array (48MP wide, 13MP ultrawide), 13MP front camera | Battery: 5,100mAh The Pixel 9a isn't especially flashy and it doesn't have any special features that aren't already available on its more expensive siblings. So while it's not super fancy, the phone has all of its most important bases covered (and then some). Sam Rutherford for Engadget 88 100 Expert Score Best foldable Android phone Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 Read our full Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 review Processor: Snapdragon 8 Elite | Display: 8-inch 2184 x 1968QXGA+ Dynamic AMOLED 2X full display, 6.5-inch 2520 x 1080FHD+ Dynamic AMOLED 2X cover display | Cameras: Rear array (200MP wide, 12MP ultrawide, 10MP telephoto), 10MP front camera | Battery: 4,400mAh One of the biggest issues with foldable phones is the added size and weight that often comes with the inclusion of a flexible display. It sports a 6.8-inch OLED display with an incredible peak brightness of up to 4,500 nits. But the best part is that starting at $900, it costs less than an equivalent Galaxy S25+ too. Now we will admit there is a bit of subjectivity when deciding which phones look the best, but there are other design aspects like dust and water resistance or screen durability that can make a big difference to long-term survival. It’s also important to consider things like support for wireless charging, power sharing (aka reverse wireless charging) and UWB connectivity, which can have an impact on how your phone interacts with your other devices."

    "summary": "Google marked the tenth generation of Pixels with four new smartphones. While the ‘pro’ and foldable Pixel 10 models might have no-compromise specs (and prices to match), Google has blurred the lines between its entry-level Pixel 10 and those premium devices. This year, the base Pixel 10 has a bigger battery, a new 5x zoom telephoto camera and almost as many AI features as the flagship Pixel 10 Pro and Pixel 10 Pro Fold.\nIf the celebrity-loaded Made By Google event was anything to go by, the company is putting a lot more effort (and money) into making the Pixel a genuine threat to the Galaxy S series and iPhones, and conveying that message to everyone. The Pixel 10 deserves those comparisons, and in a lot of ways, it’s the better smartphone. \n \nHardware and display\nGoogle’s 10th-generation of Pixels look a lot like their predecessors. There’s a protruding pill-shaped camera unit, which is the central design flourish. It’s substantial, which still looks a little jarring, but it also doubles as a sort of grip for my index finger while holding the phone, something I noticed after a year of using the Pixel 9 Pro. Google has also refreshed the color range of its Pixel family. Both a vivid blue (Indigo) and mild yellow (Lemongrass) shades are welcome additions to the typical black and white hues.\nThe 6.3-inch screen’s refresh rate still tops out at 120Hz, but that’s now pretty much standard across midrange devices and up. Even the entry-level Pixel 9a has the same smooth scrolling experience. However, Google has boosted the Pixel 10’s brightness, now peaking at 3,000 nits, which is a slight increase from 2,700 nits on the Pixel 9. The screen maxes out at 2,000 nits at its brightest setting for HDR, which is also a bump up from the Pixel 9. Google has also boosted the sound quality on the Pixel 10 to be noticeably less tinny and a little bassier than previous Pixels.\nAnother addition is Pixelsnap, which is essentially MagSafe for Pixels. The wireless charging integration is largely the same, with magnets that firmly attach the device to charging pucks, accessories and docks. It easily worked with a range of wireless chargers, although Qi2-supported options are still rarer than they should be. You’re more likely to find a MagSafe-branded wireless charger from third-party companies like Belkin, but those don’t achieve the faster charge speeds of Qi2.\nIf you’re feeling spendy, Google’s official Pixelsnap charger is $40 (or $70 with a stand) and reaches speeds up to 25W, while there’s a PopSocket-like Pixel ring stand that can snap to the back of the phone. Note that the Pixel 10 can only wirelessly charge up to 15W, though. Additionally, the Pixel 10 series supports most of the MagSafe peripherals that iPhone users have been enjoying since 2020.\nCamera\n\n\n\n\nThe big hardware upgrade this year is the cameras. The photo unit includes a 48-megapixel wide-angle setup, a 13MP sensor with an ultra-wide lens and a 10.8MP 5x telephoto camera. For a base phone, it’s an impressive combo, even though it doesn’t quite match the higher-res sensors found in the Pixel 10 Pro — or last year’s Pixel 9 Pro.\n\n\n\n\nThat new telephoto lens isn’t some middling 2x or 3x zoom, but a 5x zoom which puts it beyond rivals at a similar price point, like the Galaxy S25 (3x zoom). The iPhone 16 doesn't even have a telephoto lens and makes do with an \"optical-quality\" digital zoom. It’s like using a Pixel Pro, with an additional cropped zoom up to 10x and a (less consistent) Super Res Zoom up to 20x. This is a significant step up for the base model and something I’m sure we’ll see the aforementioned rivals likely try to match. Simply put, the Pixel 10 is just a better, more versatile camera phone than, say, the Galaxy S25.\n\n\n\n\nI tested the Pixel 10’s telephoto against the 9 Pro’s, and there were noticeable differences in detail and crispness, which is understandable as the latter has a much higher-res 48MP sensor. However, that doesn’t detract from the leap in both detail and shooting range compared to the base Pixel 9 from last year.\nThe Pixel 10 can also capture 10-bit HDR video now, although it doesn’t offer the Pixel 10 Pro’s 8K video, Night Sight Video and Super Res Zoom Video options. There’s no Video Boost, either, which uploads footage to Google’s cloud to enhance online.\n\n\n\n\nThere are plenty of other notable camera features onboard, including Night Sight low-light shooting, or Add Me, which is still the standout Pixel camera feature from last year and hasn’t been replicated by rivals yet. For those who missed my praise last year, Add Me stitches together two group photos, taken by two different people. The mode guides users to line up the shots, meaning your group photos can finally include the person who takes all of them (me).\nCamera Coach is an intriguing addition to the Pixel camera experience. Above the viewfinder, there’s a new camera icon with a plus sign in the top right corner. Tapping it makes the screen flash, and the coach will offer multiple framing and photo-taking suggestions. It’ll also add a Get Inspired option that goes a bit more avant-garde, generating thumbnails of possible results based off of the sample it took, filling the gaps with generative AI.\nI witheringly launched the Coach, ready to criticize its basic suggestions or common-sense ideas. But, you know what, it’s not bad. With hooks in Gemini AI, the mode will offer angle, lighting and composition suggestions. You can also choose whether to emphasize, say, the pattern of some leaves, or the background behind it or the group of people to the side. While the feature utilizes Google’s Tensor G5 chip to analyze shots, it does require an internet connection.\nSoftware\n\n\n\n\nThanks to the Tensor G5 chip, the Pixel 10 can run Google’s newest Gemini Nano model on-device. This means generative AI experiences can now be used without the need for connectivity. However, as I mentioned with Camera Coach, that isn’t always the case.\nHowever, Magic Cue does work without having to summon its answers from the cloud. And when it works, it’s what I’ve wanted from AI assistants for years. After gaining your permission, Gemini gets into your screenshots, calendar, Gmail accounts and more. Magic Cue will pull in the information you need, hopefully, where you need it. For example, it displays the email address for that comedy show venue your friend wants tickets for, or nudges your calendar to show availability when a friend asks what your weekend plans are. These cues are highlighted with a rainbow “aura” that has become the de facto visual shorthand for artificial intelligence. This is just the start: Google will eventually add the ability for Magic Cue to tap into your photos, suggesting images when someone’s mentioned in text messages, emails and more.\nMagic Cue has some blind spots, though. As my colleague Sam Rutherford noted in his Pixel 10 Pro review, I found it particularly fussy with calendar cues, often failing to identify dates or times in screenshots or emails. It’s also missing a major area of where I want all of this info: third-party messaging apps. But hey, if you’re using Google Messages, you’re good to go.\nGoogle’s almost-instantaneous voice translation during calls is impressive too. Managing Editor Cherlynn Low laid out how that works, and while it’s a technical marvel, I’m not sure how much I’d use the feature for high-stakes conversations like booking accommodations or sorting out travel issues.\nI also liked Take a Message, which transcribes calls when you’re unable to answer. However, just like I did while I was testing Apple’s similar feature during my iOS 26 preview, I either answered calls instinctively [Ed. note: Mat is clearly a different specimen from the rest of us humans] or people didn’t leave voicemails.\nThere are plenty of minor upgrades to existing tools and features on the Pixel 10. Gemini Live, which can “see” through your camera or read what’s on screen, can also now offer visual guidance, highlighting objects onscreen after hearing your request or question. NotebookLM now integrates with Pixel Screenshots and Recorder. If the former detects something that could be useful to an existing NotebookLM project, it’ll suggest adding it for easier access.\nThere are also Writing Tools (sound familiar?) within Gboard, which can retool your existing prose into specified writing styles. It’ll even suggest which emojis to add into the mix. For now, this is only compatible with US English, so it’s not my favourite favorite. There’s also a new Pixel Journal app, which sounds pretty familiar too. I briefly tested it out during the days I’ve had the phone, but if you haven’t found the app/notebook/diary to journal in yet, it’s a perfectly fine option, with AI-powered suggestions on what to write about and the ability to attach photos and other details that your smartphone can log. Something that wasn’t apparent during my review was that the Journal app will learn about your writing patterns and offer up insights on how often you write, when you typically write and more.\nPerformance and battery life\n\n\n\n\nGoogle says its new Tensor G5 chip is 34 percent faster than last year’s G4, while the TPU (Tensor Processing Unit, ugh) is 60 percent faster at AI tasks. Performance testing apps like Geekbench 6 can’t be installed on Pixel devices before the phones go on sale, so I wasn’t able to quantify the upgrade. I can feel those improvements with heavier processing tasks though, like transcription, translation and image generation, in apps like Pixel Studio. The Pixel 10 also had no issues running graphically intensive games like Infinity Nikki and Zenless Zone Zero, and seemed quicker to load most apps compared to Pixel phones of the past. Google’s Tensor chips are definitely catching up.\nAnecdotally, I find myself using Google’s Pixel AI features (and Gemini) significantly more often than on other Android devices I’ve used and tested. With comparable AI tasks, such as transcribing an interview, the Tensor G5 appears to handle them more efficiently, delivering results in less time.\nThe Pixel 10 has a 4,970mAh battery, which is not only bigger than the Pixel 9 (4,700mAh) but also the Pixel 10 Pro (4,870mAh). However, the Pixel 10 doesn’t quite match the 27 hours-plus rundown time of the Pixel 9. Running a looping video, this year’s phone lasted around 22 hours, which is a bit disappointing given the specs. I’ll retest and update this review if the results differ.\nThe Pixel 10 supports wired charging up to 30W, returning to over 50 percent in under 30 minutes. It can also be wirelessly charged at up to 15W, thanks to Qi2 support. That’s an improvement, but it’s not Qi2.2 like the Pixel 10 Pro XL, which can reach 25W charging wirelessly.\nWrap-up\n\n\n\n\nThe Pixel 10 redefines what we should expect from base flagship smartphones. With Apple’s next iPhone just around the corner, Google has added a 5x telephoto camera, rounding out the Pixel’s photography chops offering while augmenting it with more features powered by Gemini. Camera Coach might not be for everyone, but Magic Cue — like Pixel Screenshots last year — is a glimpse into the future of how we’ll use AI on smartphones.\nThe Pixel 10 is a substantial upgrade from the Pixel 9, although given it has the Tensor G5 chip, it’s a shame that software features like Zoom Enhance from last year’s Pixels didn’t make the cut. Unless you’re a die-hard smartphone gamer, there isn’t a more capable smartphone at this price.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/google-pixel-10-review-170041718.html?src=rss",
    "full_text": "While it doesn’t have cameras quite as powerful as the Pixel 10 Pro, it combines the utility of a long-range telephoto camera with an array of camera software tools that benefit both professional and novice smartphone photographers alike.
