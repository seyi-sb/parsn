    "summary": "The Nintendo Switch 2 is here, and that means a whole lot more people will eventually need a new microSD card. While the new console comes with 256GB of built-in storage — eight times more than the original Switch and four times more than the Switch OLED — its improved performance means that some games will chew up a ton of that space. Cyberpunk 2077 is a 59GB download, for example, while Split Fiction checks in at 69GB. Other titles aren’t nearly as big (particularly those made by Nintendo itself), but chances are you’ll want to add more room at some point down the road.\nWhenever that is, you’ll need a microSD Express card. This is not the same as the old reliable microSD cards you may have bought for the first Switch or other gaming handhelds — they’re newer, faster and far more expensive. But if you want more space, they’re your only choice. If you’re looking to grab one today, we’ve laid out the best microSD cards for the Switch 2 and broken down what you should know before you buy. \nThe best microSD cards for the Switch 2 (aren't all that important)\n\n\n\n\n  Jeff Dunn for Engadget\n \n\nThe Switch 2 is the first mainstream device to require microSD Express for storage expansion, so there aren’t many options available to buy just yet. Of the six compatible models we’ve seen thus far, we’ve tested five: the SanDisk microSD Express Card, the Lexar Play Pro, the Samsung microSD Card for Nintendo Switch 2, the PNY microSD Express Card and the GameStop Express microSD Card for Nintendo Switch 2. The first four are made by genuine storage manufacturers, while the GameStop card appears to be a rebadged version of another model. (This should be the case with another card sold by Walmart under its Onn sub-brand, which we hope to catch in stock before our next update.) We used the 256GB version of every card except for Lexar Play Pro, which was 1TB.\nAfter timing these microSD Express cards across a range of Switch 2 games, our advice is simple: Get whichever one is available for the lowest price in the capacity you want. They aren’t identical, especially if you want to move a game to the card from the console’s internal storage (or vice versa). But the differences in load times and overall performance within actual games are tough to notice unless you have a stopwatch handy.\nAll five cards loaded up the digital version of Mario Kart World, for instance, between 18 and 20 seconds. Each loaded the first Grand Prix race in about 6.5 seconds. Getting to the start screen of Cyberpunk 2077 took about 38 seconds in each case. Loading a save in a particularly asset-heavy area (Jig-Jig Street) then took between 26 and 29 seconds, depending on the card.\nWith Fast Fusion, a smaller native Switch 2 game, the initial load always took six to seven seconds, while each card loaded the first championship race in roughly 4 seconds. It was a similar situation with the Switch 2 upgrade for The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild (using a Switch 1 cartridge): Each card took just over six seconds to get to the start screen, between 19 and 20 seconds to load a save just before the final boss, about 16 seconds to fast travel between Kakariko Village and Korok Forest, and so on. We saw no significant issues with in-game loads when playing each game, either.\n\n\n\n  The SanDisk microSD Express Card and Lexar Play Pro.\n \n\n  Jeff Dunn for Engadget\n \n\nAll of this suggests that the Switch 2 has a relatively specific target for these cards to hit, and that there may not be much room for one model to leap too far out in front of the others. We’ll also note that the console’s built-in storage was consistently faster than any external option: The gap wasn’t always big, but no card truly outpaced it in any of our tests. Loading that demanding area in Cyberpunk, for example, took about 22.5 seconds on average. So if you want the absolute fastest load times, don’t put your game on a card at all.\nIf you need the mental comfort of knowing you technically have the best card available, get the SanDisk microSD Express Card. It had no outliers across our many game loading tests, and it was consistently right near the top when it came to moving games to and from system storage, which means it offers strong sequential read and write performance. Benchmark testing on PC with tools like CrystalDiskMark backed this up, as noted in our broader microSD card buying guide.\n\n\nPutting Mario Kart (a 21.9GB file) on that card took four minutes and 39 seconds on average, which was only second to the Lexar Play Pro by six seconds. It was the fastest to write Fast Fusion (3.5GB), taking an average of 27 seconds across three runs. Only PNY’s card was faster to move games back to the console’s storage, but that one was far slower at writing games to the card — getting Mario Kart on there took seven minutes and 11 seconds on average. Just note that the 128GB version of SanDisk’s card has slower sequential writes than the larger versions, including much slower sustained write speeds (100 MB/s vs 210-220 MB/s). So transferring a game to that particular model will take much longer.\nPractically speaking, though, speed differences aren’t as important in this case as having lots of space to hold games at a price you can live with. To make things easy, we’ve listed every Express card we’ve seen at retailers at the time of writing below. Remember: You want microSD Express, not “Extreme,” like the branding SanDisk uses for some conventional microSD cards. A microSD Express card will have a big “EX” logo printed on it.\n128GB\n\nSanDisk microSD Express Card ($60 MSRP)\nPNY microSD Express Card ($47 MSRP)\n\n256GB\n\nSamsung microSD Express Card for Nintendo Switch 2 ($60 MSRP)\nSanDisk microSD Express Card ($73 MSRP)\nLexar Play Pro ($60 MSRP)\nPNY microSD Express Card ($61 MSRP)\nGameStop Express microSD Card for Nintendo Switch 2 ($60 MSRP)\nOnn microSD Express Card ($36 MSRP)\n\n512GB\n\nSanDisk microSD Express Card ($125 MSRP)\nLexar Play Pro ($120 MSRP)\nGameStop Express microSD Card for Nintendo Switch 2 ($100 MSRP)\nOnn microSD Express Card ($66 MSRP)\n\n1TB\n\nLexar Play Pro ($220 MSRP)\nGameStop Express microSD Card for Nintendo Switch 2 ($190 MSRP)\n\n\n\n\n  All microSD Express cards will have this \"EX\" logo printed on them.\n \n\n  Nintendo/Engadget\n \n\nAs you can see, while the SanDisk card is fast, it’s also the most expensive of an already-pricey bunch. Is it worth an extra $10-20 to shave a couple seconds off certain loads in certain games, or a couple minutes when moving a game to external storage? Probably not for most people.\nBut stock for all of these cards has been patchy since the Switch 2 landed, especially for the Walmart Onn model, which is by far the cheapest choice. If only one card is actually available by the time you read this — and you must have it today — it’s safe to just get it. You won’t lose or gain all that much when it comes to real-world performance.\nUltimately, though, we advise holding off on buying any microSD Express card for as long as possible. President Trump’s tariff shenanigans could spike prices a little higher in the short term, but in general, all of these cards are about as expensive today as they’ll ever be. And compared to traditional microSD options, they are pricey: The Samsung Pro Plus, for example, costs $17 for 128GB, $25 for 256GB, $43 for 512GB and $90 for 1TB as of this writing.\nThe Switch 2 is extremely popular, so more microSD Express cards will need to be made and prices will (eventually) come down. Ideally, we’ll see more high-capacity options as well: Nintendo says the Switch 2 technically supports cards up to 2TB, but so far only a couple even go up to 1TB. All of this means you should try to use all 256GB baked into the Switch 2 first, even if it means having to delete a game or two. But if you absolutely need more space right away, the cards above should be fine.\nWhat are microSD Express cards?\n\n\n\n  A microSD Express card like the one on the right has a second row of pins on the back.\n \n\n  Jeff Dunn for Engadget\n \n\nMost microSD cards are based on a standard called Ultra High Speed (UHS), of which there are three versions: UHS-I, UHS-II and UHS-III. The vast majority of cards you may have bought in the past utilize UHS-I. These have one row of pins in the back and a theoretical maximum data transfer speed of 104 megabytes per second (MB/s). (Though many cards are able to surpass that limit with proprietary tech and card readers.) The original Switch has a UHS-I microSD slot, as do most other gaming handhelds like Valve’s Steam Deck.\nUHS-II cards add a second row of pins and can reach up to 312 MB/s. These are pricier and much less common than cards based on UHS-I, but they’re supported by some cameras and higher-power handhelds like the ASUS ROG Ally X. UHS-III, meanwhile, is twice as fast as UHS-II in theory (624 MB/s), but no microSD cards have actually used it.\nUHS-I cards have held on over the years because they’re cheap, widely supported and fast enough for the things most people need them to do: record 4K video, stash photos and so on. But with the Switch 2, Nintendo needs more. The new console is dramatically more powerful, which allows it to run demanding games that may have originally been built for stronger hardware like the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X or gaming PCs. The device also uses UFS 3.1 storage internally, which is much speedier than the eMMC storage used by the original Switch. (A custom file decompression engine helps improve load times as well.) So if the Switch 2 is going to accept microSD cards, it needs ones that won’t bring a serious drop-off in performance and can hold up with modern games.\n\n\n\n  The Nintendo Switch 2.\n \n\n  Sam Rutherford for Engadget\n \n\nHence, SD Express. This standard has technically been around since 2018 but mostly went nowhere until the Switch 2 came along. It also uses a second row of pins, but it lets microSD cards take advantage of the PCI Express (PCIe)/NVMe interface, which is the same underlying tech used by modern SSDs. As a result, it can produce considerably faster read and write speeds, with a current theoretical maximum of 985 MB/s.\nAs noted above, real-world performance won’t be quite that fast. Even if it was, the best microSD Express cards would still be much slower than the NVMe SSDs used by the PS5 and Xbox. (Sony recommends SSDs with sequential read speeds of at least 5,500 MB/s.) And they’ll fall well below their peak speeds under sustained loads: SanDisk, for instance, says sustained write speeds for its 128GB Express card can drop as low as 100 MB/s.\nBut they’re still a marked improvement over old UHS-I cards, and in theory, they should be quicker than some older SATA-based SSDs when it comes loading game levels, asset streaming, retrieving saves or copying games to external storage. Whereas SanDisk’s microSD Express card can produce sequential read speeds around 900 MB/s, Lexar’s Professional Silver Plus — the top UHS-I pick in our general microSD card guide — topped out just over 200 MB/s, and that’s with a proprietary reader. (On the first Switch, it’d be closer to 100 MB/s.) Sequential writes and random speeds were three to four times better as well, and sometimes even more depending on the benchmark we used.\nIt remains to be seen how well these Express cards will hold up with years of use, and there’s no way to know exactly when their sky-high prices will drop. Non-Switch 2 devices that support microSD Express are still exceedingly rare, and the standard itself isn’t backwards compatible with UHS-II, so you’ll be limited to UHS-I speeds if you want to use your card with another device (unless you buy a pricey external reader). Still, while the increased costs and limited selection are annoying, the tech itself is worthy of a next-gen Switch.\nHow we test microSD Express cards\n\n\n\n\n  Jeff Dunn for Engadget\n \n\nWe put our microSD Express cards through a series of tests meant to simulate how people would use each card on the Switch 2 in the real world. We mainly worked with four games: a mid-sized title in Mario Kart World, a small one in Fast Fusion, a relatively large one in Cyberpunk 2077 and a hybrid in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, which ran off a Switch 1 cartridge but used a roughly 10GB Switch 2 upgrade pack that was downloaded and installed digitally.\nWe first timed how long it took to move each game from the system’s internal storage to the card in question, and vice versa. We then timed how long it took to load each game when installed to a given card. After that, we measured how quickly the cards could load certain in-game scenarios: the first Grand Prix race in Mario Kart; the first championship race in Fast Fusion; fast traveling between the Jig-Jig Street, Embers and Downtown Central areas in Cyberpunk and fast traveling between the Kakariko Village, Korok Forest and the Hyrule Castle Town Ruins areas in Zelda. (We chose those places in the latter two games because they’re more taxing than other regions.) With Cyberpunk and Zelda, we also timed how long it took to load up different save files in those locations.\nWith each test, we completed three to five runs to account for any irregularities and marked down the average time taken between them. We did each test in airplane mode, with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth off, to minimize any performance drain that could arise from background downloads. Between each test, we also spent at least an hour playing the games off each card to ensure there were no significant drop-offs compared to the console’s built-in storage.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/best-microsd-cards-for-nintendo-switch-2-160052947.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Choosing the best laptop can be a bit of a challenge — there are so many models, sizes and specs out there that it’s easy to feel lost in the shuffle. But the good news is that modern laptops are better than ever. Whether you're looking for a powerful AI PC, a travel-ready ultrabook or an affordable machine that can handle everyday tasks, there's something out there for everyone. Today’s systems combine improved performance, longer battery life and smarter features in sleek, lightweight designs that are built to keep up with work, play and everything in between.Out of all of the notebooks we've tested and reviewed recently, we consider Apple's 13-inch MacBook Air M4 to be the best laptop for most people, and this is still the case for our top picks to start off the new year. It's powerful enough to handle most tasks (even light video editing); it has a great screen and built-in speakers; and its battery could last over 18hours (depending on what you're doing, of course). The MacBook Air M4 is also one of the lightest and thinnest systems we've reviewed, and it's dead silent, thanks to a fanless design.Of course, not everyone wants a MacBook, and there are excellent Windows laptops and Chromebooks out there, too. Windows systems offer a range of configurations, from budget to high-end UHD screens with stunning IPS panels that boast high nits for vivid brightness. Chromebooks, on the other hand, tend to be more affordable and are great for users who mostly work online. Whether you need a powerhouse for creative work, a compact system for note-taking, or a laptop that can handle family movie night, there’s something for everyone in today’s laptop market.\nTable of contents\n\nBest laptops of 2025\nHow we test and pick laptops\nFactors to consider when choosing a laptop\nOther laptops we’ve tested\nLaptop FAQs\nRecent updates\n\nBest laptops of 2025\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBack to top \nHow we test laptops\nEngadget has been reviewing laptops for two decades, and while the definition of what a portable PC is has changed considerably since, our obsession with testing their limits and serving up informative buying advice remains the same. Be it a hybrid tablet like Microsoft's Surface machines, a rotating 2-in-1 convertible like HP's Spectre x360s or a plain old clamshell notebook, our review process follows similar beats. How does it look and feel? How fast is it? Whether it’s a Windows device powered by an Intel Core i5 or higher, a MacBook or a Chromebook, we aim to answer the most important question: Is it actually worth your hard-earned cash? We also pay close attention to portability, webcam quality and display features, including IPS panels and nits of brightness, as they can make a big difference in daily use.\nBack to top\nFactors to consider when choosing a laptop\nOperating system: Apple, Windows or Chrome OS\nThere's a good chance you've already committed to an operating system, but my advice is to be as flexible as possible. These days, most major software is compatible with both Macs and PCs. (Of course, it's another story if you've become dependent on an Apple-only app like Final Cut Pro.) Web-based apps, naturally, will work on any platform with an internet browser.\nIf you're an Apple-loyalist, there aren't many reasons to consider Windows laptops (unless you want a secondary gaming machine). But for Windows users, macOS is becoming more tempting every year. Apple's MacBooks, powered by its M-series Silicon chips, are among the fastest and most efficient laptops we've ever seen. They're incredibly well-built and have outstanding battery life to boot. MacOS itself is also an easy platform to learn, especially if you're used to iOS and iPadOS.\nThat brings up another point: iPhone users may want to consider Macs because of the seamless integration with Apple's other platforms. You can't respond to iMessage conversations easily or hop into FaceTime chats on Windows PCs, but doing so is simple on Macs. (Microsoft's Phone Link app lets you send iOS users individual texts, but not media or group chats.) Android users, meanwhile, may be better off with Windows, as Phone Link can make calls, synchronize all your texts and also access your phone's photos.\nIf cloud gaming is your priority, Windows laptops with NVIDIA’s GeForce Now or Xbox Cloud Gaming compatibility may offer more flexibility and decent performance, especially when paired with fast internet speeds. Chromebooks also make a compelling case here as an affordable, lightweight solution for casual cloud gaming sessions.\nAs for whether you’ll want a PC with a dedicated Copilot AI button on the keyboard, that depends on how often you see yourself using Microsoft’s generative tools. Given we’re only just seeing the first slate of AI PCs, it would be wiser to wait out the hype and see what improvements might come over time.\nAnd what about ChromeOS? Chromebooks are a smart and (typically) inexpensive way to do things like web browsing and hopping on a few video chats, but for most, they're not the best choice as a primary computer. There aren't many apps or games that work offline, and they also don't work with powerful software suites like Adobe's (you can use the stripped-down Adobe Express and Photoshop online tools, though).\nChromebooks are great secondary machines to use alongside a more powerful Mac or PC, and they're popular in schools because they're cheap and easy for IT workers to manage. And if all you need is web browsing access, or a notebook for a kid, a Chromebook might be enough.\nIf, for some reason, you’re looking for a powerful ChromeOS system, there are also Chromebook Plus models to consider. These machines sport faster processors and more RAM than typical Google notebooks, and they can also tap into a few of the company’s online AI features, like AI image generation and photo processing.\nPrice\nYou can expect to spend between $1,000 and $1,800 for a new laptop these days, depending on the configuration. If you're looking for more of a workhorse, that could cost you well over $2,000 for additional RAM, storage, as well as a beefier graphics card and CPU. But you can also find some good laptops under $1,000 if you're willing to overlook build quality (or buy a refurbished or previous generation machine, which we highly recommend). Systems with AMD chips tend to come in cheaper than their Intel counterparts, but the bulk of their cost will come down to other components like RAM and storage.\nI’ve included our favorite affordable model in this best laptop buying guide, but we have a list of the best budget laptops that you can check out as well.\nLaptop size and weight\nSo how portable do you want your laptop to be? That's the ultimate question you need to ask when choosing between various screen sizes. 13-inch machines have become a solid starting point for most shoppers — it's enough real estate for the majority of tasks like emailing and writing, and it also helps keep machines relatively light (typically between two to three pounds). Thanks to manufacturing advancements, these dainty machines sometimes even come with larger screens (the smaller MacBook Air actually has a 13.6-inch display).\nIf you have trouble seeing fine text, we’d recommend going for a display larger than 13 inches. ASUS’s Zephyrus G14 is a solid 14-inch option for gamers, and we’re also seeing more productivity-focused machines aim for that size, like the Dell 14 Premium and MacBook Pro. While 14-inch notebooks are a bit heavier than 13-inch models, coming in between three to four pounds, their screens are noticeably roomier.\nFor artists, or anyone else who needs a large canvas, a 15-inch laptop may make the most sense. They typically weigh between 3.5 and 4.5 pounds, but that extra heft may be worth it to fit wider video editing timelines or Photoshop windows. And, as you'd expect, you'll also pay a bit more for a 15-inch notebook compared to smaller ones (the 15-inch MacBook Air starts at $1,199, while the smaller model goes for $999). PC makers are also replacing 15-inch systems with 16-inch versions, which will give you even more space to work.\nIf you're in the market for a business laptop, size and portability might be key considerations. A lightweight yet powerful system with a long battery life can make a world of difference if you travel frequently for work.\nYou can still find laptops with 17-inch or 18-inch screens, but those are typically gaming systems or souped-up workstations. They're not meant for mere computing mortals.\nPorts and connectivity\nThese days, most laptops ship with a few USB-C ports, which can handle both charging and speedy data transfers. Apple's MacBooks also include a separate connection for MagSafe power, and you'll find custom power connections on some PCs like Microsoft's Surface. Older USB Type-A connections are less common now, but they still pop up in systems like HP's Spectre x360 14, as well as many models from ASUS.\nFor gamers or creators who rely on discrete graphics, ensuring your laptop has the right ports for external monitors or GPUs is crucial. DisplayPort or HDMI connections can also ensure you’re ready for dual- or multi-screen setups for more immersive experiences. Similarly, if you want to save high-resolution files or install multiple games, you might need to consider additional hard drive space; external hard drives are pretty affordable, as long as you have a proper port to connect them.\nIf you're a fan of wired headphones, it's worth keeping a close eye on headphone jack availability. They usually include a USB-C to 3.5mm adapter, but that's a clunky solution, and it also takes up a USB port. Sure, most people use wireless earbuds and cans today, but it's still helpful to have a wired one around for when those devices run out of juice.\nMost laptops today offer Wi-Fi 6 or 6E and Bluetooth 5.0 or later, which should mean faster and more stable connections if you have compatible routers and devices. While Wi-Fi 7 routers have started appearing, that spec hasn't made its way into laptops yet. As for cellular coverage, there are notebooks like the Surface Pro 9 and Samsung Galaxy Book models that offer integrated 5G. But from our testing, that feature may not be worth the cost of a separate data plan. Instead, you could tether to your smartphone or invest in a wireless hotspot that can keep multiple devices online.\nBattery life\nA laptop's battery life depends on several factors: The power draw from the screen and other hardware, the optimizations used to avoid unnecessary power drain, and, of course, the size of the actual battery. One of our previous favorite systems, the Dell XPS 13, lasted 13 hours and 15 minutes in the PCMark 10 battery benchmark. In real-world testing, I was able to use it for a day and a half without needing a recharge. The MacBook Air 13-inch, meanwhile, more than 18 hours in our benchmark and kept running for more than two work days of my typical workflow. In general, you should expect a modern laptop to last at least eight hours.\nIf battery life is your absolute priority, I'd strongly suggest looking at Macs over Windows PCs. Apple's M-series chips are essentially mobile hardware, with all of the power efficiency you'd expect from something originally designed for phones. Qualcomm’s upcoming Snapdragon chips could help Windows PCs compete with Apple’s astonishing battery life, but we’ve yet to see those in action. Chromebooks also typically get decent battery life (as long as you don’t overstuff them with power-draining tabs).\nRefresh rate\nA laptop's refresh rate refers to the amount of times its screen is cycled every second. Modern displays like IPS LCDs and OLEDs support 60Hz refresh rates at a minimum, but we're seeing more devices offering 120Hz, 240Hz and beyond. The higher the number, the faster the screen is refreshed, which ultimately leads to a smoother experience while mousing around or scrolling through web pages. (If you want to get a sense of what a slow refresh rate looks like, just grab an e-reader like the Kindle and try to flip between book pages.)\nWhile high refresh rates used to be reserved for gaming laptops, nowadays we're seeing more mainstream machines like the Dell 14 Premium offer 120Hz (or variable rates that move between 60Hz and 120Hz).\nCPU & GPU\nIf you’re buying a new laptop, you’ll want to make sure it’s powered by the latest CPUs. For Windows PCs, that includes Intel’s Core Ultra chips for thin-and-light machines or the 14th-gen HX chips for beefier systems. The Core Ultra series have NPUs for handling AI tasks, while the HX hardware does not – they’re based on Intel’s previous chip architecture, and they’re more focused on delivering raw horsepower. Intel's older 13th-gen and 12th-gen laptop chips also don't have NPUs, so keep that in mind if you're looking at used systems.\nYou'll also see AMD's Ryzen 8000 and 9000 chips in plenty of new systems like the ASUS Zephyrus G14 and Razer Blade 14. Those CPUs mainly target gaming laptops and high performance systems, while you'll still find AMD’s older Ryzen 7000 chips in ultraportables. AMD's main advantage is that its chips also include Radeon graphics, which are far more capable than Intel's Arc hardware (though those are getting better).\nQualcomm’s new Snapdragon X Elite and X Plus are also an option in Copilot+ PCs (more on those below). Since they’re based on mobile chip designs, they’re likely also more power efficient than AMD and Intel’s hardware. In the past, we’ve avoided recommending Snapdragon chips because they led to a slow and frustrating Windows experience. But Microsoft claims it’s rebuilt Windows 11 around Snapdragon’s Arm-based architecture, which should lead to far faster performance and better app compatibility.\nAs for Apple's laptops, you'll be choosing between the M4, M4 Pro and M4 Max, each of which is progressively more powerful.\nOn the graphics side of things, a GPU, or graphics processing unit, is the component that communicates directly with a laptop's display. Laptop CPUs all have some form of integrated GPU: Intel has either its standard graphics or beefier Arc hardware, while AMD's chips include fast Radeon mobile graphics. If you want to play demanding games at high speeds (measured in frames per second, or fps), or if you need some extra power for rendering video or 3D models, you can configure a laptop with a dedicated GPU like NVIDIA's RTX 40-series hardware or AMD's Radeon RX 7000. Just be sure to leave room in your budget if you want a powerful GPU, as they typically add $300 or more to the cost of a laptop.\nApple's M-series chips, meanwhile, have GPU cores that can perform as well as NVIDIA’s and AMD's lower-end dedicated GPUs. That's quite the accomplishment for systems like this (especially the MacBook Air and 14-inch MacBook Pro), and it's another reason we highly recommend Apple's notebooks.\nAI PCs, NPUs and Copilot+\nSimply put, an AI PC is a computer equipped with a neural processing unit (NPU), which is designed to handle AI-related tasks. Much like how GPUs tackle heavy-duty gaming and rendering workloads, NPUs are designed to handle the complex math necessary for AI workloads. They’re also far more power efficient than CPUs or GPUs, which could lead to better battery performance in laptops. While many factors go into NPU performance, for the most part we measure their potential speed by TOPS (tera operations per second).\nWe were primed for AI PCs based on the chips Intel and AMD announced in 2023. Intel unveiled its \"Core Ultra\" CPUs in December, its first to include an NPU for AI work. AMD also announced its Ryzen 8040 AI mobile chips that month (and it couldn't help but say they were faster than Intel's new hardware). But in May, Microsoft announced its Copilot+ initiative, which is pushing major PC makers to deliver premium AI PCs with specifications including 16GB of RAM, 256GB SSDs and NPUs with at least 40 TOPS of AI performance.\nCopilot+ is more than just a marketing term: Microsoft is also launching AI-powered features in Windows 11 that take advantage of powerful NPUs. That includes Recall, which can help you locate anything you’ve done on your PC (whenever it finally launches), as well as Cocreator in Paint, which can generate AI images based on text prompts and doodles.\nIf you buy an AI PC that isn’t Copilot+ certified, you’ll still be able to use some features like Windows Studio Effects, which can blur your background in video calls or keep you in frame. Developers like Adobe and Audacity are also building features into their apps that can take advantage of NPUs.\nAt the time of this post, Chromebook Plus notebooks can also access a few of Google’s online AI features, like image generation and photo processing.\nBack to top\nOther laptops we tested\nLenovo ThinkPad X9-14 Aura Edition\nThe ThinkPad X9-14 Aura Edition is a great spiritual successor to the ThinkPad X1 Carbon, offering the best that business laptops have to offer. That includes long battery life packed into a thin and light chassis. This is an optimal ultraportable business laptop.\nWhile the price might give you some pause, we tested the lowest configuration, and found that the X9-14’s performance is excellent for casual business users. The only issue with quality is that the keyboard is lacking. It’s mushier than we’d like, which could get a bit tiresome throughout the day. You’ll still miss out on a USB Type-A port, so you may need to carry a Type-C hub with you.\nWhere the ThinkPad X9-14 will win you over is its bold OLED screen. Combo that with its well-rounded audio, and the ThinkPad X9-14 makes for an excellent multimedia device in and out of the workplace.\nASUS Zenbook 14 OLED\nAside from its lovely OLED screen, the ASUS Zenbook 14 OLED doesn't stand out from the crowded laptop field in any way. It just looks dull and boring, especially compared to the strikingly beautiful ASUS Zephyrus G14, which also came out this year. While you can probably find the Zenbook 14 for a decent price, I'd recommend holding out for something with a bit more personality (and with a less wobbly screen hinge).\nRazer Blade 14\nThe Razer Blade has almost everything you'd want in a 14-inch gaming notebook, but it's far pricier than the Zephyrus G14 on this list, and it doesn’t even have an SD card reader. It would be a solid competitor once its price falls a bit, and it's certainly a great option if you just have to have a jet-black laptop.\nFramework Laptop 16\nFramework gave its modularity magic to the Laptop 16, delivering a gaming notebook where almost every single component is user replaceable. But you'll have to pay a pretty penny to snag it with upgraded hardware, and its optional Radeon 7700S GPU was surprisingly slow.\nAlienware m16 R2\nThe Alienware m16 r2 has been revamped with a slimmer case, but it’s otherwise a fairly typical gaming laptop. It’s a solid option for Alienware fans, but you’ll find better hardware and deals elsewhere.\nASUS Zenbook Duo (2024)\nThe Zenbook Duo is a fascinating dual-screened notebook, and according to my colleague Sam Rutherford it’s the first of its kind that’s worth buying. But its unique hardware isn’t really meant for mainstream consumers, and Windows 11 still doesn’t support multi-screen setups well enough to make full use of the Zenbook Duo’s ample canvas.\nDell XPS 16\nDell’s XPS 16 is big and beautiful, but it’s far too expensive compared to the competition. Plus, it uses a capacitive row of function keys that you basically can’t see under bright light and has too few ports for a machine of this size.\nSee Also:\n\nBest Gaming Laptops for 2025\nBest Cheap Windows Laptops\nBest 2-in-1 Laptops for 2025\nBest Chromebooks\nBest Laptops for College Students\n\nBack to top\nLaptop FAQs\nWhat is the average battery life of a laptop per charge?\nIt’s hard to come up with an average battery life for laptops, since that will ultimately depend on what you’re doing with them. An ultraportable like the MacBook Air that sips power can last around 20 hours in our battery benchmark, and around two full work days of real-world usage. But a gaming laptop may last only a few hours if you’re actively playing something while on battery. At this point, Macs are delivering far better battery life than PCs, thanks to Apple’s Silicon chips, but Microsoft claims Copilot+ systems with Qualcomm chips will also get over 20 hours of batter life.\nHow much RAM do I really need?\nThe more RAM you have, the more things your computer can do simultaneously. For that reason, we recommend buying PCs and Macs with at least 16GB of RAM. That gives you enough memory to have several applications open at once, as well as web browsers filled with RAM-hogging tabs. Many PC games also require at least 16GB of RAM. While you could use a system with 8GB of RAM for basic tasks, you’ll quickly run into slowdowns and error messages as your apps stack up. Many laptops, especially ultraportables, don’t let you upgrade RAM, too – so you’ll have to buy an entirely new computer if you didn’t equip enough memory at the start.\nIf you’re a hardcore gamer, programmer or planning to render videos or 3D models, then you may want to go for 32GB of RAM or more. And if you just need a secondary laptop for lighter work – perhaps a no-frills system for writing – then you can probably get by with 8GB. Just be sure to keep those browser tabs in check.\nWhat is the best storage capacity for a laptop?\nThere is no one-size-fits-all solution when it comes to laptop storage. You’ll typically find configurations between 256GB and 1TB SSDs (solid state drives) on most laptops, and I’d recommend most people get at least 512GB. That’ll be enough space for large apps, music and video files without stressing your system too much. If you’re a media hoarder, or want to play a ton of games, then it’s definitely worth getting a 1TB SSD.\nIf you’ll mainly be streaming your shows and music, and would rather invest in RAM or other hardware, then 256GB of storage would be serviceable. I’d recommend staying away from any machine with 128GB of storage though. Most of that will be taken up by the operating system, and you’ll likely run into issues cramming in large apps after a few months.\nWe recommend springing for extra built-in storage or investing in a portable SSD for backing up your most important files. It's also worth noting that Chromebooks tend to come with less built-in storage — 32GB, 64GB or 128GB — since ChromeOS encourages users to save their files in the cloud rather than on the device. In that case, 128GB is plenty.\nWhat's a good price range for a decent laptop in 2025?\nYou can expect to spend between $1,000 and $1,800 for a typical 13-inch laptop today. As I explained above, you'll pay more if you want to stuff in more RAM or better GPU hardware. But you can also find deals below $1,000 if you look for refurbished or older-generation models.\nWhat’s the difference between macOS and Windows? Which is better?\nSimply put, macOS is the operating system in all of Apple's notebooks and desktops, while Windows powers the vast majority of PCs. You'll also find Chromebooks running Google's ChromeOS, but those are basically just web browsers running on top of Linux.\nDebating the differences between Windows and Macs is something PC nerds have been doing since the '80s, so we won't be declaring a winner here. There are some small, negligible distinctions, like using a Command versus a Control key, how file explorers work and concerns about viruses and security. For the most part, those are minor issues or have become moot thanks to better built-in security.\nBut if you care more about playing the newest games, you'll want to have a Windows system. If you're more focused on creative apps, like Photoshop, Premiere and Final Cut Pro, then macOS may be a better fit (especially if you're running an iPhone).\nWhat are the best laptop brands?\nThere is no single \"best\" laptop brand, but judging from this guide alone, we're generally impressed by notebooks from Apple, Dell and ASUS. They all offer fast, reliable and sturdy machines. HP also makes some eye-catching devices if you want an option that’s the most aesthetic. Those four brands, along with Lenovo and Acer, dominate laptop sales worldwide. We'd avoid systems from any retail store brands, or companies that don't have a major presence in the US.\nBack to top\nRecent updates\nAugust 2025: Updated our top picks to include the Dell 14 Premium.\nMay 2025: Updated to ensure top picks and details are still accurate.\nMarch 2025: Updated to include the M4-powered MacBook Air.\nNovember 2024: Updated to include the M4-powered MacBook Pros.\nAugust 2024: Updated to include the Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 12.\nBack to topThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/best-laptops-120008636.html?src=rss",

The current $20 plan appears to be one of several options based on different feature sets. Earlier this week, users on Reddit and Threads noticed that The Browser Company had quietly made the Pro plan available online.

    "full_text": "New details on Wi-Fi 8 were just released by Qualcomm, with the standard expected to be finalized in 2028. While Wi-Fi 7 is all about speed, increasing the maximum amount of data that could be transmitted from 2.4Gbps to 5.8Gbps, Wi-Fi 8 will focus on improving reliability. Online gaming and videoconferencing don’t require more than 50Mbps speeds, but the median US household gets 288Mbps. 25% fewer dropped packets especially when roaming between access points. “With things like AI, there's a significant dependency on higher reliability for your Wi-Fi.” Wi-Fi 8 engineers are also working to develop a standard that can hold up in difficult environments where congestion, interference and coverage boundaries have impaired the user experience in the past. Qualcomm’s report cites the increase in “personal device ecosystems” like augmented reality glasses, health monitors and wearable tech as a reason for improving the dynamism of local Wi-Fi networks. In past Wi-Fi standards, slight interruptions or packet drops were common as the device gets handed off to a different access point. These routers will also be designed to work in high-density environments like apartment buildings or airports, where overlapping signals can often result in a laggy and slow connection. Fortunately, Wi-Fi 6 and Wi-Fi 7 routers still offer more than enough speed for most households, and there are several things you can do to increase the reliability of your network right now:"

According to reports citing local authorities, Coristine — who left DOGE in June but quickly returned to federal service at the Social Security Administration to help improve the agency’s website — was with a female friend around 3 a.m. Sunday in Washington’s Logan Circle when a circle of roughly 10 teens approached their car and made comments about taking it. He reportedly pushed the woman into the car for her safety before confronting the mob, which then attacked him until police drove up, called to the scene by Coristine’s companion, who’d phoned 911. On Tuesday, Musk praised Coristine for his bravery on his social media platform, X. President Trump separately shared an image of a battered Coristine on Truth Social, using the assault to call for prosecuting teens as young as 14 as adults, and for “federalizing” Washington."

They’re also capable of multipoint Bluetooth connectivity, so you can pair them with two devices at the same time. They’re also the only AirPods that come with different sizes of ear tips for a customizable fit — including an extra small option. And my favorite thing about these earbuds are the hands-free voice commands that don’t require you to say any specific wake phrase beforehand. And there’s a small nub on the buds to help lock them in place even during intensive activities like running or exercise. Multipoint support is included, and Google’s latest earbuds eke out impressive battery life that surpasses most competitors. Apple’s AirPods 4 come in two different versions, with a higher-priced option that includes active noise cancellation and wireless charging.

An AI model may not be able to accurately or transparently explain itself. OpenAI's ChatGPT (among others) has been totally crushed at chess by the computer opponent in a 1979 Atari game. A recent research paper from Apple found that models can struggle with other puzzles, like the Tower of Hanoi. You might expect LLMs to be able to solve Sudoku because they're computers and the puzzle consists of numbers, but the puzzles themselves are not really mathematical; they're symbolic. \"Sudoku is famous for being a puzzle with numbers that could be done with anything that is not numbers,\" said Fabio Somenzi, a professor at CU and one of the research paper's authors. I used a sample prompt from the researchers' paper and gave it to ChatGPT. Testing OpenAI's o1-preview reasoning model, the researchers saw that the explanations -- even for correctly solved puzzles -- didn't accurately explain or justify their moves and got basic terms wrong."

For around $300, the Tapo RV30 Max Plus is a very capable robot vacuum and mop with some key features usually only found on vacuums that are more than twice its price. It left some of the finer dust and debris, as its single bristle / rubber brush isn’t super effective. You can also set the cleaning direction and build up to four maps — again, features usually only found on higher-end robots. The Roborock S8 is a great vacuum that mops well and has AI-powered obstacle detection—a rarity at this price point. Another great feature at this price is that the S8 has carpet sensing and can raise its mops a few millimeters to avoid dampening your carpets. Most other budget mopping bots require you to remove the mop pads when vacuuming carpet or set keep-out zones around your rugs. The Q5 Pro doesn’t have AI-powered obstacle avoidance, although it will dodge shoes and larger objects.

Trump just announced he’ll putting an enormous 100 percent tariff on chips and semiconductors — unless your company kisses the ring like Apple CEO Tim Cook just did, perhaps. In the same live news conference where Apple announced a new $100 billion US manufacturing plan and presented Trump with a 24-karat gold and glass statue, the president explained that Apple had now done enough to escape his upcoming import taxes on chips: We’re going to be putting a very large tariff on chips and semiconductors, but the good news for companies like Apple is if you’re building in the United States or have committed to build without question in the United States, there will be no charge. You have to pay, and that’s a guarantee. Taiwan’s TSMC, which accounts for the vast majority of leading-edge chips and drew Trump’s ire as a result, announced a $100 billion US investment back in March. Apple isn’t exactly a chipmaker, after all; it does design its own chips but relies on companies like TSMC to actually make them. Trump did not say when new chip tariffs might happen. Trump’s new general reciprocal tariffs on dozens of countries go into effect tomorrow, August 7th. In July, AMD CEO Lisa Su revealed that TSMC’s US-made chips would cost it an extra 5 to 20 percent more than ones made overseas."

As part of this additional investment, Apple says it's also deepening its relationship and investment in component makers working in the US, like Corning and Amkor. \nCorning produces the glass for iPhones and Apple Watches, and the company says that \"soon, every iPhone and Apple Watch sold around the world will be built with Kentucky-made cover glass.\" Apple is investing in Amkor to take advantage of the company's \"advanced chip packaging and test facility in Arizona.\" Apple says its \"leading the creation of an end-to-end silicon supply chain in the United States\" through its investments.\nIn addition, Apple said it would be working with Samsung \"to launch an innovative new technology for making chips, which has never been used before anywhere in the world.\" Those chips will reportedly be cutting-edge image sensors for iPhone cameras and be built in Texas, according to The Financial Times. Apple may be shifting at least part of its sensor purchases to Samsung from Sony due to tariffs — Samsung has chip plants in the US and Sony doesn't. Apple said that Texas Instruments, Broadcom and GlobalFoundries would expand component manufacturing in the US as well. \nIn a statement to Bloomberg before the announcement, a White House spokesperson suggested the new investment would \"help reshore the production of critical components to protect America’s economic and national security.\" The Trump administration has previously called for Apple to make the iPhone in the US, something CNN reports is difficult to downright impossible.\nApple's current strategy for dealing with Trump is similar to how it handled the President during his first term. In 2019, Apple CEO Time Cook and Trump \"opened\" a Mac Pro factory in Texas. The factory had been up-and-running since 2013, but the President was pleased by the optics of making a deal. Apple's partnership with Amkor was similarly announced years ago in 2023, but is being trotted out now because it fits with Apple's \"American Manufacturing Program.\"\nApple is a trillion-dollar company that can afford to spend a few billion to avoid paying tariffs, but it also likely planned to increase its investment in the US anyway to keep up with competitors. It's entirely possible the company is just packaging its spending in a way that flatters the President. \nSteve Dent contributed to this report.

Test patterns, sent from a Portrait Displays VideoForge PRO 8K, are then used to adjust the various picture settings so the projector looks its best before measurement and evaluation. Contrast ratios are measured in each lamp or LED/laser and iris mode (when available). Contrast ratio is the most important part of any projector's performance. The most accurate projectors produce lifelike colors that are very natural to watch. Light output is the second most important factor, because it's not only how bright the image appears on your wall, but also how big an image you can produce. We measure brightness in candelas per square meter (cd/m2) and then convert to estimated lumens for ease of comparison. Budget models, those that prioritize brightness over everything, along with devices from newcomers to the projector space often have wildly inaccurate colors that result in a very unnatural image. These are rarely a major factor in projector performance, but some models still use older chips that have issues. Those are difficult to do at the same time, but as long as the balance works and it looks better than its competitors at a similar price, it's a winner."

Guided learning “acts as a learning companion” that guides you with “questions and step-by-step support,” CEO Sundar Pichai says in a blog post. Answers from the guided learning mode can include things like images, videos, and interactive quizzes. The company worked with students, educators, researchers, and learning experts to ensure the mode is “helpful for understanding new concepts and is backed by learning science,” according to Pichai. AI companies are increasingly pushing into education — perhaps in part to try and fight the reputation that AI tools have acquired that they help students cheat. Features like Gemini’s guided learning mode and ChatGPT’s similar study mode, which was announced last week, could theoretically help with actual learning, but the question is whether students will want to use these modes instead of just using the AI chatbots for easy answers. As part of its announcements on Wednesday, Google is now letting students 18 and older in the US, Japan, Indonesia, Korea, and Brazil sign up for 12 months of its AI Pro Plan for free, as long as they do so by October 6th.

As part of its investment, Apple has agreed to an expanded partnership with Corning to manufacture “100 percent” of the iPhone and Apple Watch cover glass in Kentucky. It will also work with Samsung at its chip fab in Austin, Texas, “to launch an innovative new technology for making chips, which has never been used before anywhere in the world,” according to Apple’s press release. Last month, Apple announced that it will open a manufacturing academy in Michigan to help train American companies in “advanced manufacturing” techniques as well. It’s not clear whether Apple’s new promises will satiate Trump, who believes Apple can make its iPhones in the US. Trump has criticized Apple for not bringing the work back to the US instead, and threatened the company with a 25 percent tariff if it doesn’t manufacture more products domestically. Apple revealed last week that Trump’s tariffs could add another $1.1 billion to its costs during the September quarter, adding to the $800 million it has already spent on the levies.

The Perseids meteor shower is about to give you a real light show, provided you're far enough away from light pollution to see it. The show started on July 17, and will run through Aug. 23. During its peak, the meteor shower is known to rain down as many as 100 meteors per hour, according to the American Meteor Society. Per NASA, fireballs tend to last longer than standard shooting stars and can come in a variety of different colors. Until then, it leaves behind an excellent tail of dust and debris to feed us yearly meteor showers. During this time, the shower will produce anywhere from 25 to 100 meteors per hour on average. Thus, if you're planning on watching this year's Perseids during their peak, you'll want to get out of the city and suburbs as far as possible. Like all meteors, Perseids are named after the constellation from which they appear. Thus, it is highly probable that light pollution from the moon may reduce the number of visible meteors by a hefty margin, depending on how things go."

In short, the analysis painted an abysmal outlook for anyone relying on web traffic. But on Wednesday, Google Search head Liz Reid penned a blog post that puts quite a different spin on things. The Google VP claims traffic from search to websites is \"relatively stable\" and that click quality has increased.\nReid's framing boils down to everything is peachy, and AI is making things better — even for websites! She wrote that Google Search's total organic click volume to websites has been \"relatively\" stable year-over-year. Reid also claimed Google sends more \"quality clicks\" (visitors who don't quickly bounce) to websites than a year ago. The company says people are also happier with the search experience.\nThe company didn't share any numbers — the post has no data whatsoever — to support its claims.\nGoogle's explanation for the rosy outlook? \"With AI Overviews, people are searching more and asking new questions that are often longer and more complex,\" Reid wrote. \"In addition, with AI Overviews, people are seeing more links on the page than before. More queries and more links mean more opportunities for websites to surface and get clicked.\"\nReid does highlight a shifting landscape. She says user trends are resulting in lower traffic for some sites and increased traffic for others. Of course, the Google Search head didn't call out any specific websites. But she claims forums, videos, podcasts and posts with \"authentic voices and first-hand perspectives\" are thriving. Reid added that content like \"an in-depth review, an original post, a unique perspective, or a thoughtful first-person analysis\" does well.\nGoogle / Engadget\nThe Google VP said people seeking simple Q&A types of searches are leaning more on AI. \"For some questions where people are looking for a quick answer, like 'when is the next full moon,' people may be satisfied with the initial AI Overviews response and not click further,\" Reid wrote. \"This has also been true for other answer features we've added, like the Knowledge Graph or sports scores. But for many other types of questions, people continue to click through, as they want to dig deeper into a topic, explore further or make a purchase. This is why we see click quality increasing — an AI response might provide the lay of the land, but people click to dive deeper and learn more, and when they do, these clicks are more valuable.\"\nIt's quite the contrast from the Pew report. It found that visitors who saw an AI summary clicked a traditional search result in eight percent of all visits. Those without an AI summary? They clicked on a traditional result in 15 percent of their visits. As for those source links in AI summaries? Pew found that only one percent of people clicked on those. Users were also more likely to end their browsing after visiting a page with an AI summary.\nThat aligned with comments Cloudflare CEO Matthew Prince made in June. He said search traffic referrals keep plummeting. \"The future of the web is going to be more and more like AI, and that means that people are going to be reading the summaries of your content, not the original content,\" he said. Prince said that a decade ago, Google sent a publisher one visitor for every two pages it crawled. Early this year, it dropped to one visitor for every six pages. He said that, in June, it was down to one for every 18.\nI can't tell you who to believe.

It includes videos showing how the right Gemini prompts could be used to open windows, turn off lights, turn on a boiler or geolocate the current user. As the Invitation is All You Need research shows, a detailed prompt can be hidden in an innocuous Calendar invite title or similar spot. These commands can make Gemini create a hidden agent and wait for a common response (like saying \"thank you\" in an email) to trigger certain actions. Even if your calendar controls are tight, some of these promptware attacks could be performed through other things that Gemini scans, such as an email subject line. Google told CNET they have introduced multiple fixes to address the promptware vulnerabilities since the researchers provided Google with their report in February 2015. Their research helped us better understand novel attack pathways, and accelerated our work to deploy new, cutting edge defenses which are now in place protecting users.\" But as these new generative AIs get added to smart homes (the slowly rolling out Alexa Plus and eventual Siri AI upgrades included), there's a chance they could bring new vulnerabilities with them."

    "summary": "\nYour iPhone's operating system is getting a big upgrade this fall with the release of iOS 26. One of the better changes — and also Apple's largest visual update in years — is the new Liquid Glass design (think Windows Vista, but arguably more thoughtful). We spent two weeks test-driving it — you can check out our detailed hands-on iOS 26 preview, or you can try it out yourself by downloading and installing the public beta. That software is a more stable iteration of the separate developer version, which recently hit the beta 5 waypoint, and offers a few more flashy features not yet available in the public version. (While the public beta is open to everyone and quite stable, always remember there's a degree of risk involved with beta software.) Not ready to upgrade your smartphone this year? No worries, we'll help you find out if your phone will be able to run iOS 26.\nWhile Apple didn't nix any iPhones from its eligibility list last year, that's not the case for 2025 — a few models are getting cut this time. All iPhone 8 models and the iPhone X were the last to get the boot in 2023, and this year the 2018 models are getting left behind. If you have an ineligible device, you won't be able to download iOS 26 when it becomes available this fall.\nWe'll get to the bottom of which iPhones will support iOS 26 this year. To see what's coming with the latest OS and more, check out everything announced at Apple's WWDC June 9 event. One thing you shouldn't immediately expect is Apple's updated version of Siri, though the company is reportedly working on a 'stripped-down' AI chatbot to compete with ChatGPT.\nThese three iPhones won't be compatible with iOS 26\nUnlike last year, several iPhone models won't be eligible to download the newest iOS when it makes its debut this fall. This trio of models first released in 2018 won't be coming to the iOS 26 party:\n\niPhone XR\niPhone XS\niPhone XS Max\n\niPhones compatible with iOS 26\nWhile we don't yet know the new iPhones Apple will be dropping this fall — though there are iPhone 17 rumors — we do know, per Apple's site, that the phones listed below will be compatible with iOS 26. Basically, if you have an iPhone that was announced in 2019 or later, you're in the clear:\n\niPhone SE (second generation or later)\niPhone 11\niPhone 11 Pro\niPhone 11 Pro Max\niPhone 12\niPhone 12 mini\niPhone 12 Pro\niPhone 12 Pro Max\niPhone 13\niPhone 13 mini\niPhone 13 Pro\niPhone 13 Pro Max\niPhone 14\niPhone 14 Plus\niPhone 14 Pro\niPhone 14 Pro Max\niPhone 15\niPhone 15 Plus\niPhone 15 Pro\niPhone 15 Pro Max\niPhone 16e\niPhone 16\niPhone 16 Plus\niPhone 16 Pro\niPhone 16 Pro Max\n\nWhat if I don't want to buy a new iPhone?\nIf you want to continue using your older iPhone that isn't supported by iOS 26, that's fine. However, you'll miss out on security updates which could potentially put your phone at risk for malware and other threats. Additionally, some apps may stop working if they require a certain version of iOS or later. And of course, you won't be able to access the latest features iOS 26 offers.\nWhen will iOS 26 become available?\nApple usually rolls out its latest iOS in mid-September, just a few days before the new iPhones hit store shelves. Last year, it released iOS 18 on Monday, Sept. 16. Expect a confirmation of the release date at the iPhone 17 event, expected in early September. \niOS 26 features we're excited about\nLiquid Glass design: Your home screen is getting revamped with new app icons, including dark mode and all-clear options. You'll also notice buttons with a new floating design. Liquid Glass was designed to make all of Apple's OSes more cohesive.\nPhone app redesign: You'll finally be able to scroll through contacts, recent calls and voicemail messages all on one screen. It also comes with a new feature called Hold Assist that'll notify you when an agent comes to the phone so you can avoid the elevator music.\nLive Translate: iOS 26 is bringing the ability to have a conversation via phone call or text message with someone who speaks another language. Live Translate will translate your conversation in real time. \nPolls feature: Coming to group messages in the Messages app, chat members will be able to create polls.

    "full_text": "Ugreen Qi2 magnetic power bank: Less well-known battery companies, like Ugreen and Baseus, are trying to take on Anker on Amazon with value power banks like this Qi2 magnetic wireless charger ($35). It's fairly slim for a 10,000-mAh battery and offers up 15-watt wireless charging and 20W wireless charging if you plug the battery into a 20W or higher power adapter. Mophie Powerstation Plus Mini: If you have one of the newer iPhones with USB-C charging, or an Android smartphone with USB-C, the Mophie Powerstation Plus Mini ($50) is a relatively compact power bank with an integrated USB-C cable that offers 20-watt fast charging. The mini version has a 5,000-mAh battery that will fully recharge most smartphones at once. Mophie Powerstation Plus: If you're still using Apple devices with Lightning connectors but also want a power bank that can charge USB-C equipped devices, the Mophie Powerstation Plus ($80), while fairly price, is a nice option with its dual UBC-C/Lightning cable design. The smaller Mini version costs about $30 less and has only a single USB-C cable (it's a 5,000-mAH battery), while the Mophie Powerstation Plus ($100) also has dual cables but adds retractable prongs so you can charge it in any power outlet. Its only drawback is that it's a little bulky for on-the-go use. You have to pay a bit more for going green, but it's a nice, compact 10,000-mAh charger that features 20-watt PD fast-charging with dual USB-C ports (one on either side of the power bank) that allow you to charge two devices at the same time. While the Anker 313 PowerCore Slim 10K is cheaper, this offers fast USB-C outcharging, which makes spending the extra dough a big plus if you have a USB-C-to-Lightning cable. Anker PowerCore III 10K Portable Charger: The Anker PowerCore III 10K portable charger has fast USB-C out charging (18 watts) as well as a USB-A port and up to 10-watt wireless charging."

Games is unclear, as it shut down several studios and canceled anticipated games earlier this year. But there’s no arguing that the company’s back catalog of titles is full of gems, many of which are in Humble’s great $12 bundle. Through August 27th, you can jump on this unbeatable deal that gets you 16 WB Games titles on Steam for just $12, with proceeds going to the Raiden Science Foundation. This bittersweet bundle features an array of licensed and original open-world titles, fighting games, and first-person shooters from WB Games’ studios — most of which have either fallen from grace in recent years or have been shut down. The standout for me is Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor, Monolith’s third-person action game that features the excellent Nemesis System, a mechanic that allows enemies to remember and react to players. For instance, if an enemy kills you in battle, that enemy will get stronger and remember your last encounter, making fights feel more personal. Other highlights include Batman: Arkham City, Batman: Arkham Asylum, and the oft-overlooked Mad Max. There’s a lot of fun to be had with other games in the bundle too, like Mortal Kombat 11, Mortal Kombat XL, Middle-earth: Shadow of War, and Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, among others. In most cases, you’ll be getting the most content-complete versions of the games with the purchase."

    "summary": "Liquid Glass is a huge new change coming to iOS 26. (Apple)\nThe wait for upgrading your iPhone to iOS 26 keeps getting shorter, but we're still over a month out from the release, which is expected this fall. But if you want to start testing out the new features today, you can download and install Apple's public beta, which CEO Tim Cook recently said is (along with the other current beta operating systems) \"by far the most popular developer betas we’ve had,\" 9to5Mac reports. You can also take a look at our preview of the iOS 26 public beta release, which shows off the fresh home and lock screen redesign. Called Liquid Glass, the new translucent look will extend across all of Apple's upcoming operating systems. The overhaul is one of several big changes coming to iOS, macOS, iPadOS and the rest of Apple's software suite, all of which were showcased during the company's WWDC keynote on June 9. \nAfter overpromising on AI plans last year, Apple kept its iOS roadmap focused more on basic quality of life improvements this year. There are multiple useful additions coming to the Phone and Messages apps on your iPhone, for instance: Apple execs outlined the ability to weed out spam texts or other unknown senders and an option to hold your spot on a phone call when you've been waiting for a representative to pick up. Plus, a treasured feature that we took for granted is coming back (hint: it's in the Photos app).\nSiri, meanwhile, is in a holding pattern. Apple has previously specified that its smarter voice assistant — first promised at WWDC 2024 — is delayed until some point \"in the coming year,\" so you shouldn't expect any major changes in the current betas. But there are reports that Apple is aiming to give Siri a bigger brain transplant by basing it on third-party artificial intelligence models like OpenAI's ChatGPT or Anthropic's Claude, which could make 2026 a pivotal year. The company is also reportedly working on a 'stripped-down' AI chatbot to rival ChatGPT.\nWith each beta, it seems like additional new improvements are popping up, like this FaceTime feature that'll freeze your video if it detects nudity. Now that iOS 26 developer beta 5 is available, we're seeing more added features, like a new bouncy animation on the passcode screen and in the Control Center, MacRumors reports. Some or all of those changes will likely soon migrate into the separate public beta (see below). Most newer iPhone models are eligible to download iOS 26 (both the betas and final version). Want to see the full list of new features coming this fall? Read on.  \nWhat is iOS 26?\nThe current iPhone operating system is iOS 18, and Apple is still actively updating it — version 18.6 was just recently released. But don't expect to see iOS 19. Instead, Apple is skipping the numbering ahead to iOS 26 later this year. The company has decided to line up its iOS version numbers with a year-based system, similar to car model years. So while iOS and its sibling operating systems will be released in late 2025, they're all designated \"26\" to reflect the year ahead. (Meanwhile, iOS 18 is still getting new versions this summer, too.)\nIt's official, we're moving to iOS 26. (Apple)\nWhat is Liquid Glass design?\nLet's be honest. Out of everything announced at WWDC this year, the new Liquid Glass design was the star of the show. The iPhone's home and lock screens have looked pretty much the same year after year — the last exciting thing (in my opinion) was the option to add your own aesthetic to your home screen by customizing your apps and widgets. So seeing the home and lock screens' new facelift is refreshing.\nSo what exactly is Liquid Glass? Apple calls it a \"new translucent material\" since, well, the apps and widgets are clear. However, the screen can still adapt to dark and light modes, depending on surroundings. You'll also notice buttons with a new floating design in several apps, like Phone and Maps. They're designed to be less distracting than the current buttons, but are still easy to see. While the design overhaul has proven to be controversial since its announcement, some — including Engadget's own Devindra Hardawar — like the new direction, even if it's somewhat reminiscent of Microsoft's translucent Windows Vista Aero designs from nearly twenty years ago.\nThat said, as of the release of the iOS 26 beta 2, Apple has already incorporated some user feedback into the design, dialing back the transparency in at least some places. And while it will continue to evolve, Apple users won't be able to escape it: Liquid Glass was designed to make all of Apple's OSes more cohesive. Here's a look at how the translucent aesthetic will look with the new macOS Tahoe 26 on your desktop.\nWhat are the new and notable features of iOS 26?\niOS 26 has a laundry list of new features. Among the most worthwhile:\nPhone app redesign: You'll finally be able to scroll through contacts, recent calls and voicemail messages all on one screen. It also comes with a new feature called Hold Assist that'll notify you when an agent comes to the phone so you can avoid the elevator music and continue on with other tasks.\nLive Translation in Phone, FaceTime and Messages: iOS 26 is bringing the ability to have a conversation via phone call or text message with someone who speaks another language. Live Translation will translate your conversation in real time, which results in some stop-and-go interactions in the examples Apple shared during its presentation.\nPolls in group chats: Tired of sorting through what seems like hundreds of messages in your group chat? You and your friends will soon be able to create polls in group messages for deciding things like which brunch spot you're eating at or whose car you're taking on a road trip.\nFiltering unknown senders in Messages: If you haven't received spam texts about unpaid tolls or other citations, you're lucky. For those of us who have, those annoying messages will soon be filtered away in a separate folder.\nVisual Intelligence: Similar to a reverse Google image search, this new feature will allow you to search for anything that's on your iPhone screen. For instance, if you spot a pair of shoes someone is wearing in an Instagram photo, you can screenshot it and use Visual Intelligence to find those shoes (or similar ones) online.\nPhotos tabs are back: For anyone who's still frustrated with the Photos changes made last year, you'll be happy to know that your tabs are coming back. Library and Collections will have their own separate spaces so you don't have to scroll to infinity to find what you're looking for.\nFaceTime \"Communication Safety\" feature: A newer addition to iOS 26 appears to be the FaceTime \"Communication Safety\" feature that pauses communications if and when nudity is detected. The feature appears to be a child safety feature that uses on-device detection, thus obviating any cloud-based privacy issues. \nApple's Hold Assist will be nifty for those pesky services that put you on hold for 10 or more minutes. (Apple)\nWhich iPhones will be able to upgrade to iOS 26?\nA few iPhone models that run the current version of iOS — iPhone XR, XS and XS Max — won't be compatible with the latest upgrade. But any iPhones released in 2019 or later will be eligible for the iOS 26 update.\n\niPhone SE (second generation or later)\niPhone 11\niPhone 11 Pro\niPhone 11 Pro Max\niPhone 12\niPhone 12 mini\niPhone 12 Pro\niPhone 12 Pro Max\niPhone 13\niPhone 13 mini\niPhone 13 Pro\niPhone 13 Pro Max\niPhone 14\niPhone 14 Plus\niPhone 14 Pro\niPhone 14 Pro Max\niPhone 15\niPhone 15 Plus\niPhone 15 Pro\niPhone 15 Pro Max\niPhone 16e\niPhone 16\niPhone 16 Plus\niPhone 16 Pro\niPhone 16 Pro Max\n\nNot listed here are the presumed new iPhone 17 models (or maybe iPhone 26?) that are all but certain to be announced and released in September. \nHow to install iOS 26 beta\nThe iOS 26 public beta is now available to download via the Apple Beta Software Program. If you're not already a member, you'll need to sign up to try out all the latest features. Just visit beta.apple.com and sign up with your phone number or email address. It's free.\nOnce you're in, you can install it by going to Settings > General > Software Update and selecting iOS 26 public beta. \nA word of caution: Don't sign up with your main iPhone unless you're OK with any risks that occur with using an OS that isn't finalized.\nWhen will the final version of iOS 26 be released?\niOS 26 will be released to the public this fall. It usually comes in September, within a week of the Apple iPhone event. Last year, it rolled out to iPhone users on September 16 — exactly one week after the iPhone 16 lineup was announced.\nIf you're more interested in the Apple Intelligence features coming, here's everything Apple revealed for iOS, macOS and more during WWDC. Also, check out how iOS 26 screenshots could be an intriguing preview of Apple's delayed Siri rework.\nUpdate, August 6: Noted the release of iOS 26 beta 5 and the new bouncy feature on passcode screen and Control Center.\nUpdate, August 4: Noted that Apple is reportedly working on a ChatGPT rival.\nUpdate, August 1: Added quote from Tim Cook about iOS 26.\nUpdate, July 31: Noted that iOS 18.6 is now available. \nUpdate, July 24: Noted the iOS 26 public beta is now available.\nUpdate, July 3: Noted new FaceTime feature found in the developer beta.\nUpdate, June 30: Noted ongoing iOS 18 releases, and reports that Apple is considering additional external LLMs for Siri. \nUpdate, June 25: Noted changes added in iOS 26 beta 2. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/apple-ios-26-beta-is-available-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-new-iphone-update-135749850.html?src=rss",

WhatsApp's new \"guest chats\" feature doesn't come without risks, says Chuck Brooks, president of Brooks Consulting International and once called one of the \"5 Tech Voices You Should Be Following on LinkedIn.\" Brooks notes that the change offers the possibility that users with bad intentions will pose as trustworthy people, provide dangerous links or attempt phishing schemes. \"Unknown contacts may forward and include links to phishing websites that aim to steal personal data or infect a user's device with malware,\" he said. \"It can also result in unwanted interaction, such as harassment or unwelcome group additions, when you receive messages from strangers.\" Aras Nazarovas, security researcher at Lithuania-based Cybernews, said WhatsApp users need to avoid making \"easy mistakes\" with the guest chats feature to avoid security issues. \"But overall, from what we know, it's a good compatibility feature for people who have a WhatsApp account and those who don't.\" One of the provisions of that legislation was allowing WhatsApp and Messenger users in Europe to communicate with people using other messaging services, or what Meta refers to as \"third-party chats.\""

    "summary": "We already know the changes coming to our phones with iOS 26, but we're super excited to see what Apple's newest iPhone 17 lineup will look like. That's still more than a month away — assuming Apple sticks to its usual release schedule — so for now we can speculate what the new phones will look like. As with most unreleased iPhone models, rumors and leaks have trickled in about the hardware side ahead of the official introduction. Here's what we're expecting and what we can reasonably assume we'll get from Cupertino in September.\nWhat are the latest iPhone 17 rumors and reports?\nSurprisingly, the latest rumor isn't about the actual iPhone 17 details themselves, but rather when they'll finally be showcased. MacRumors highlighted a story originally reported by iphone-ticker.de that the Apple iPhone 17 event could be Tuesday, September 9, according to information gleaned from German mobile phone providers. \nWhile the iPhone events typically take place around the second week of September, we won't know the actual date until Apple makes the official announcement.\nWhen will the iPhone 17 series be announced?\nMost years, the flagship smartphones are introduced in September. It's a little early to have the specific dates; some years, Apple only gives a week or two of lead time between sending invites and hosting the event. But years of past precedent show that sometime in September should be when the 17 models make their debut. This family of smartphones may be the last to follow that trend, however. There have been hints that the introduction of the iPhone 18 collection in 2026 will be split into a pro-tier announcement in the fall and a standard model announcement the following spring.\nWhat will the new iPhone 17 lineup include?\nDesign leaks suggest that Apple is building an ultra-thin smartphone, likely to be named the iPhone 17 Air to match Apple's ultralight laptop designation. Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, often a solid source of advanced intel about Apple, reported in January that the iPhone 17 Air will be equipped with a basic A19 chip and will only have a single camera lens. It may also use Apple's new in-house modem, which was introduced in February on the iPhone 16e. More details about this development may leak ahead of September, but that's what we know for now.\nAn investor note from Apple analyst Jeff Pu indicated that the Air will have a titanium frame. If his reports are accurate, the lightweight smartphone will be the only entry in the iPhone 17 lineup to use that metal; the iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone 17 Pro Max are expected to be made of aluminum, which is oddly a lighter material than titanium. Other speculation had suggested that the Air would use a blend of aluminum and titanium, so the exact materials may not be known until the official announcement.\nAdditionally, an August 4 MacRumors report says the internal battery pack of the iPhone Air is just 2.49mm thick — half the thickness of the iPhone 17 Pro battery. The leak was posted on the Korean-langauge Naver blog, where they show the alleged batteries of the iPhone 17 Air and 17 Pro side by side. The same account claimed the 17 Air's battery capacity was a mere 2,800 mAh, MacRumors notes. (That's below the battery capacity of current iPhone 16 models.)\nEach new roster includes a base model, but over the years, Apple has shaken up the variety of phones it offers. Most likely there will be an iPhone 17 and an iPhone 17 Pro. Apple has also committed to the size matters philosophy, and has been building an iPhone Pro Max option with an even bigger screen and better battery life; the 17 roster will almost certainly have one as well. \nThe new Pro iPhones are said to have a full-width \"camera island\" on the rear, which would mark the first time an Apple model opted for that design. This feature can be seen in the purported iPhone 17 \"spotted in the wild.\" The pics, highlighted on MacRumors, show a black cased iPhone (17 Pro?) with the distinct back panel. Is it the real deal? The dual angles lend a degree of credibility in a social media landscape increasingly polluted with AI-enhanced fakes, but your guess is as good as ours.\nI just spotted a test development iPhone in the wild 🤩🤩🤩 pic.twitter.com/iS3PtKWqxJ— Fox Pupy 🦊🧡 (@Skyfops) July 28, 2025\n\nThe iPhone 17 Air seems primed to take the place of a potential iPhone 17 Plus. Since the iPhone 16e was only just introduced in February at a surprisingly high price point, it seems unlikely that there will be a new addition to that lower end of the spectrum, the models that were previously called SE. \nAt the very least, it sounds like the iPhone 17 Air won't take away the charging port and rely only on wireless connectivity. Bloomberg said that while Apple had investigated making the iPhone 17 Air without a single port, the company (fortunately) changed plans. He also says that the rumored phone will have a 6.6-inch screen and include the Dynamic Island and Camera Control button. Finally, the price is rumored at $900 — likely more than the standard iPhone 17 but less than the Pro.\nWe've also gotten what seems to be a reliable look at what the color lineup will be for the new smartphones. Macworld reported that the iPhone 17 will be available in black, white, steel gray, green, purple and light blue. The iPhone 17 Air will reportedly have four color options: black, white, light blue and light gold. While the Air colors will be less saturated, the visuals for the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max will go bold. The options for the Pro models are expected to be black, white, gray, dark blue and orange.\nOn July 30, Tom's Guide highlighted an X post from Sonny Dickson — a longtime and generally reliable leaker of unreleased iPhone information — showing \"dummy\" iPhone 17 models in the new colors that were the source of the aforementioned Macworld story. While these are literally just mock-ups — not real, leaked iPhones — it's interesting to see how the design and color rumors translate into a real-world look and feel.\nWhat will iOS 26 be like?\nApple upended its numbering conventions with WWDC 2025, and will match the name of each new operating system to the year it's released. So when the next wave of iPhones hits, they'll be running on iOS 26.\nOn the design side, the smartphone OS introduced during the big developer showcase took a contentious approach dubbed Liquid Glass. Apple has been scaling down the amount of transparency effects in the subsequent beta tests of iOS 26, but it will still have a glass-like visual.\nThe feature list includes big and small updates. On the more impactful side, the Phone and Photos apps have been redesigned. There will be several features leveraging artificial intelligence, such as live translation capabilities coming to Phone, FaceTime and Messages. Apple is also currently testing a sensitive content warning for child accounts that will freeze FaceTime video if nudity is detected by on-device machine learning tools. And the company is also launching Visual Intelligence, which will use AI to search for elements in an image.\niOS 26 also has a litany of minor, quality of life improvements. Group texts are getting support for polls. And for the slow risers out there, iOS 26 will finally let you escape the tyranny of the nine minute snooze alarm. \nThe next iOS is now available as a public beta. Here are our initial impressions of the Liquid Glass design and other new features. iOS 26 is compatible with all models back through iPhone 11.\nUpdate, August 6, 2025, 4:05PM ET: Added latest details about the potential iPhone 17 event date.\nUpdate, August 4, 2025, 5:23PM ET: Added latest battery leaks about the iPhone 17 models.\nUpdate, August 1, 2025, 8:15AM ET: Added new photos showing potential iPhone 17 colors.\nUpdate, July 30, 2025, 11:08AM ET: Added latest leaks and rumors about the iPhone 17, and updated information on the iOS 26 public beta.\nUpdate, July 17, 2025, 4:40PM ET: Added latest information about iOS 26, possible materials for the Air, and the color options for the different models.\nUpdate, March 17, 2025, 2PM ET: Added details about the rumored price and features of the iPhone 17 Air.\nUpdate, April 11, 2025, 3:45PM ET: Added details from Front Page Tech's new video that claims to reveal details from a leaked iOS 19 build.\nKatie Teague contributed to this story.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/apple-iphone-17-event-release-date-launch-date-colors-and-everything-else-you-need-to-know-153024258.html?src=rss",

The company landed on Bubty and Ascen not only for what they bring separately but also for how they worked together — Upwork piloted the companies both individually and together. “We saw through the power of those pilots how impactful their technology was and how easy it was to basically snap together what each of them offers, along with our existing offering to deliver something very new and innovative in the market,” Brown added."

    "summary": "The tech company lost a massive privacy case involving the Flo app that has raised huge questions about how health apps are secretly being used.",
    "full_text": "A California jury ruled Wednesday that Meta broke state privacy laws by collecting data from the popular period-tracking app Flo, including private health data and pregnancy goals. The consolidated Flo lawsuit dates to 2021, when users of the Flo app accused major tech companies of harvesting their data and actions on the period-tracking app, which included personal profiles about their menstrual cycles, sexual activity, pregnancy history and a variety of other personal health information. This kit allowed Flo to send different types of user data to Facebook, including buttons users clicked and data they shared with the app. The jury agreed that Meta had intentionally eavesdropped on the plaintiffs when they had a reasonable expectation of privacy, and did not have consent to eavesdrop or record data in this way. User privacy is important to Meta, which is why we do not want health or other sensitive information and why our terms prohibit developers from sending any.\" Should you be worried about using the Flo app? Tracking periods on an app may not be the most efficient option, anyway. The good news is that when Flo settled in 2021, part of the bargain was to arrange an independent privacy review and require explicit consent when sharing data. But issues with data harvesting and sharing like this raise broader questions about how safe it is to use health apps if you're concerned with privacy. We've also covered ways to track menstrual cycles without relying on an app at all, so you have plenty of alternatives."

    "full_text": "But Google on Wednesday denied that’s the case, at least in aggregate. Instead, the search giant says that total organic click volume from its search engine to websites has been “relatively stable” year-over-year and that average click quality has slightly increased. That word “some” is doing heavy lifting here, as Google doesn’t share data about how many sites are gaining or losing. Google also allows users to interact with an AI chatbot for some queries. Yet Google denies that this is significantly reshaping the search landscape. Back in 2022, a Google exec even said that social sites like TikTok and Instagram were eating into Google’s core products, like Search and Maps. Google has also long been worried that Amazon.com had become people’s first stop for online shopping searches, and Reddit.com had become the first stop for researching topics of interest. The company only points out that when people click through on an AI response to the source, they’re more likely to dive deeper, so those clicks are more valuable. One recent study from Similarweb indicates that the number of news searches on the web resulting in zero clicks to news websites has grown from 56% (when Google launched AI Overviews in May 2024) to 69% as of May 2025. It’s as if Google wants publishers to believe not what their own eyes — and graphs and charts — tell them, but instead take comfort in the fact that Google still sends “billions of clicks to websites” every day, just as the post claims."

But like the app it sought to emulate, TeaOnHer contains security flaws of its own. TeaOnHer was uploaded to the iOS App Store by a developer named Newville Media Corporation. According to LinkedIn, the founder and CEO of this company is Xavier Lampkin. TechCrunch identified at least one TeaOnHer record associated with Lampkin’s own data. Along with its security flaws, the content portrayed within TeaOnHer is troubling in itself. While the app requests IDs and selfies from its users to verify their identities — a process that is not automatic — users can access a “guest” view of the app without signing in. Immediately upon opening “guest” view, TechCrunch saw several images of the same naked woman, posted under different names in a form of spam. Other posts share the photos and names of women, alongside comments calling them “easy,” or accusing them of spreading sexually transmitted infections."

This is the best discount we've seen on this particular model.\nThe Vis Nav made our list of the best robot vacuums. This was primarily based on the item's superior suction power, especially when compared to rival units. We said it had the strongest suction power of any robovac we've tested and made short work out of dog hair stuck to carpeted floors. We noted that the suction power is on par with the company's stick vacuums in our official review. \n \nThe unit also boasts a fantastic obstacle avoidance system, thus the 360 in the name. Cameras and LED lights help the vacuum navigate around things like furniture. It doesn't fully avoid crashing into a chair leg once in a while, but we found that this happened rarely. We also never got any alerts that the robot got stuck somewhere while working.\nThe bin here is on the larger side, but this unit is missing some key features found with other pricey robot vacuums. This is a really good vacuum and nothing else. It's not a hybrid unit, so there's no mopping functionality. It also lacks a self-emptying base.\nDyson is also selling the V8 Absolute stick vacuum for $360, which is a discount of $160. The 15s Detect Submarine Absolute wet and dry vacuum is on sale for $800, which represents $200 in savings.

    "summary": "Key sections of the US Constitution were temporarily removed from Congress' website. Provisions including habeas corpus (due process) and the prohibition of nobility titles (like, say, King) vanished from the digital version of the document. They've since been restored. 404 Media first reported on the edits after users on Lemmy forums spotted them.\nThere are many ways to read a copy of the US Constitution. But the Library of Congress' online version is one of the easiest to find. Alongside its counterpart hosted by the National Archives, it's an official digital communication from the government. Those two websites also sit atop Google's search results for \"US Constitution.\"\nSo, when key sections vanish from the website, it's worth noting. And when they coincide with those that the Trump administration has said it wants to remove, it's a bit more eyebrow-raising.\nPortions of Section 8 of Article I, along with all of Sections 9 and 10 of Article I, were missing. \"The Privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended\" was part of that. Also gone was \"No Title of Nobility shall be granted by the United States.\" Ditto for the provision banning foreign emoluments for US officials.\nThe Lemmy thread that first caught the changes includes the complete list of edits. The National Archives version wasn't edited.\n404 Media notes that, before these edits, the website hadn't changed significantly since first being archived by the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine. (That archive goes back to 2019.) The US Constitution hasn't changed since 1992.\nBluesky\nThe Library of Congress said it was a mistake. \"It has been brought to our attention that some sections of Article 1 are missing from the Constitution Annotated (constitution.congress.gov) website,\" the official account posted on Bluesky. \"We've learned that this is due to a coding error. We have been working to correct this and expect it to be resolved soon.\" It was changed back sometime around 2PM ET on Wednesday.\nThe Trump administration doesn't have official control over the Library of Congress, which runs the website. But in May, the president fired Librarian of Congress Carla Hayden. (White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt claimed she \"did not fit the needs of the American people.\") Trump then named Todd Blanche, one of his former defense lawyers, as acting Librarian of Congress. The Senate must confirm a permanent replacement.\nThis isn't the first time official government websites have removed text that the Trump administration finds inconvenient. In March, The NY Times listed hundreds of words the administration removed from public-facing websites and other materials. They include terms like \"activism,\" \"disability,\" \"equality,\" \"female,\" \"prejudice,\" \"pollution,\" \"racism,\" \"sex,\" \"transgender\" and \"women.\" (\"Men\" wasn't on the list of banned words.)\nOf course, deleting text from the website doesn't change the legally binding document. (\"You realize that they still exist even if you don't post them, right?\" Jehosaphat Q. Blatte snarked on Bluesky.) But given the current state of affairs, you may want to look elsewhere to bone up on your rights.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/sections-on-habeas-corpus-and-nobility-titles-were-temporarily-removed-from-congress-us-constitution-website-182956441.html?src=rss",

Both companies’ launches come amid concerns that AI chatbots undermine the learning process because they spit out direct answers. The new tools from Google and OpenAI likely aim to address these concerns by positioning their chatbots as learning tools rather than simple answer engines. With Guided Learning, Gemini will break down problems step-by-step and adapt explanations to its users’ needs.

    "full_text": "If you're on a personal fitness journey, finding the best ways to lose weight and build muscle isn't easy. \"The purpose of vibration plates is to generate quick vibrations that cause your body's muscles to contract and relax several times per second,\" says Dr. Leah Verebes, a physical therapist and assistant professor at Touro University's School of Health Sciences. \"At a far greater frequency, this resembles the spontaneous contractions that take place during exercise.\" There are several ways to use a vibration plate, the most common being standing on its rectangular platform. However, experts agree that vibration plates offer the most benefits when used as part of an overall health and wellness plan. In other words, you shouldn't expect to lose weight or increase muscle strength just by standing on a vibration plate -- even if social media makes it seem so. \"You're going to experience much more muscle activation when doing it on a vibration plate machine.\" Scoot forward until you're hovering in front of the platform, only supported by your arms and legs. While it's true that vibration plates offer some compelling benefits, they aren't a shortcut to fitness. Experts also recommend following a healthy diet and participating in other forms of exercise to get the best results from vibration plate training."

    "full_text": "For me, watching Freakier Friday -- the new sequel to the 2003 body-switch comedy starring Lindsay Lohan and Jamie Lee Curtis -- led to a change in perspective: I was now a fan of two Freaky Friday movies headlined by Lohan and Curtis. From Curtis' nostalgic and still-hilarious portrayal of waking up as a 15-year-old inhabiting her step-grandmother's body to entertaining scenes with a job-switching fortune teller (Saturday Night Live alum Vanessa Bayer), the sequel offers wacky and laugh-out-loud moments. It wouldn't work without the commitment of its stars, Curtis and Lohan. Harper and Lily's status as mortal enemies complicates the soon-to-be blended family. When inevitable fortune-teller meddling and body-swapping occurs -- Lily switches with Tess and mother Anna trades places with daughter Harper -- the teens realize they can use their new bodies to break up their parents. Anna doesn't fully accept the relationship between her mom and soon-to-be stepdad. It takes body-switching for Anna and Tess to appreciate what they had been missing about each other. In Freakier Friday, being a teenager is depicted in a cringier light, from bedroom door notices that say \"no triggering\" to gluten-free requirements at high-school bake sales. However, the movie packs in copious cameos -- bringing back virtually every supporting character from the first movie -- an element I found kind of tiring. Curtis doesn't shy away from jokes at her expense; one scene where she reluctantly grabs items from the \"senior supplies\" section of a store is particularly memorable."

    "full_text": "As long as you're looking at the night sky, August has a ton of cool stuff going on this year. According to The Old Farmer's Almanac, the full moon will reach its peak brightness at 3:55 a.m. Thus, if you want to see the moon at its brightest, you'll want to look up the evening of Aug. 8 and on into the next morning. It's not a big deal if you miss it, as the moon will be over 90% full from Aug. 6 through Aug. 11, so you'll have plenty of chances to look up and see it. Venus and Jupiter don't make an appearance until much later in the evening, but they'll be visible with the naked eye. The other three will require some sort of magnification. The Perseids meteor shower is also active, so you may spy a shooting star or two, depending on how dark it is outside. According to The Old Farmer's Almanac, sturgeon were a staple food for Native Americans in the Great Lakes region, and the fish used to be a lot more abundant during mid- to late summer. Thus, scholars often refer to the fish as a living fossil. It's also a long-lived fish, with an average lifespan of 50 to 60 years."

    "summary": "After largely focusing Google I/O 2025 on the ways the company wants Gemini to change everything from searching the web to filmmaking, Google is finally ready to launch new hardware. The next Made by Google event is on the books for August 20, and Google has already confirmed what at least one of its new Pixel 10 phones will look like.\nGoogle remains as leak-prone as ever, so nearly all the new hardware the company is expected to announce has all ready been reported on in one form or another. With that in mind and after sifting through what has leaked, here's what Google will show off at the Pixel 10 launch even in New York City on August 20.\nPixel 10, 10 Pro, 10 Pro XL and 10 Pro Fold\nAndroid Headlines / Onleaks \nGoogle's invitation for the event says that the company is sharing \"the latest on our Pixel phones, watches, buds and more,” which more or less confirms the company will introduce a slate of products that's similar to what it launched in 2024. That means a Pixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro, Pixel 10 Pro XL and Pixel 10 Pro Fold are absolutely on the menu.\nGoogle's tease of the Pixel 10 confirmed what leaked renders have already signaled: the company isn't abandoning the new design language the Pixel 9 established. The pill-shaped camera bump and flat front display will still be present on the Pixel 10, and the real changes will be in the details, like for example, how the flat sides of the Pixel 10 join with the phone's back.\nThose subtle changes will apparently also include the thickness of the Pixel 10s. While both the Pixel 10, 10 Pro, 10 Pro XL and 10 Pro Fold will use the same sized OLED screens as their Pixel 9 counterparts, they'll be housed in thicker and heavier bodies, according to Android Headlines. Google's new Pixels are also supposed to come in new colors. The Pixel 10 will come in \"Frost\" (a royal blue), \"Lemongrass\" (a yellow), \"Indigo\" (a light purple) and \"Obsidian\" (a dark gray), while the Pixel 10 Pro / Pro XL will come in Obsidian, \"Porcelain\" (off-white), \"Moonstone\" (a bluish gray) and \"Jade\" (a light green). Less information is known about the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, though recent leaks suggest it'll come in Moonstone and Jade, as well.\nAndroid Headlines\nThe most visible external change that'll be introduced on the Pixel 10 is the addition of a new telephoto camera. The new telephoto camera is a 11-megapixel 5x telephoto, Android Authority reports, similar to the one on the Pixel 9 Pro Fold. Meanwhile, the Pixel 10 Pro and 10 Pro XL are expected to feature a 50-megapixel wide, 48-megapixel ultrawide, 48-megapixel telephoto and 48-megapixel selfie cameras. The Pixel 10 Pro Fold could feature a different lineup, with a similar main camera, but 12-megapixel ultrawide and telephoto cameras, and 11-megapixel selfie cameras.\nInside the new phones, Google is laying the groundwork for future performance gains with a new Tensor G5 chip. It's likely be much more power-efficient thanks to the company switching to a 3nm design produced by TSMC. Reports suggest the chip might not be all that different in terms of raw power, but the Tensor G5 is likely designed to be extra capable when it comes to using local AI features.\nAs far as timing goes, it's worth noting that the latest rumors indicate that the Pixel 10, 10 Pro and 10 Pro XL will be available about a week after the event, on August 28. But the Pixel 10 Pro Fold (as well as the Pixel Watch 4 and Pixel Buds 2a aren't expected for more than a month after that. Those devices are rumored to be on sale as of October 9.\nWhile global tariff turmoil could justify a price increase, Google is reportedly keeping things consistent with the Pixel 10 family. They'll offer similar storage options, come in at the same prices and include the same freebies and incentives. The Pixel 10 will come with six months of Google AI Pro and Fitbit Premium, along with three months of YouTube Premium. Meanwhile the Pixel 10 Pro models will get a year of Google AI Pro, six months of Fitbit Premium and three months of YouTube Premium. The prices and storage options for the phones should breakout down as follows:\n\nPixel 10: 128GB ($799), 256GB ($899)\nPixel 10 Pro: 128GB ($999), 256GB ($1,099), 512GB ($1,219), 1TB ($1,449)\nPixel 10 Pro XL: 256GB ($1,199), 512GB ($1,319), 1TB ($1,549)\nPixel 10 Pro Fold: 256GB ($1,799), 512GB ($1,919), 1TB ($2,149)\n\nPixel Watch 4\n91mobiles / Onleaks\nThe third time was the charm for the Pixel Watch 3, so the main task Google has with the Pixel Watch 4 is to not squander the solid base it already has. Leaks for the company's new smartwatches have been limited so far, but renders of the Pixel Watch 4 shared by 91mobiles do suggest Google has a few changes planned.\nNamely, much like the company's phones, the new Pixel Watch seems like it'll be a little bit thicker and come with smaller bezels. The Pixel Watch 4 should be available to purchase in the same 41mm and 45mm sizes as before, but in new colors — including a Moonstone option to match the Pixel 10 — and with a brighter display.\nThe thicker frame will also help the smartwatch fit a larger battery and a new wireless charging system, according to Android Headlines. Rather than charge through a puck with pogo pins like the Pixel Watch 3, the Pixel Watch 4 will use a wireless charging stand that could fill it up even faster.\nBeyond that, Google has already indicated how Wear OS is evolving. The new Wear OS 6 update is debuting on the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8, and will presumably be available on the Pixel Watch 4 at launch. It includes built-in access to Gemini, among other tweaks. Given Google also manages the Fitbit Premium subscription, it wouldn't be all that surprising if the Pixel Watch 4 gets some exclusive fitness tracking features, too.\nPixel Buds 2a\nBilly Steele for Engadget\nGoogle launched the Pixel Buds Pro 2 last year, and it typically doesn't update its premium earbuds on a yearly cadence. So instead, Tom's Guide reports Google might pair the Pixel 10 with the Pixel Buds Pro 2 in a new color, and save its new hardware announcements for a sequel to the Pixel Buds A-series called the Pixel Buds 2a.\nUnlike the company's premium wireless earbuds, the A-series Pixel Buds have historically skimped on things like active noise cancellation to hit a lower price. There's little reporting on where Google will take the Pixel Buds 2a, but you can expect the new earbuds to come in some of the new colors being introduced on the Pixel 10.\nPixelsnap\nThe Qi2 wireless charging standard is available for all phone makers to use, but it hasn't been widely adopted among Android phone makers. Qi2 uses magnets to offer improved charging speeds, just like Apple's MagSafe, and the Pixel 10 could mark Google's adoption of Qi2 through a new feature called \"Pixelsnap.\"\nA report from Android Authority suggests the Pixel 10 will include the necessary magnets to make Qi2 happen, and will be introduced alongside a lineup of Pixelsnap accessories. New leaked images showing a Pixel 10 charging with a magnetic charging puck that looks a lot like Apple's MagSafe charger adds even more credence to the rumor.\nIf you need even more convincing, the Wireless Power Consortium has announced that its faster Qi2 25W charging is coming to \"major Android phones.\" It would make sense if Google's Pixel 10s were included considering runs Android itself.\nGemini and other exclusive software features\nGemini is Google's current favorite, and the company is pushing the AI assistant everywhere it makes sense. The last few Pixel Drops — Google's regular Pixel-focused software updates — have primarily included Gemini features. It would make sense for Google to include a few more software exclusives on the Pixel 10.\nGoogle is hosting the Pixel 10 launch event on August 20 at 1PM ET / 10AM ET. The company has invited press to attend in person, and you can read coverage of everything Google announces right here on Engadget.\nUpdate, August 6, 12:15PM ET: Added information about the timeline for when Google's new hardware is expected to arrive.\nUpdate, July 30, 2:30PM ET: Added information on pricing for the Pixel 10 lineup and new details on Qi2 support.\nUpdate, July 24, 3:44PM ET: Added details on the Pixel Watch 4's display, new colors and charging stand.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/google-pixel-10-launch-new-phones-foldables-and-watches-at-the-made-by-google-event-214510624.html?src=rss",

The report suggests that the country has been shuttling these recordings to Microsoft Azure cloud servers.\nCompany CEO Satya Nadella allegedly okayed the effort personally after meeting with a commander from Israel’s military surveillance agency, Unit 8200. He reportedly gave the country a customized and segregated area within the Azure platform to store millions of phone calls made each day without knowledge or consent from Palestinians.\nAccording to sources within Unit 8200, these recordings have assisted in the preparation of deadly airstrikes and helped shape military operations throughout the region. Israel has long been intercepting calls in the occupied territories, as it basically controls the entire Palestinian telecommunications infrastructure.\nThis new method, however, reportedly captures the conversations of a large pool of regular civilians. The mantra when building out the project was to record \"a million calls an hour.\" Leaked Microsoft files suggest that the lion's share of this data is being stored in Azure facilities in the Netherlands and Ireland.\nMicrosoft has been facing increased scrutiny regarding its role in Israel's 22-month offensive in Gaza.

    "full_text": "A new startup, Lava Payments, aims to take on payment giants by building a solution for the modern web where AI agents now handle transactions for their customers. “I kept running into the same issue,” he told TechCrunch. Lava is a digital wallet that lets merchants use usage credits to facilitate transactions. The idea is that one set of credits working across merchants and services makes it easier for autonomous agents to make payments without needing human intervention. So, rather than having to pay for each tool, a user buys a one-time usage credit that AI agents can simply charge as they perform various tasks. “Without Lava, agents can’t move smoothly through the internet because they constantly get blocked when it comes time to pay,” he said. On Wednesday, the startup announced a $5.8 million seed round led by Lerer Hippeau. “We see the world as very interconnected,” Jones said about what makes his product different. “What we’re really focused on is building [for the] agent-native economy.” “We want to make sure that AI is something that can be used by every single person, even a kid from Dayton, like myself.”"

    "full_text": "Several sections of Article 1 of the U.S. Constitution appear to have been removed from the official U.S. government website, as pointed out by sleuths on the internet and as seen by TechCrunch. Several Reddit threads identified the changes in Article 1 of the U.S. Constitution: Large parts of Section 8 have been removed, and Sections 9 and 10 have been deleted altogether. These sections largely relate to the powers that Congress has and does not have, as well as limitations on the powers of individual states. The removal includes sections relating to habeas corpus, the powers that protect citizens from unlawful detention. Some of the sections’ text appears to be missing, as indicated by a trailing semicolon at the end of Section 8, where text used to follow. In a tweet posted on Wednesday, the Library of Congress said the sections were missing “due to a coding error” and expect it to be “resolved soon.” When contacted by TechCrunch, a spokesperson for the Library of Congress did not say what caused the coding error, or how it was introduced. Changing the U.S. Constitution’s text on the website does not change or have any effect on U.S. law, but it nevertheless follows senior Trump administration official Stephen Miller’s threats earlier this year to suspend habeas corpus. When reached by TechCrunch, White House spokesperson Davis Ingle declined to comment beyond the Library of Congress’ post. Large sections of the U.S. Constitution were removed from the U.S. government’s official page Image Credits:TechCrunch (screenshot) Updated with more details from the Library of Congress, and with a response from the White House."

    "full_text": "Ahead of his talk, Deibert told TechCrunch that he plans to speak about what he describes as a “descent into a kind of fusion of tech and fascism,” and the role that the Big Tech platforms are playing, and “propelling forward a really frightening type of collective insecurity that isn’t typically addressed by this crowd, this community, as a cybersecurity problem.” Earlier this year, President Donald Trump ordered an investigation into former CISA director Chris Krebs, who had publicly rebuffed Trump’s false claims about election fraud by declaring the 2020 election secure. Easterly was herself a victim of political pressure from the Trump administration when her offer to join West Point was rescinded in late July. Deibert is also concerned that big companies like Meta, Google, and Apple could take a step back in their efforts to fight against government spyware — sometimes referred to as “commercial” or “mercenary” spyware — by gutting their threat intelligence teams. These threat intelligence teams are dedicated groups of security researchers that track government hackers, both those working inside government agencies, such as China’s Ministry of State Security or Russia’s intelligence agencies FSB and GRU, and companies such as NSO Group or Paragon. These are the same teams that are responsible for detecting hacks against their own users, such as when WhatsApp caught NSO Group hacking more than 1,400 of its users in 2019, or when Apple caught hackers using government spyware to target its customers and notified the victims of the attacks. Deibert believes there is a “huge market failure when it comes to cybersecurity for global civil society,” a part of the population that generally cannot afford to get help from big security companies that typically serve governments and corporate clients. “This market failure is going to get more acute as supporting institutions evaporate and attacks on civil society amplify,” he said. Deibert is concerned that these threat intelligence teams could be cut or at least reduced, given that the same companies have cut their moderation and safety teams. “But the question is how long will that last?” said Deibert."

The tech giant is set to announce Wednesday another $100 billion in spending to help boost production of its products here in the U.S., after previously committing to invest $500 billion in the country over the next four years. The $500 billion commitment includes opening a new advanced manufacturing facility in Houston to produce servers that support Apple Intelligence, producing Apple TV+ productions in 20 U.S. states, and working with U.S. suppliers. The news comes as President Trump has threatened the iPhone maker with tariffs unless it moves more of its manufacturing from Asia to the United States. Apple, which mainly manufactures its devices in India, China, and Vietnam, has already been affected by tariffs. The company incurred $800 million in tariff-related costs during June and expects to spend $1.1 billion in the next quarter, CEO Tim Cook said during an earnings call last month."

The changes arrive amid a mixed quarter for the dating app giant, which reported flat year-over-year revenue of $864 million and earnings that declined from $133.3 million year-over-year to $122.5 million in Q2. Match also announced it would invest $50 million in product development, as the dating app maker aims to connect with younger Gen Z users and use AI to improve its products. “We’re on track to test version one of a redesigned ‘see who likes you’ tab this fall with the goal of helping users connect with people they’re more likely to be interested in, as well as to drive more revenue,” he added. In the case of the latter, Tinder continues to experiment with AI-powered matching, which it debuted in New Zealand earlier this year. “The interactive matching experience we’ve been testing in New Zealand is specifically designed to appeal to this type of audience [users under 30]: Somebody who doesn’t just want to be judged based on their physical appearance. The company also offered an update on Tinder’s Double Date option, launched in June, that lets users pair up with a friend to match with another couple. This was Rascoff’s first full quarter at the helm of Match Group, as the Zillow Group co-founder and Match board member was appointed CEO in February.

    "summary": "Thirteen years ago, the Curiosity rover landed on Mars, inside Gale crater in particular. It was originally sent to the red planet for a two-year mission, but it was extended indefinitely just a few months into its operations. The rover has several goals, most of which are meant to help scientists determine whether Mars could ever have supported life in the past. And while it's still very much operational and doing science, NASA has had to make adjustments and give it new capabilities to ensure that it can keep running. \nIn a new post celebrating the 13th anniversary of the rover's landing, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory has detailed the updates the Curiosity team has had to implement. To start with, the team manages the rover's daily power budget with great care to make sure it can do its job and last longer. See, Curiosity uses a power system called Multi-Mission Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator (MMRTG), which relies on decaying plutonium pellets to generate energy. As the plutonium decays over time, it takes longer and longer for the system to recharge the rover's battery. \nThat's why the team now meticulously factors in every device that draws on the batteries. They consolidate Curiosity's tasks to shorten the time the rover is active to also reduce the energy used. The ground team, for instance, tells Curiosity to talk to an orbiter while driving or moving its robotic arm instead of doing one task at a time. If the rover finishes its tasks early, it can go to sleep early and recharge for the next day, which JPL says maximizes the life of the MMRTG. \nOver the past years, NASA has also rolled out updates to change how the rover's robotic arm drill collects samples and to improve its driving capabilities. JPL developed an algorithm to reduce wear on the rover's wheels, as well, so they can last longer. \nFrom the time Curiosity had landed on Mars, it has provided us with multiple discoveries and new information. It discovered organic molecules in Martian atmosphere and soil, detected \"startlingly high\" levels of methane that's a gas typically produced by life as we know it, and it found evidence of ancient megafloods on the red planet. And water, as you know, could indicate the presence of life. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/science/space/nasa-explains-how-it-keeps-the-curiosity-rover-running-13-years-later-124530184.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Every now and then companies make truly boneheaded decisions, which is exactly what happened when Dell killed off the name of its most iconic PC line and replaced it with something generic. It's like if Ford decided to rebrand Mustang and call it The Prime Sportscar instead. It doesn't make sense. But now that XPS has become Premium, it's time to see if Dell's latest flagship 14-inch ultraportable — the Dell 14 Premium (you see how dumb that sounds?) — still has the DNA that made its predecessors one of the best notebook families for more than a decade.\nDesign and display: How Dell puts the P in Premium\nInstead of doing a full redesign to match its updated name, for 2025 Dell kept the same chassis it used on last year's XPS 14. And I'm not mad at all because it's still one of the most beautiful and elegant notebooks on the market today. Its aluminum chassis has clean lines, a Gorilla Glass 3 surface and just the right amount of ports for a laptop this size: three USB-C slots with Thunderbolt 4, a 3.5mm audio jack and a microSD slot. That's important, because the 14 Premium's smaller sibling — the XPS 13 (which isn’t being renamed yet because it isn't getting updated this year) — doesn't have a headphone jack or a built-in card reader. That said, at between 3.66 and 3.79 pounds depending on which display you pick, the 14 Premium is a touch heavier than some of its similarly-sized rivals like a 14-inch MacBook Pro (3.4 pounds). The difference is small enough that I'm not bothered, though. \n \nThere's also a glass wrist rest with a touchpad that blends invisibly into the deck, which might make it seem potentially hard to use. However, because the tracking area is absolutely massive (it spans the entire area below the spacebar plus the right ALT and Copilot keys), I never felt cramped or like I needed to actively search for my cursor. I also appreciate how Dell found room for speakers on either side of the keyboard.\nOn the other hand, Dell's touch buttons above the number row may be a bit more contentious. I don't mind the ones for adjusting volume and display brightness, but replacing the physical keys for Escape and Delete with the touchscreen options just feels a bit weird. Especially if you ever need to use the classic Windows CTRL + ALT + DEL shortcut and have to press regular keys and touch controls in a single motion. The touch keys also don't turn off when you disable the keyboard's backlight, but at least they're dim enough that they're not distracting.\n\n\n\n\n   Sam Rutherford for Engadget \n \n\nAs for its display, by default the 14 Premium comes with a 14.5-inch 2K 120Hz non-touch IPS display. However, on our review unit, I've been using Dell's optional 3.2K 120Hz touch OLED panel and I must say, it's definitely worth the $200 upcharge. That's because while the OLED screen has slightly lower max brightness (400 nits versus 500 nits for the IPS), its wider color gamut and improved contrast ratio more than make up for that shortcoming.\nPerformance: Not the most up-to-date, but still very versatile\nA base Dell 14 Premium comes with an Intel Core Ultra 7 255H CPU, 16GB of RAM and 512GB of M.2 storage. However, our review unit includes extra memory (32GB), a bigger SSD (1TB) and perhaps most importantly, an optional NVIDIA RTX 4050 GPU.\n\n\n\n\n   Sam Rutherford for Engadget \n \n\nAll told, that's a pretty well-rounded package, as Dell's default config has more than enough performance to handle pretty much any level of regular productivity. And by adding in support for discrete graphics, suddenly you have a machine that's significantly better equipped to take care of more demanding tasks like video editing or even gaming in your off hours. Granted, the 14 Premium's RTX 4050 card is an entry-level component that recently became a generation old, but it was strong enough to hit 60 fps in Cyberpunk 2077 at 1080p on high settings (with DLSS set to balanced), which ain't too shabby considering its portability.\nBattery life: Good enough\n\n\n\n\n   Sam Rutherford for Engadget \n \n\nThe Dell 14 Premium packs good but not outstanding battery life thanks to its 69.5WHr power pack. On PCMark10's Modern Office rundown test, it lasted 8 hours and 30 minutes on the dot That’s significantly longer than ASUS' ROG Z Flow 13 (6:54) and last year's Razer Blade 14 (6:46), but still a far cry from true power-sipping systems like the ASUS Zenbook 14 OLED (12:43) or even Dell's own XPS 13 (13:15).\nWrap-up\nEven with a new and rather uninspired name, it probably shouldn't come as a surprise that the Dell 14 Premium remains one of the best Windows laptops on the market. It has the same sleek design from back when it was still called the XPS 14 but with some refreshed specs and components for 2025. Its chassis strikes a brilliant balance between modern minimalism and usability, while upgrades like its OLED display and discrete graphics give you the ability to build out a versatile but still very portable device.\n\n\n\n\n   Sam Rutherford for Engadget \n \n\nNow I admit that our fully loaded review unit is a bit pricey with a retail price of $2,450, though I'd be remiss to mention that Dell is currently running a sale that knocks $200 off that cost. Regardless, with the base model starting at $1,650 (before discounts) or $1,850 when paired with Dell's optional OLED panel (which everyone should at least consider), the 14 Premium still feels like a great deal. And when you consider that the XPS 13 isn't getting any updates this year on top of having fewer ports, the choice becomes even clearer. If I were going to spend my own money on a traditional Windows ultraportable laptop, this is the laptop I'd get.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/dell-premium-14-review-new-name-same-great-laptop-120047563.html?src=rss",
    "full_text": "But now that XPS has become Premium, it's time to see if Dell's latest flagship 14-inch ultraportable — the Dell 14 Premium (you see how dumb that sounds?) Instead of doing a full redesign to match its updated name, for 2025 Dell kept the same chassis it used on last year's XPS 14. That's important, because the 14 Premium's smaller sibling — the XPS 13 (which isn’t being renamed yet because it isn't getting updated this year) — doesn't have a headphone jack or a built-in card reader. That said, at between 3.66 and 3.79 pounds depending on which display you pick, the 14 Premium is a touch heavier than some of its similarly-sized rivals like a 14-inch MacBook Pro (3.4 pounds). I also appreciate how Dell found room for speakers on either side of the keyboard. That's because while the OLED screen has slightly lower max brightness (400 nits versus 500 nits for the IPS), its wider color gamut and improved contrast ratio more than make up for that shortcoming.

The company managed to build a trio charger that works well as a permanent fixture on your bedside table or desk, as well as a compact portable charging station. As the former, it takes up very little space when fully setup, and the magnetic phone charger can be tilt-adjusted up to 70 degrees so you can get the right viewing angle if you’re watching videos on your iPhone while charging. The Apple Watch charging pad is similarly adjustable, and the space that wirelessly powers up AirPods or other earbuds sits right in front of that. The design is clever and feels premium without being too heavy, and I appreciate the soft-touch accents throughout. There are also four rubberized feet on the bottom so the device is less likely to move around or fall over when perched on a table. Plus, UGreen includes a USB-C to C cable and a 30W adapter in the box, so you’re given everything the station needs to power up all your devices as quickly as possible."

    "summary": "To find the best power bank out there, I tested around 50 portable chargers and batteries from big brands — Anker, Belkin, UGreen, Mophie — as well as some smaller players like Lion Energy, Nimble and Satechi. I used them to recharge a number of devices including iPhones, Galaxy phones, an iPad, a MacBook and even my ereaders and PlayStation controller. If you just want a brick that can charge anything, go for Anker’s 25kmAh Laptop Power bank. It has two built-in USB-C cables, a massive capacity and super fast charging speeds. But if that’s not quite what you’re looking for, you can check out ten more of the best power banks below.Editor’s note: Anker recently issued two recalls, one for its PowerCore 10000 power bank (model A1263) and another for multiple power banks (model numbers A1647, A1652, A1257, A1681 and A1689). All recalls are due to a potential fire risk in the lithium-ion cells. If you have one of these batteries, visit Anker’s recall page for the next steps. None of the batteries we currently recommend are part of the recall, and we haven’t recommended these specific models in previous iterations of this guide.\nTable of contents\n\nBest power banks for 2025\nHow we test best power banks\nWhat to look for in a portable battery pack\nOther power banks we tested\nPower bank FAQs\n\nBest power banks for 2025\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhat to look for in a portable battery pack\nBattery type\nNearly every rechargeable power bank you can buy (and most portable devices) contain a lithium-ion battery. These beat other current battery types in terms of size-to-charge capacity, and have even increased in energy density by eight fold in the past 14 years. They also don’t suffer from a memory effect (where a battery's lifespan deteriorates due to partial charges). \nFlying with portable batteries\nYou may have heard about lithium ion batteries overheating and catching fire — a recent Hong Kong flight was grounded after just such a thing happened in an overhead bin. Current restrictions implemented by the TSA still allow external batteries rated at 100Wh or less (which all of our recommendations are) to fly with you, but only in your carry-on luggage — they can’t be checked.\nRecently, Southwest Airlines was the first in the industry to take that rule one step further. Now, flyers on that airline must keep power banks in clear view when using them to recharge a device. If the portable charger isn’t actively in use, however, it can stay in your carry-on bag in the overhead bin.\nCapacity\nPower bank manufacturers almost always list a battery’s capacity in milliamp hours, or mAh. Smaller batteries with a 5,000mAh capacity make good phone chargers and can fill a smartphone to between 50 and 75 percent. Larger batteries that can recharge laptops and tablets, or give phones multiple charges, can exceed 25,000mAh and we have a separate guide that covers that entire category. \nUnsurprisingly, the prices on most batteries goes up as mAh capacity increases, and since batteries are physical storage units, size and weight go up with capacity as well. If you want more power, be prepared to spend more and carry around a heavier brick.\nYou might think that a 10,000mAh power bank could charge a 5,000mAh phone to 100 percent twice, but that’s not the case. In addition to simple energy loss through heat dissipation, factors like voltage conversion also bring down the amount of juice that makes it into your phone. Most manufacturers list how many charges a battery can give a certain smartphone. In our tests, 10,000mAh of battery pack capacity translated to roughly 5,800mAh of device charge. 20,000mAh chargers delivered around 11,250mAh to a device, and 25,000mAh banks translated to about 16,200mAh of charge. That’s an average efficiency rate of around 60 percent.\nWireless\nMore manufacturers are making power banks with wireless charging. Not hassling with cables is nice, but it’s important to note that wireless charging is less efficient than plugging in your phone. Outside of MagSafe options, wireless portable chargers historically didn’t make the cut for our top picks for this guide for that reason. The Qi2 wireless charging standard arrived in 2023 and improves performance for wireless charging, including for portable banks. Currently, iPhones are the only handsets that support the new tech, but as it’s an open standard, expect Google, Samsung and others to adopt it for future phones. In my testing, I’ve noticed an uptick in the performance of non-Qi2-enabled batteries as well, so you'll now see wireless options on this list.\nPorts\nSince Apple ditched the Lightning cable and adopted USB-C, we’re getting closer to a standard for charging connections — and all of our picks have at least one such port. But plenty of other devices use older interfaces, like USB-A and microUSB ports, plus Lightning for older iPhones. You can find cables with just about any combination of those connections, so when you’re picking out a battery, just check that one end of your preferred cord will fit.\nMost battery packs have more than one charging port, which gives you different charging options. You’ll typically see at least one port labeled “in/out,” which means you can use it to both charge the bank and charge your gadget. While USB-A output ports can power up cell phones and other small devices, they can’t charge larger devices. Plus, they aren’t as fast as USB-C ports overall. That’s something to keep in mind when you’re deciding which ports and charging cables to use to connect your phone to the pack.\nThere’s even more variation among USB-C ports themselves, with different ports on the same device supporting different power transfer rates. What that means in practical terms is an iPhone will charge just fine plugged into a power bank’s 18W port. But to properly charge, say, a MacBook or similar laptop, it’ll need the extra juice supplied by a 100W port (which larger power banks can offer). Power banks with more than one port can also charge multiple devices at the same time, but speeds and the overall charge delivered will be lower.\nYou’ll also want to consider your charging cable. For anything larger than a smartphone (and to access fast-charging capabilities) you’ll want to use USB-C ports and cables. But not all cables are created equal, even when they have the same USB-C plugs on the end. If you want power delivery from a 100W USB-C power bank port, you’ll need a 100W-rated USB-C cable. Luckily, power banks capable of delivering 100W tend to include a compatible cable. For any devices that don’t, we’ve tried and liked Anker’s 100W USB-C cable. For smaller devices, we used this 60W cable from Nimble and we don’t recommend bothering with cables under 60W. For around $20, higher-capacity charging cables will make sure you’re not wasting time with connections that limit your potential power transfer.\nDesign\nFor the most part, these rechargeable batteries have a squared-off, brick-like design, though many nod towards aesthetics with attractive finishes and detailing. While that doesn’t affect how they perform, it’s a consideration for something you’ll interact with regularly. Some portable power stations include extra features like MagSafe compatibility, a built-in wall plug or even a kickstand. Nearly all have some sort of indicator to let you know how much available charge your power bank has left, usually expressed with lighted pips near the power button. Some of the newer banks take that a step further with an LED display indicating remaining battery percentage.\nHow we test best power banks\nBefore I even put my hands on a battery pack, I did extensive research. I considered brands Engadget reviewers and staff have tried over the years and checked out customer ratings on retail sites like Amazon and Best Buy. Then, I acquire the most promising candidates and test them in my home office.\n\n\n\n\n   Amy Skorheim for Engadget \n \n\nHere’s the full list of power banks we've tested, which range from small wireless banks to large, multi-device batteries:\nMagSafe-compatible\n\nApple MagSafe Battery Pack (5,000 mAh)\nSpigen ArcHybrid Mag (5,000mAh)\nAnker 521 Magnetic Battery (5,000 mAh)\nMophie snap+ PowerstationMmini (5,000mAh)\nBaseus Magnetic (10,000mAh)\nAnker MagGo Power Bank (6.6K) (6,600 mAh)\nAnker 633 Magnetic Battery (10,000mAh)\nAnker MagGo Power Bank (10K) (10,000 mAh)\nUGREEN 10,000mAh Magnetic (10,000mAh)\nEcoFlow Rapid Magnetic (5,000mAh) \n\nLow capacity (≤10,000mAh)\n\nMophie Juice Pack (2,400mAh)\nAnker 511 Power Bank (5,000 mAh)\nAnker 313 Power Bank (10,000mAh)\nNimble Champ (10,000mAh)\nBiolite Charge 40 PD (10,000mAh)\nAnker Nano (5,000mAh)\nNimble Champ (10,000mAh)\nSatechi Quatro Wireless bank (10,000mAh)\nAnker 10K Fusion power bank (10,000mAh)\n\nMid capacity (10,001 - 20,000mAh)\n\nBaseus Blade 2 (12,000 mAh)\nOtterbox Fast Charge (15,000mAh)\nMophie Powerstation Pro (20,000mAh)\nAnker Prime (20,000mAh)\nNestout Portable Charger (15,000mAh)\nNimble Champ Pro (20,000mAh)\nInfinaCore P3 Pro (10,500mAh)\n\nHigh capacity (20,001mAh+)\n\nMophie Powerstation Pro XL (25,000mAh)\nUGREEN Power Bank 25,000mAh 145W (25,000mAh)\nAnker 737 Power Bank (25,600 mAh)\nZendure Supertank Pro (26,800mAh)\nMophie Powerstation Pro AC (27,000mAh)\nLion Energy Eclipse Mag (27,000mAh)\nLion Energy Trek (27,000mAh)\nHyperJuice 245W (27,000mAh)\nAnker Prime 27,650mAh Power Bank (27,650mAh)\nAnker laptop power bank with built-in cable (25,000mAh)\nBelkin Boost Charge 20K with built-in cable (20,000mAh)\n\nWe're continuously updating this guide as companies release new products and we test them. We remove some products as we find picks that are more worthy of the best portable charger designation. We also add updated specs and prices where necessary. \nFor testing, I used each battery with some combination of an iPhone 15, an iPhone 14 Plus, an iPhone 11, a Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra, a Galaxy S23 Ultra, a 5th-gen iPad Air and an M1 Pro 16-inch MacBook Pro. I charged one phone battery at a time, even though some packs are capable of multiple-device charging. I charged the phones and tablets from between zero and five percent until they were 100 percent full (or until the power bank was dead), and didn’t use the phones or tablets while they charged other than to power them on and enter the unlock code. In the case of the MacBook, I used it while it was charging (it’s my work computer).\nI used the charging cable included with each power bank to charge the Galaxy S22 Ultra, MacBook Pro and the iPad Air. For the iPhones, I used the USB-C to Lighting cable that Apple provides. In the case of the lower-capacity power banks that didn’t include a cord or included one with USB-C to USB-A connectors, I used this 60W-rated USB-C to USB-C cable.\nFor reference, here are the battery capacities of each device we used for testing:\n\niPhone 11: 3,110 mAh\niPhone 14 Plus: 4,325 mAh\niPhone 15: 3,349 mAh\nGalaxy S22 Ultra: 4,855mAh\niPad Air: 7,729mAh\n16-inch M1 Pro MacBook Pro: 27,027mAh\n\nI noted the times for each charge and the number of charges each bank provided. I also paid attention to things like ease of use and overall design.\nOther power banks we tested\nHyperJuice 245W\nHyper’s massive-but-sleek brick is one nice looking power bank. The HyperJuice 245W packs a hefty 27,000mAh capacity, enough to refill my tester phone about four times and get a MacBook Pro from near-dead to 75 percent. It only has USB-C ports, but you at least get four of them. USB-C only is probably fine for most situations, but a USB-A port would be nice for charging the occasional older peripheral. The 245 wattage is pretty high for a power bank and it was indeed speedy. It filled a Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra in just over an hour. But it’s the same price and capacity as our Mophie Powerstation pick for laptop banks, and that one has a better variety of ports. Hyper’s battery is also comparable to Anker’s laptop battery, which is cheaper, has built-in cables and has nearly the same capacity. Plus, that bank is just as swanky looking.\nAnker Prime 20,000 mAh power bank\nAnker’s Prime bank was our previous pick for the best premium power bank, but I thought it worked best with the expensive (yet very convenient) base. Considering it also doesn’t have any built-in cables, we decided to bump the Prime battery from its position and replace it with the Anker Retractable Cable Laptop Bank. There’s still plenty to like about the Prime battery: it’s solid, attractive and tells you just how much charge it has left with its onboard display. When you add the optional base, you not only get a convenient drop-and-go way to recharge, it also acts as a charging hub with three additional USB ports.\nEcoFlow Rapid magnetic power bank\nI was curious to try out the first power bank from EcoFlow, a company that primarily makes larger power stations and whole-home backup batteries. The first offering in the brand’s Rapid series is a Qi2-enabled magnetic charger with a 5,000mAh capacity. It looks quite nice with shiny silver accents and soft-touch grey plastic on the MagSafe-compatible front. There’s a little pull-out leg that sturdily displays your phone as it charges and the attached USB-C cable lets you refill devices directly, then tucks out of the way when it’s not in use. But it didn’t outperform our top pick in the MagSafe category, in terms of both charging speeds and the amount of charge delivered.\nBaseus Blade 2\nThe Blade 2 from Baseus has a unique, flat shape that’s just a little wider than an ereader — which may make it easier to slip into a low profile laptop bag. It charged a Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra considerably faster than any other battery bank we tried, getting it from four percent to full in just over an hour. It then filled the phone back to 62 percent from dead on a second charge in about a half an hour. But $100 is a lot for a standard power bank that holds fewer than two full charges. But if you can find the Blade 2 on sale, snap it up.\nAnker MagGo (6.6K)\nAnker’s 6.6k MagGo is pretty similar to our top pick for a MagSafe-compatible battery pack. It supports the Qi2 charging standard and props up your iPhone so you can use it or enable StandBy mode while powering up. This one even lets you set the viewing angle from 30 to 65 degrees. It was speedy in getting an iPhone 15 up to 50 percent in about 40 minutes. But for the added bulk, it doesn’t have as much capacity as the 10K MagGo, holding just enough juice for a single full charge plus about 5 percent. But it is $20 cheaper, which may be key for some.\nMophie Snap+ Powerstation Mini\nThe Mophie snap+ Powerstation Mini is terribly well-built. It feels premium with a rubberized contact point for the MagSafe charging pad and a stand that runs the entire width of the bank itself, making it extra sturdy. It’s compact, too, but only carries a 5,000mAh capacity, which gets you a partial charge on most newer or larger phones. Our current MagSafe/iPhone pick has double the capacity, a stand and a digital display — for just $20 more than the Powerstation Mini.\nPower bank FAQs\nWhat's the difference between a portable power bank and a portable charger?\nA slew of terms are used to describe power banks, including portable batteries, portable chargers, external battery packs and even, somewhat confusingly, USB chargers, which is what wall chargers are often called. They all mean the same thing: a lithium ion battery that stores a charge so you can refill a smartphone, tablet, earbuds, console controller, ereader, laptop, or just about any other device with its own built-in, rechargeable battery. \nThere’s little difference between the terms, so the specs you’ll want to pay attention to are capacity (expressed in mAh), size and weight so you can find the right balance between recharging what you need and portability.\nPower stations, on the other hand, are distinct. These are bigger units (often around the size of a car battery) that can be used to charge multiple devices multiple times, but notably, they can’t be taken on airplanes.\nDoes fast charging actually ruin your battery?\nNot exactly. The real enemy of a battery’s longevity is heat. The faster you charge a battery, the more heat is generated. Modern phones have features that keep the battery cool while charging, like physical heat shields and heat sinks, as well as software features that slow down processes that generate too much heat. Phone manufacturers are keen to promote a phone’s fast-charging abilities, so they had to figure out ways to make faster charging work.\nWhile there aren’t long-term studies on what fast charging does to a phone, a study on EV batteries (which use the same general concept of charged lithium ions flowing from one side of the battery to the other, absorbing or releasing a usable charge) showed a very slight decrease in capacity over time with only fast charging — though what actually made a larger difference was how hot the battery itself was, due to ambient temperatures, when it was charged.\nIn short, fast charging could be slightly harder on your battery than normal charging. But the safeguards most smartphones have make that difference fairly negligible. To really ensure you’re taking the best care of your battery, limiting heat exposure overall is one of the best things you can do.\nCan you use a power bank for all your devices?\nThat depends on the size of the bank and the size of your device’s battery. A small 5,000mAh battery isn’t strong enough to charge laptops, but a portable charger with a 20,000mAh capacity will give your computer a partial refill. You also have to consider port compatibility. If your device has a USB port, you’ll be able to easily find a cable to connect it to a battery. If your device has a more unique port, such as a DC port, you won’t be able to use a battery. Devices with an AC cable and plug can be charged, and sometimes powered (such as in the case of a printer or speaker), by larger laptop batteries with AC ports.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-power-bank-143048526.html?src=rss",
    "full_text": "For reference, it took our former top pick in this category an hour and a half to do the same. There’s no digital screen to tell you how much charge remains in the battery, just four indicator LEDs. While color options probably won’t make or break your battery pack purchase, I appreciate that the BoostCharge 20K comes in something other than standard black. Mophie’s Powerstation Pro AC is so massive it necessitates a grab handle and get close to the edge of that max carry-on size. So it might be better to just remember how much you’ve used the brick rather than relying too heavily on its indicators. The Anker laptop power bank with built-in cable forgoes any clever naming scheme, but makes sure you’re never left without a way to charge your stuff. Current restrictions implemented by the TSA still allow external batteries rated at 100Wh or less (which all of our recommendations are) to fly with you, but only in your carry-on luggage — they can’t be checked. In addition to simple energy loss through heat dissipation, factors like voltage conversion also bring down the amount of juice that makes it into your phone. What that means in practical terms is an iPhone will charge just fine plugged into a power bank’s 18W port. For around $20, higher-capacity charging cables will make sure you’re not wasting time with connections that limit your potential power transfer."

    "summary": "Welcome to Video Games Weekly on Engadget. Expect a new story every Monday or Tuesday, broken into two parts. The first is a space for short essays and ramblings about video game trends and related topics from me, Jess Conditt, a reporter who's covered the industry for more than 13 years. The second contains the video game stories from the past week that you need to know about, including some headlines from outside of Engadget.\nPlease enjoy — and I'll see you next week.\n\nLet’s all agree to stop talking about that awful conservative activist group out of Australia. You know the one — like a parasite, it attached itself to the censorship campaign that erased thousands of adult games from Steam and Itch.io, and successfully positioned itself at the center of the delisting narrative. However, logic and evidence suggests this group had very little to do with the mass removals.\nThis Australian anti-porn organization led a movement in April to remove the edgelord simulator No Mercy from Steam, and since everyone agreed that game sucked, the campaign worked and the title disappeared from the storefront. This is where I believe the organization’s involvement in the current drama ends.\nIt seems No Mercy spurred payment processors including Visa, Mastercard and PayPal to turn their attention to the PC gaming market (an irony that I would find funnier if it weren’t actively eroding an industry I love). These institutions took the opportunity to dictate the types of games they would support, and in response on July 16, Steam added a clause to its ruleset banning content that \"may violate the rules and standards set forth by Steam’s payment processors,\" including “certain kinds of adult only content.” Censorship on Steam is not new; Valve has for years had rules banning mislabeled adult content, hate speech, anything violating local laws and many other regulations. But outsourcing censorship to payment processors is new, and hundreds of games were removed from the platform following the rule change. On July 24, Itch.io rolled out its own changes and summarily de-indexed every adult and NSFW game it hosted, which amounted to roughly 20,000 titles being hidden from search and browse pages.\nThe conservative Australian group claimed responsibility for the Steam bans on July 19, three days after the platform’s rule change went live. The organization said the censorship was the direct result of two of its recent efforts: an email campaign that sent 1,067 messages to Visa, Mastercard, PayPal and others claiming Steam and Itch.io were hosting illegal sexual content, and an open letter addressed to the same financial institutions, signed by faith-based, anti-sex work and anti-queer activist groups.\nThere is no evidence that these campaigns were directly responsible for payment processors’ renewed enforcements. It’s actually ludicrous to suggest that roughly 1,000 emails or an open letter would even register at companies the size of Visa, Mastercard or PayPal. What’s more, after taking credit for the removal of hundreds of Steam games, the Australian group has attempted to distance itself from the whole shebang. Following intense scrutiny from players, industry watchdogs and media outlets, every group in this situation is trying to avoid accountability, in fact. Valve says Mastercard made this happen, while Mastercard says it’s just following the law, and PayPal says it’s simply doing what companies like Mastercard tell it to do. Meanwhile, the Australian group is trying to avoid blame for the sweeping Itch.io delistings while simultaneously attempting to exploit the Steam bans and gain momentum for its conservative bullshit.\nIn the most likely scenario, the Australian activist group saw these PC gaming audits coming and, in a strange act of stolen puritanical valor, took steps to center itself in the conversation. We can stop helping it do so. Forget its name and, as the IGDA suggests, direct your ire toward the organizations with power in this situation, namely Mastercard and Visa.\nStill. It’s notable that an organization backed by conservative Christian groups that loudly oppose sex work, queer rights and freedom of expression was able to so cleanly align itself with financial companies censoring content on Steam and Itch.io. This uncontested endorsement is especially worrisome in a political and social climate where women, the queer community, people of color and those who don’t conform to a traditional conservative lifestyle are under attack. At a time like this, subversive and raw art is more necessary than ever, but it’s also in its most vulnerable position. Choosing this moment to activate a censorship campaign is not only dangerous for our most vulnerable communities, it’s cowardly.\nThere’s been some additional misinformation wrapped up in this censorship mess, of course. Three games were incorrectly reported as delisted or removed from Itch.io or Steam as part of this situation: Mouthwashing, Trials of Innocence and Console Me. One game that was unjustly removed during the chaos was the psychological horror game VILE: Exhumed — read my interview with creator Cara Cadaver right here.\n\nThe news\nBioShock 4 enters a new circle of development hell\nIn most contexts, I’d be pretty stoked on the thought of a hell-based BioShock, but this is the worst possible iteration of that idea. According to Bloomberg, BioShock 4 failed a recent review with executives at its publisher, 2K Games, and it’s heading back to developers at Cloud Chamber for a narrative revamp. Plus, Cloud Chamber studio head Kelley Gilmore is gone and creative director Hogarth de la Plante was moved to a publishing role. Not much is known about the game that’s assumed to be BioShock 4, but it was revealed in 2019 alongside the formation of Cloud Chamber, so it’s already been in development for quite a while.\nIn related Rapture news, 2K’s remake of the original BioShock was canceled earlier this year, Bloomberg reports. Ken Levine, the creator of the BioShock series, is currently working on a familiar-looking FPS called Judas at his own studio, Ghost Story Games.\nGOG gave away millions of games to protest censorship\nGOG partnered with developers to release 13 games with adult themes for free from August 1 to 3, in protest of all the censorship going down on Steam and Itch.io. None of the free titles were specifically banned in the censorship campaign, but they featured sexual, queer or violent content that could easily be targeted by similar efforts. GOG handed out its free games to more than 1 million players.\nItch.io is reindexing free NSFW games\nAfter deindexing all of its adult games on July 24 — like, all of them — Itch.io on August 1 relisted all free games in this category. Itch.io is currently auditing thousands of adult and NSFW games that it swept up in the payment processor ban, and it’s unclear how the platform will support titles with these themes going forward. One of Itch.io’s longstanding partners, Stripe, said it will no longer facilitate transactions of titles \"designed for sexual gratification,\" but there’s apparently room for negotiation in the future.\nBattlefield 6 will land on October 10\nIn a shocking twist, EA also revealed that Battlefield 6 will have multiplayer content.\nAge verification is coming to an Xbox near you\nThe video game world is feeling the effects of the UK's Online Safety Act. Platforms including Discord and Xbox are implementing new age-verification methods to comply with the law in the UK, and Microsoft is planning to expand its program to other regions. It's in no rush, though, saying it'll use the UK as a guinea pig for these systems first, and then implement what it learns across the globe.\nSony is suing Tencent over its blatant Horizon clone\nAt its unveiling in 2024, viewers instantly called out Polaris Quest’s Light of Motiram for looking an awful lot like Guerrilla Games' Horizon series — our headline called it a \"pretty blatant Horizon ripoff,\" even. It took the better part of a year, but PlayStation's lawyers have finally kicked into gear. Sony is now suing Tencent, which owns Polaris Quest, over what it calls a \"slavish clone\" of its IP.\nRaven finally has a union contract with Microsoft\nRecent layoffs at Microsoft have only heightened the importance of proper labor organizing in video games, and one of the industry’s first unions is finally making things official. Three years after initiating the process, Call of Duty support studio Raven Software has ratified its union contract with Microsoft. Raven Software initially voted to organize under Activision Blizzard, but after Microsoft completed its acquisition of the studio in October 2023, it continued negotiations with the tech titan.\nPlay VILE: Exhumed, the game that Steam doesn't want you to see\nAfter VILE: Exhumed was removed and permanently banned from Steam for reasons that don't actually apply to the game, developer Cara Cadaver and publisher DreadXP have rolled out their own distribution model, and prices start at $0. You can download and play the game right now for free, and there's an option to throw some money Cara's way. A portion of the profits will benefit the Toronto-based charity Red Door Family Shelter.\n\nAdditional reading\n\nKris Holt’s indie game roundup\nSam Rutherford’s review of the Legion Go S powered by SteamOS\n\n\nHave a tip for Jessica?

    "summary": "Intel is reportedly still struggling with a chipmaking process crucial to its future. Reuters reports that the company's 18A process is still producing low yields and high defect rates. Intel has invested billions of dollars in the manufacturing process, on which it's pinned its hopes of gaining ground on TSMC.\nThis isn't the first concerning news about 18A. Last year, a report stated that Broadcom was unhappy with the results of a test run for a potential order. However, Intel insisted at the time that 18A was on track to make its upcoming Panther Lake chips at volume later this year. \"Our performance and yield trajectory gives us confidence this will be a successful launch that further strengthens Intel's position in the notebook market,\" Intel said last month.\nIntel has typically aimed for a yield of at least 50 percent of usable chips before scaling up production. The company is said to make the bulk of its profit after reaching 70 to 80 percent. Last year, 18A's usable Panther Lake chips had reportedly only reached a five percent threshold. Intel had aimed for 10 percent by this summer. Tuesday's report doesn't state 18A's current yield, only describing it as a small percentage.\nIn a statement sent to Engadget, an Intel spokesperson said it is pleased with 18A's current state. \"We feel very good about our trajectory on Intel 18A, and it will be the foundation of multiple generations of client and server products in the coming years,\" the spokesperson wrote. \"Panther Lake is going to be a great product for Intel and our partners,\" the company continued, adding that its launch is still on track for later this year.\nIn a July interview with Reuters, Intel's Chief Financial Officer David Zinsner suggested that 18A's yields were better than reports claimed. He added that yields tend to \"start off low and improve over time.\"\nThe company's 18A process is a risky bet, combining manufacturing changes with a next-gen transistor design. Intel embraced the challenge with an aggressive timeline that one of Reuters' sources called a hail mary. 18A going well would also help attract business for its upcoming 14A process. Last month, Intel warned investors that it may have to leave chip manufacturing altogether if it doesn't land 14A contracts.\nThe company needs all the help it can get. It recently confirmed that it would cut around 20 percent of its workforce by the end of this year. That follows 20,000 job cuts from June 2024 to July 2025. Earlier this year, it took on a new CEO to try to right the ship.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/intels-next-gen-manufacturing-process-is-reportedly-still-struggling-184146350.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Step aside, old boy. The ThinkPad X9-14 Aura Edition is making me forget all about the ThinkPad X1 Carbon, the most renowned business laptop for over a decade. Of course, Lenovo isn’t doing away with the X1 Carbon, but the X9 series certainly seems like the company’s experimental project for the same premium category. It’s not perfect, but I like where Lenovo is going with it.\nMuch love has been packed into the X9-14’s impressively ultraportable design, including a stunning 14-inch OLED screen, strong speakers, long battery life and solid performance for casual business users. The problem is that it costs a chunky $1,283 for low-end specs, it doesn’t come with a USB Type-A port and it’s failing the legacy of excellent ThinkPad keyboards. \nThat doesn’t stop the ThinkPad X9-14 Aura Edition from doing the best with what it’s got, and it’s got a lot.\n \nLookin’ sleek and ready for travel\nI’ve always been a fan of bold, colorful laptops, but I understand that in a business setting you’d want to blend in. The ThinkPad X9-14, however, manages to do so in style — it won’t draw your coworkers in from across the room, but you’ll hear a good ol’ “ooo” when they get a closer look. The dark gray aluminum frame looks like it was carved out of a space rock and then blasted with sand (or oxide, both give that sparkly grainy look). Of course, there’s the iconic ThinkPad logo in the top left corner of the lid with a red LED, but there’s also a X9-14 logo at the very top, which sits on an oblong island giving machine-look vibes.\nThe interior sports more of the same minimalist design, with my favorite visual aesthetic being the keys. It looks like someone carved away the bottom of each one to add a bit of flair, and I’m all about it. And if you’re not a fan of bezels, they take up very little room on the display. There’s a 4K webcam on the lip, which you can disable with the F9 button when you’re out of meetings. I’d do it in meetings too, because of its poor video quality — my features were fuzzy and my face was red.\nThe ThinkPad X9-14’s chassis maintains a remarkably thin 0.26-inch profile up until you get to the ports, where it expands to a neat 0.68-inch block that also holds the fans. There’s only four ports, but most of the essentials are covered, including two Thunderbolt 4 ports, an HDMI slot and a headphone jack. The critical miss is the lack of a USB Type-A port, which the 15-inch model supports.\nDespite that drawback, the X9-14’s thin frame combined with its 2.8-pound chassis make for an exceptionally ultraportable business laptop that won’t be a pain to pull out at a TSA checkpoint.\nPretty on the eyes, music to my ears\nNothing will make me gush more than a pretty OLED screen, and the ThinkPad X9-14 had me blushing like a pink Starburst. In my experience, OLED panels are less straining on the eyes (although this topic is somewhat of a debate), but I prefer them when I’m working all day. Even when you’re all done with your business, you won’t be able to pull away from this 14-inch screen with its 2,880 x 1,800 resolution. That’s sharp enough to capture each strand of hair on your favorite furry Disney sidekick. And whether you’re scrolling through endless rows of data on your spreadsheets or making your way through your indie-game library, the X9’s 120Hz refresh rate will enable smoother visuals than the average business laptop. The one thing I hate, though, is the rounded edges because it cuts off some of the visuals.\nI watched an episode of Steven Universe, which is iconic for its pastel color palette, and my eyes practically swam in the crystal blue ocean of Beach City. The dialogue sounded a bit quiet, but tinkering with the Dolby Atmos settings gave it the boost it needed.\nI couldn’t stop myself from jumping into a match of Marvel Rivals to keep my weekly challenge streak running, and the ThinkPad’s OLED allowed me to soak in all of the game’s vivid colors. I tried out Phoenix for the first time and blasted enemies with her cosmic flames, creating a visual spectacle of orange and yellow. The cacophony of explosions were distinct and well-balanced on the audio side as well, I could hear that jabroni (Star Lord) screaming “Legendary!” on my backline. The dual-speaker setup produced well-rounded audio for a business laptop. Tracks like “Golden” from KPop Demon Hunters (my new obsession) popped with crisp vocals and bassy synths, so feel free to take off your sweaty headphones and vibe at the end of the workday.\n\n\n\n\n\n   Rami Tabari for Engadget \n \n\nMushy click-clack and haptic feedback\nLike Rumi’s relationship with Jinu (I told you I’m obsessed), my relationship with this keyboard is complicated. I’m clicking away at this review, and the ThinkPad X9-14 is comfortable to type on, but it’s not as clicky as I want it to be. There’s some decent travel, but the keys are just… mushy. Sure, I can type on it all day as the buttons are very well-spaced, but they’re not satisfying to use. I imagine for most folks that might be fine, but after testing hundreds of laptops, I can say for certain there are better keyboards out there.\nOn the other hand, the touchpad was so smooth that my fingers slid across its glassy surface like a figure skater at the Olympics. Its haptic feedback offers enough response to mimic the real thing, and I’ve actually grown to like haptics more than real touchpads, which are terribly inconsistent.\nIn addition to the trackpad and keyboard, you can also use the ThinkPad X9's touchscreen to get work done. I experienced some resistance when rearranging some of my browser windows, so it’s not great if you’re just using your fingers. But I’m sure folks that need to sketch will appreciate it, especially since the OLED display will do justice to your art. (For some reason, Lenovo’s website doesn’t say that its pens are compatible with the ThinkPad X9-14, but a Lenovo representative confirmed they are, and the laptop itself also features the Lenovo Pen Settings app.)\nThe ThinkPad X9's performance: Business casual\nI’ve enjoyed my time with the ThinkPad X9-14 so far, and that’s with its bottom-of-the-barrel CPU, the Intel Core Ultra 5 226V, plus 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD. I expected some lackluster performance, maybe even a little slowdown, but it actually felt pretty smooth.\nI used the ThinkPad X9-14 to do a little work on the fantasy novella I’m writing, which, if you know anything about the genre, requires me to have an obscene number of tabs open. I split my screen in three, between Campfire, Google Docs and Legend Keeper, my unholy trinity of world building. The ThinkPad kept up with my shenanigans, so it’ll do well with most casual office workflows.\nIf you’re really crunching numbers, though, the Intel Core Ultra 5 226V is the lowest performing CPU you can get in the X9-14, which isn’t necessarily a bad thing, until you see the price (I’ll go into that below). Its benchmark scores aren’t far off from the Zenbook A14, but ASUS’ chosen Snapdragon X X1 CPU got marked for its slow performance. That’s likely because the Zenbook needs to emulate Windows apps due to its ARM architecture. While the Zenbook A14’s scores are a smidge better than the ThinkPad X9-14, at least with the latter you don’t have to worry about the latency of emulating apps or running into compatibility issues.\nSince the MacBook Air has been getting cheaper, I’d be remiss not to consider it as a competitor to the ThinkPad X9, either. If you’re shopping for any flavor of ThinkPad as a business laptop, you’re likely looking for security features, or remote management tools (if you’re in IT), and MacBooks offer both. The MacBook Air M4 13-inch is roughly 50 percent more powerful than the ThinkPad and the Zenbook. Again, the ThinkPad X9-14 still offers decent performance, just don’t expect to do anything taxing like video-editing.\nNow, if you’re thinking about cutting out some work and doing more play, the X9-14’s Intel Arc Graphics iGPU is surprisingly capable. You’re not going to be playing AAA games on max settings, but I hopped into a few matches of Marvel Rivals and managed a decent 40 to 55 frames per second. I maintained the native resolution but cranked everything down to Low with Ultra Performance and Frame Generation enabled.\nThe ThinkPad X9-14 crushed the Zenbook A14 in terms of graphics, and while the MacBook Air delivered stronger performance overall for video-editing and designing, it can’t compare to the gaming compatibility that the X9-14 offers.\nAnd like most modern laptops, the ThinkPad X9-14 has an NPU. If your job requires you to work with natively-run AI features, the ThinkPad X9-14 will aggregate those spreadsheets for you (and create cursed memes of, say, your boss’ face on a dog’s body).\n\n\n\n\n   Rami Tabari for Engadget \n \n\nA battery for business hours and beyond\nI spent quite a bit of time with the ThinkPad X9-14 before it eventually ran out of steam. It survived me working on this review, jumping to my book at the end of the day and a late night Discord chat with friends. On our video rundown battery test, it lasted 11 hours and 51 minutes. That’s more than enough to carry on your business and even add some overtime (or, you know, kick back and relax to some chill videos).\nThe competition is stiff, though. Last year’s ASUS Zenbook S14, which has an Intel chipset, clocked over 4 hours longer than the ThinkPad X9-14. Meanwhile, Snapdragon X laptops blow all those Intel machines out of the water, with systems like the ASUS Zenbook A14 coming in at 18:16. Still, while Lenovo's notebook might fall short of those impressive runtimes, at least it doesn't have the same app limitations that hold those devices back. It’ll get the job done, and that’s what matters.\nIs it worth the business tax?\nSo how much does this all cost? Well, the model I reviewed comes with an Intel Core Ultra 5 226V, 16GB of RAM (though only the 32GB configuration is currently available) and a 512GB SSD. That totals out to $1,283 on Lenovo's website (with 32GB of RAM). For context, I’ve seen more powerful gaming laptops that cost less. But you’re not buying a business laptop for its power, you (or your IT manager) are buying it for its features.\nWhile many non-business laptops are designed to be durable, you are still getting a military-grade chassis, which has been tested against drops, shocks and extreme temperatures. Then there’s Lenovo’s ThinkShield Security suite. That’s just a fancy term for saying the ThinkPad X9-14 includes a standard dTPM security chip, a fingerprint reader, a IR webcam for Windows Hello, an e-shutter for the webcam (F9) and Intel’s Threat Detection Technology (TDT) that uses AI to uncover cyberattacks. Intel TDT is included with Intel vPro, which can be used for remote management.\nNow, if you want that laundry list of business features and top-tier performance, it’s going to hurt. To upgrade to an Intel Core Ultra 7 268V with a 1TB SSD, it’ll cost $1,939. Yep, that’s quite the leap for specs we’ve seen in significantly cheaper laptops (like the Dell 16 and 14 Plus).\nIt’s important to note, however, that business laptops like the ThinkPad X9-14 aren’t really intended for individual consumers but rather businesses looking to buy in bulk. There are business laptops priced at a level that might appeal more to the average consumer, like the $1,399 ASUS ExpertBook P5 (P5405), but those are more rare than I’d like. For that price, the ExpertBook comes with a Core Ultra 7, 32GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD.\nWrap-up\nI thought I’d be more disappointed with the ThinkPad X9-14 considering its low-end CPU, but it’s perfectly suited for everyday tasks and made for a great writing companion. What really sold me was the OLED screen and audio, which are great not just for watching training videos or slideshows but also (and equally important) for after work when you get some play in, whether that’s literally playing games or binging your favorite new series.\nI also appreciate the battery life and portability, plus all of Lenovo’s security features packed into a military-grade chassis.\nHowever, I can’t justify the average consumer paying $1,283 for the ThinkPad X9-14 with specs you’d find in laptops that cost hundreds of dollars less (minus the RAM, of course). For small business owners, I recommend waiting for a sale or consider a business laptop marketed more toward you (again, the ASUS ExpertBook P5 (P5405) is a great choice). But if you’re the IT person at a company looking for a laptop to buy in bulk, then yes, the ThinkPad X9-14 is a worthy purchase.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/lenovo-thinkpad-x9-14-aura-edition-review-a-solid-business-laptop-with-some-quirks-171551190.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "For the first time since GPT-2 in 2019, OpenAI is releasing new open-weight large language models. It's a major milestone for a company that has increasingly been accused of forgoing its original stated mission of \"ensuring artificial general intelligence benefits all of  humanity.\" Now, following multiple delays for additional safety testing and refinement, gpt-oss-120b and gpt-oss-20b are available to download from Hugging Face.\nBefore going any further, it's worth taking a moment to clarify what exactly OpenAI is doing here. The company is not releasing new open-source models that include the underlying code and data the company used to train them. Instead, it's sharing the weights — that is, the numerical values the models learned to assign to inputs during their training — that inform the new systems. According to Benjamin C. Lee, professor of engineering and computer science at the University of Pennsylvania, open-weight and open-source models serve two very different purposes.\n\"An open-weight model provides the values that were learned during the training of a large language model, and those essentially allow you to use the model and build on top of it. You could use the model out of the box, or you could redefine or fine-tune it for a particular application, adjusting the weights as you like,\" he said. If commercial models are an absolute black box and an open-source system allows for complete customization and modification, open-weight AIs are somewhere in the middle.\nOpenAI has not released open-source models, likely since a rival could use the training data and code to reverse engineer its tech. \"An open-source model is more than just the weights. It would also potentially include the code used to run the training process,\" Lee said. And practically speaking, the average person wouldn't get much use out of an open-source model unless they had a farm of high-end NVIDIA GPUs running up their electricity bill. (They would be useful for researchers looking to learn more about the data the company used to train its models though, and there are a handful of open-source models out there like Mistral NeMo and Mistral Small 3.)\nWith that out of the way, the primary difference between gpt-oss-120b and gpt-oss-20b is how many parameters each one offers. If you're not familiar with the term, parameters are the settings a large language model can tweak to provide you with an answer. The naming is slightly confusing here, but gpt-oss-120b is a 117 billion parameter model, while its smaller sibling is a 21-billion one.\nIn practice, that means gpt-oss-120b requires more powerful hardware to run, with OpenAI recommending a single 80GB GPU for efficient use. The good news is the company says any modern computer with 16GB of RAM can run gpt-oss-20b. As a result, you could use the smaller model to do something like vibe code on your own computer without a connection to the internet. What's more, OpenAI is making the models available through the Apache 2.0 license, giving people a great deal of flexibility to modify the systems to their needs.\nDespite this not being a new commercial release, OpenAI says the new models are in many ways comparable to its proprietary systems. The one limitation of the oss models is that they don't offer multi-modal input, meaning they can't process images, video and voice. For those capabilities, you'll still need to turn to the cloud and OpenAI's commercial models, something both new open-weight systems can be configured to do. Beyond that, however, they offer many of the same capabilities, including chain-of-thought reasoning and tool use. That means the models can tackle more complex problems by breaking them into smaller steps, and if they need additional assistance, they know how to use the web and coding languages like Python.\nAdditionally, OpenAI trained the models using techniques the company previously employed in the development of o3 and its other recent frontier systems. In competition-level coding gpt-oss-120b earned a score that is only a shade worse than o3, OpenAI's current state-of-the-art reasoning model, while gpt-oss-20b landed in between o3-mini and o4-mini. Of course, we'll have to wait for more real-world testing to see how the two new models compare to OpenAI's commercial offerings and those of its rivals.\nThe release of gpt-oss-120b and gpt-oss-20b and OpenAI's apparent willingness to double down on open-weight models comes after Mark Zuckerberg signaled Meta would release fewer such systems to the public. Open-sourcing was previously central to Zuckerberg's messaging about his company's AI efforts, with the CEO once remarking about closed-source systems \"fuck that.\" At least among the sect of tech enthusiasts willing to tinker with LLMs, the timing, accidental or not, is somewhat embarrassing for Meta.\n\"One could argue that open-weight models democratize access to the largest, most capable models to people who don't have these massive, hyperscale data centers with lots of GPUs,\" said Professor Lee. \"It allows people to use the outputs or products of a months-long training process on a massive data center without having to invest in that infrastructure on their own. From the perspective of someone who just wants a really capable model to begin with, and then wants to build for some application. I think open-weight models can be really useful.\"\nOpenAI is already working with a few different organizations to deploy their own versions of these models, including AI Sweden, the country's national center for applied AI. In a press briefing OpenAI held before today's announcement, the team that worked on gpt-oss-120b and gpt-oss-20b said they view the two models as an experiment; the more people use them, the more likely OpenAI is to release additional open-weight models in the future.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/openais-first-new-open-weight-llms-in-six-years-are-here-170019087.html?src=rss",

Learn more and sign up for #MadeByGoogle updates: https://t.co/JOdjGMGYxY pic.twitter.com/nvXep5w5Ru — Made by Google (@madebygoogle) August 4, 2025 There have been plenty of leaks , so we likely know what's coming and some specs. The splashy Pixel 10 Pro Fold reportedly features a new display and hinge, which could account for the supply chain delay. The Pixel Watch 4 reportedly includes new internal hardware and a modified charging system which both could be contributing to the delay. We'll just have to wait for August 20. This isn't a streaming event, so follow along with our liveblog of the entire proceedings."

    "summary": "At start of December, Google DeepMind released Genie 2. The Genie family of AI systems are what are known as world models. They're capable of generating images as the user — either a human or, more likely, an automated AI agent — moves through the world the software is simulating. The resulting video of the model in action may look like a video game, but DeepMind has always positioned Genie 2 as a way to train other AI systems to be better at what they're designed to accomplish. With its new Genie 3 model, which the lab announced on Tuesday, DeepMind believes it has made an even better system for training AI agents.   \nAt first glance, the jump between Genie 2 and 3 isn't as dramatic as the one the model made last year. With Genie 2, DeepMind's system became capable of generating 3D worlds, and could accurately reconstruct part of the environment even after the user or an AI agent left it to explore other parts of the generated scene. Environmental consistency was often a weakness of prior world models. For instance, Decart's Oasis system had trouble remembering the layout of the Minecraft levels it would generate. \nBy comparison, the enhancements offered by Genie 3 seem more modest, but in a press briefing Google held ahead of today's official announcement, Shlomi Fruchter, research director at DeepMind, and Jack Parker-Holder, research scientist at DeepMind, argued they represent important stepping stones in the road toward artificial general intelligence.\nSo what exactly does Genie 3 do better? To start, it outputs footage at 720p, instead of 360p like its predecessor. It's also capable of sustaining a \"consistent\" simulation for longer. Genie 2 had a theoretical limit of up to 60 seconds, but in practice the model would often start to hallucinate much earlier. By contrast, DeepMind says Genie 3 is capable of running for several minutes before it starts producing artifacts.\n\nAlso new to the model is a capability DeepMind calls \"promptable world events.\" Genie 2 was interactive insofar as the user or an AI agent was able to input movement commands and the model would respond after it had a few moments to generate the next frame. Genie 3 does this work in real-time. Moreover, it’s possible to tweak the simulation with text prompts that instruct Genie to alter the state of the world it’s generating. In a demo DeepMind showed, the model was told to insert a herd of deer into a scene of a person skiing down a mountain. The deer didn't move in the most realistic manner, but this is the killer feature of Genie 3, says DeepMind.\nAs mentioned before, the lab primarily envisions the model as a tool for training and evaluating AI agents. DeepMind says Genie 3 could be used to teach AI systems to tackle \"what if\" scenarios that aren't covered by their pre-training. \"There are a lot of things that have to happen before a model can be deployed in the real world, but we do see it as a way to more efficiently train models and increase their reliability,\" said Fruchter, pointing to, for example, a scenario where Genie 3 could be used to teach a self-driving car how to safely avoid a pedestrian that walks in front of it.\nGoogle DeepMind\nDespite the improvements DeepMind has made to Genie, the lab acknowledges there's much work to be done. For instance, the model can't generate real-world locations with perfect accuracy, and it struggles with text rendering. Moreover, for Genie to be truly useful, DeepMind believes the model needs to be able to sustain a simulated world for hours, not minutes. Still, the lab feels Genie is ready to make a real-world impact.\n\"We already at the point where you wouldn't use [Genie] as your sole training environment, but you can certainly finds things you wouldn't want agents to do because if they act unsafe in some settings, even if those settings aren't perfect, it's still good to know,\" said Parker-Holder. \"You can already see where this is going. It will get increasingly useful as the models get better.\"\nFor the time being, Genie 3 isn't available to the general public. However, DeepMind says it's working to make the model available to additional testers.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/google-deepminds-genie-3-can-dynamically-alter-the-state-of-its-simulated-worlds-140052124.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "After trialing the service in Ireland and Canada last month, Spotify has officially launched its Audiobooks+ service in the US, Europe, Australia and elsewhere. An add-on available to Spotify Premium members, as well as individual users on Family and Duo plans, it adds an extra 15 hours of listening on top of the 15 hours available for Premium subscribers. \nIf you're an individual Spotify Premium subscriber, it's fairly straightforward upgrade. Paying an extra $12 per month for Audiobooks+ (on top of the $12 per month you're paying for Premium) nets you 15 extra hours of audiobook listening, on top of the 15 free hours already included in the plan. \nHere's how it works if you're in a $20 Premium Family or $17 Duo plan. First of all, while those plans do include 15 hours of free audiobook listening, they can only be accessed by the plan manager. With Audiobooks+, though, other plan members can now pay for access. All they need to do is ask the plan manager to add the Audiobooks+ option, again for $12 per month, and they'll gain 15 hours of listening. The plan manager can also purchase a $13.00 one-time 10-hour top-up (for themselves or other plan members) in order to finish a book.\nSpotify has gradually expanded its Audiobooks content offerings over the last year or two, having recently added book publisher Bloomsbury. The company also offers an audiobook-only subscription plan priced at $10 per month for 15 hours of listening. Depending on the audiobook, however, it may be cheaper just to buy it outright than topping up your Spotify account if you want to listen to multiple titles in a month. Along with the US, Ireland and Canada, Audiobooks+ is now available in the UK, Australia, New Zealand, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, and LiechtensteinThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/spotifys-premium-audiobook-feature-launches-in-the-us-140010986.html?src=rss",
