It’s hard to understate how important this book was. The Cuckoo’s Egg showed young cybersecurity enthusiasts how to investigate a cyber incident, and it showed the wider public that stories about computer spies could be as exciting as those of real-life James Bond-like figures. This book is deeply researched, well represented, and both part-history and part-celebration of the hacker community that morphed from the curious-minded misfits whistling into a telephone to score free long-distance calls, to becoming a powerful community wielding geopolitical power and featured prominently in mainstream culture."

That being said, it’s still possible to save on a preorder purchase, or at the very least receive some credit you can then spend on accessories like the Galaxy Watch 8. Ahead of its release on July 25th, Samsung is offering up to $1,000 in credit for the last-gen Z Fold 6 and S25 Ultra — or less, if you’re trading in an older phone. AT&T will provide $1,100 in credits over 36 months to customers on postpaid unlimited plans who purchase the new phone with an installment plan. Verizon is also offering up to $1,100 in monthly credits over 36 months with an eligible trade-in in “any condition,” although the carrier doesn’t list or even mention any eligible phones. You must also be on an Unlimited Ultimate plan to get that much credit. T-Mobile is offering up to $1,100 in monthly credits for those auto-paying for a plan that costs $85 or more per month — no trade-in required. If you’re preordering directly through Samsung, you will receive a $50 Samsung credit to use on accessories as an extra perk. Not all carriers are offering a free storage upgrade right now"

There was no navigation,” USPS historian Stephen Kochersperger says. “That was where commercial aviation took off,” Kochersperger says. It turns out missiles just can’t carry that much mail. The Regulus I missle carried 3,000 pieces of mail (1959). The Transorma multi-position letter sorting machine measured 13 feet high and was split across two levels. The clerks would then use a keyboard to enter information about their destination. In 1965, the USPS began to send large volumes of mail through OCR machines, allowing a “digital eye” to recognize addresses and automatically sort letters. If the machine couldn’t make out a person’s handwriting, the USPS would send an image to a remote encoding center (REC) for human review. “The Postal Service is a driver of technological change,” McKean says."

It can then biodegrade completely in about 45 days, according to the company. “He would have gotten a kick out of it, out of the fact that he was the first [to be buried in a Living Cocoon],” Marsya adds. Marsya described an iconic photo of her dad sitting on a green Volkswagen bus on the way to Woodstock, looking out over a traffic jam with binoculars, soon after Marsya was born and came home from the hospital. Marsya also finds the chemicals used in embalming “gross.” A desire to minimize waste and pollution is another reason some people are turning away from standard caskets or cremation. A “green” burial doesn’t have to incorporate mushrooms, of course. The goal is primarily to encourage decomposition and use natural materials in a sustainable way, Bar says.

Here's a quick guide to help cut through the confusion. OLED tends to have the best picture quality because it doesn't need a backlight and every pixel can be either on or off, leading to great black levels. More so than any \"feature,\" stepping up in TV screen size is the best use of your money. One of the most common post-TV-purchase complaints I've heard is from people who didn't go big enough. And I rarely hear people complain that their TV is too large. It's worth adding that while TVs can get really big indeed, 4K resolution is sufficient for even the biggest models, and CNET doesn't recommend any 8K TVs as they represent a poor comparative value. It's also best to shop for a TV in the fall when prices are lower. While I do test the audio on each model, if you are serious about sound quality then buying a separate soundbar (from $100) or home theater system will instantly improve vital aspects such as speech and bass reproduction."

The LED display lights automatically dim, so you don't have to worry about any visual disruptions at night.

The duration that ice can last in a normal cooler depends greatly on how often it is opened. During testing, a cooler opened every 15 minutes lost most of its ice within hours."

    "summary": "We've been busy in the Engadget reviews department over the last few weeks, keeping up with Prime Day, product launches and the accumulating stack of devices on our desks. If you missed any of our in-depth testing recently, you can quickly catch up on the latest camera, laptop, phone and soundbar reviews in the list below. \nSamsung Galaxy Z Fold 7\n\n\nSamsung made notable design changes on its latest flagship foldable phone, finally giving the masses a significant update after a series of iterative models. Senior reviews writer Sam Rutherford argued the company \"has finally achieved foldable phone nirvana\" thanks to the reductions in overall size and thickness on the Z Fold 7, making the niche handset appeal to more users. \"With its latest flagship foldable, Samsung has removed one of the remaining barriers preventing people from trying out the new breed of phones: excessive size and weight,\" he said. \nCanon R50 V\n\n\nContent creators who are just getting into vlogging will soon realize they need a camera more robust than their phone for better quality footage. Reporter Steve Dent explained that Canon's EOS R50 V excels at video, thanks in part to its quick autofocus, but the camera lacks the performance and features of its rivals. \"Canon’s R50 V is a pretty good first try for a vlogging camera, hitting the mark in key areas like video quality and usability,\" he wrote. \"However, its rival, Sony’s ZV-E10 II, beats it in nearly every area, offering even better video quality, higher photo resolution, faster autofocus, smoother electronic stabilization and neat features missing on the R50 V — like the product showcase.\"\nSamsung HW-QS700F\n\n\nLike the Z Fold line, Samsung has been on a streak of iterative updates for its flagship soundbars. For 2025 though, the company debuted an all-new model that automatically detects how you're using it and adjusts the speaker output appropriately. It's that trick, along with crisp sound, that makes the QS700F a contender even with its constrained 3.1.2-channel audio. \"Caveats aside, the best thing about the soundbar is its automatic orientation adjustment,\" I noted. \"The QS700F is easy on the eyes too, which isn’t always the case with these devices.\"\nPanasonic S1 II\n\n\nThe S1 II may be Panasonic's best camera for content creators, but there's one major downside: the price. Steve's assessment of this model's features, which include 6K RAW video and best-in-class stabilization, will help you weigh the potential $3,200 investment. \"Panasonic’s S1 II is a powerful hybrid camera, and if it wasn’t so expensive, it would be a no-brainer for creators,\" he said. \"However, Nikon’s Z6 III has nearly the same video capabilities, is a better camera for photography and costs at least $600 less, so I’m inclined to recommend that model for most users.\"\nDell 16 Plus 2-in-1\n\n\nThe Dell 16 Plus 2-in-1 is the company's first consumer laptop to feature its recently updated naming scheme, and the change in moniker is accompanied by refreshed styling. Sam explained that while the machine is perfectly capable, especially with the optional LED display, it's lacking personality. \"It's a totally serviceable machine, but it doesn't have a single trait or feature that endears itself to its user,\" he wrote. \"Same goes for its name.\"\nBelkin Charging Case for Nintendo Switch 2\n\n\nNow that the Switch 2 is out in the wild, Nintendo's handheld console needs protection. Sam put the Belkin Charging Case through its paces to find out if it's a worthy accessory. \"I kind of wish Belkin sold a version that doesn't come with a battery for anyone who wants to use their own power pack,\" he said. \"The company’s non-charging version of this case isn’t an ideal alternative as it doesn't have much extra space inside. But even so, this kit offers a solid combination of price and practicality, which is all I'm ever really asking for.\"This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/engadget-review-recap-galaxy-z-fold-7-panasonic-s1-ii-samsung-qs700f-and-more-123027122.html?src=rss",

Canon/Engadget 83 100 Expert Score Canon EOS R50 V Canon’s EOS R50 V is a solid budget vlogging camera thanks to the excellent video quality, but it’s missing important features compared to its rivals.

Whether by choice or necessity, millions of people are turning to freelancing as a long-term business strategy. Yet the self-employed span nearly every industry and skill level, from entry-level musicians to highly specialized brand consultants. But in today's competitive job market, setting up your own gig could be the easiest way to guarantee some income. When making the leap from a conventional employee to an independent contractor, don't wipe your slate clean. Setting up a separate legal structure will give you liability protection, tax flexibility and the ability to secure loans. Though Fiverr and Upwork can help you get started, many independent contractors don't recommend relying on them as the foundation of your business. Sites like these have \"pay to play\" elements or take a percentage of each transaction as commission. If you can't afford to hire someone, try different platforms or accounting software such as QuickBooks and HoneyBook."

This kind of access is not normal, nor should it be normalized. Not so long ago, you would be right to question why a seemingly innocuous-looking free “flashlight” or “calculator” app in the app store would try to request access to your contacts, photos, and even your real-time location data. Perplexity says much of this data is stored locally on your device, but you’re still granting the company rights to access and use your personal information, including to improve its AI models for everyone else. Perplexity isn’t alone in asking for access to your data. There are serious security and privacy risks associated with using AI assistants that rely on your data. All of this for the sake of performing a task that ostensibly saves you time — or, to Whittaker’s point, saves you from having to actively think about it. When things go wrong (and they do, a lot), it’s common practice for humans at AI companies to look over your private prompts to figure out why things didn’t work. From a security and privacy point of view, a simple cost-benefit analysis of connecting AI to your most personal data just isn’t worth giving up access to your most private information. Any AI app asking for these levels of permissions should send your alarm bells ringing, just like the flashlight app wanting to know your location at any moment in time."

Inside, the G90 possesses BMW’s latest screen and capacitive touch-focused interior design. All controls are laid out in an organized manner, and their touch response is quite good.

There’s a lot to like about the newest M5, especially in its corner-carving competence.

In Texas and elsewhere, the solution is more wide-ranging than fixing any single channel of communication.

Murphy’s company is now using its mapping tools to help state and federal agencies find dozens of people still missing since the July 4th floods. Sirens can be critical for reaching people outdoors who may not have cell service and are hard to reach. But there are also warning systems that people can opt in to for alerts, including CodeRed weather warnings. Frustrations have flared up on social media this month over a statewide Blue alert issued for someone suspected of being involved in the “serious injury” of a police officer at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention facility in Alvarado, Texas. “Alert fatigue” is a concern if it pushes people to ignore warnings or opt out of receiving them altogether. “It’s really frustrating when they choose to send a Blue alert through an imminent threat channel,” Sutton says.

Generally, we've found that the best VPNs for iPhone only drop your internet download speed by an average of 25% or less. For bandwidth-demanding applications like competitive gaming or video streaming, you'll want a fast VPN. A good VPN for iPhone should run smoothly and be easy to use, regardless of your technical expertise. For instance, if you're in New York City but connected to a server in the UK, apps like Netflix will think you're across the pond.

If you're vegan, reach for plant-based bars that blend high-quality plant proteins and other whole-food ingredients like dates or oats. If you're on a tight budget, purchasing protein bars in bulk can be more cost-effective. If you're aiming to use protein bars as a meal replacement, Ti suggests sticking with bars that have a balance of all the macronutrients like protein, complex carbohydrates and healthy fats. These are some of the protein bars dietitians recommended to us and that you can pick up in store or online: Ideally, you should receive protein from whole foods like lean meats and plant-based options.

It's been quite the busy spell, with several notable games debuting or landing on more platforms and some intriguing upcoming projects popping above the parapet.\nThe Steam Automation Fest is taking place this week (it runs until July 21 at 1PM ET), so fans of games like Satisfactory and Factorio might be looking to pick up some bargains on similar titles. As well as offering a variety of discounts, Automation Fest also saw the debut of several new games.\n\nOne of them is from a studio formed by the original team from the celebrated developer Zacktronics. The first title from Coincidence (with the help of publisher Astra Logical) is Kaizen - A Factory Story. This puzzler is set in 1980s Japan, and you're tasked with building popular electronics of the day, including calculators, arcade cabinets, personal computers and toy robots.\n\nDawn Apart also arrived during Steam Automation Fest. This is a blend of space colony sim and automation sandbox set in a destructible, voxel-based world. Astra Logical is also publishing this project, which is from Industrial Technology and Witchcraft. Dawn Apart is available now on Steam in early access.\nOther new releases\n\nOne of the highest-profile indie games to debut this week is Neon Abyss 2, from Veewo Games and Kepler Ghost. The original game has sold more than a million copies, so plenty of people will have been looking forward to the sequel. This time around, you can play with up to three friends in co-op. The game's creators are promising \"unlimited item synergies\" here, which is handy since there's an onus on creating overpowered builds in this action roguelike. Neon Abyss 2 is out now on Steam in early access.\n\nReady or Not has been a hit on Steam since it arrived there in late 2023, and now Void Interactive's tactical first-person shooter has made the leap over to PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S. Here, you'll lead a team of SWAT officers in an attempt to restore order to a city that's become overrun by corruption and chaos. You can play the 18-level campaign solo or with up to five friends.\n\nBack to the Dawn is a story-driven RPG from Metal Head Games and publisher Spiral Up Games that's now out of early access on Steam. It has also arrived on Xbox Series X/S and Game Pass. \nAs Thomas the Fox, you're an investigative journalist who has been framed for revealing government secrets and tossed into prison. You'll have to forge alliances with other prisoners in your attempt to break out.\nAs part of Back to the Dawn's full launch, Metal Head is introducing a new character, Bob the Panther, as well as a fresh storyline. I like the art style here, and the premise is pretty compelling.\n\nThinking is cool and all, but sometimes you just want to turn down the volume on your brain and shoot a bunch of stuff. Kickback is an arcade bullet hell shooter with a fun twist: you can only move while you're shooting and, as the tile suggests, you'll be propelled backwards. I'm into it. Kickback — from Dot blood and publisher Targem Games — is out now on Steam.\n\nI'll be honest, I had no idea what Fretless - Wrath of Riffson was when I got an email from Steam this week telling me that this game, which I apparently had placed on my wishlist at some point, is now available. But hey, that name is an absolute winner.\nI appreciate the pixel art look of this turn-based RPG from Ritual Studios and publisher Playdigious Originals. According to the Steam page, you'll play \"as Rob, a friendly musician trying to restore harmony in an off-tuned world where wacky villains are corrupting music.\" That sounds quite lovely, actually.\nUpcoming\n\nI have absolutely no idea how Strange Scaffold does it. The studio behind I Am Your Beast, the brilliantly unsettling Clickolding and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown is about to unleash its seventh game in the space of two years. Co-Op Kaiju Horror Cooking is Strange Scaffold's first co-op game.\nThe trailer makes it look delightfully chaotic, as players rush to cook meals to satiate giant monsters and stay alive. Co-Op Kaiju Horror Cooking is out on July 29, but until then you can play the entire game for free as part of a playtest.\nWhat's more, Strange Scaffold has announced two more games: Truck-kun is Supporting Me From Another World?! is a \"chaotic anime-inspired vehicular action game about driving into objects at high speed to rescue the corporate ladder climber you accidentally isekai'd into a dangerous medieval fantasy world\" while Space Warlord Baby Trading Simulator is a \"fast-paced stock market sim about buying, selling, and shorting stocks based on the simulated lives of adorable alien children.\"\nBeautiful one-line pitches. Zero notes. Can't wait for those, or to find out about another new game demonstrating a \"unique method of developer collaboration\" that Strange Scaffold plans to unveil next week. \n\nIf you're hankering for more first-person parkour in a similar vein to Mirror's Edge, Neon White or Ghostrunner, Jetrunner might just do the trick. Riddlebit Software's platformer-shooter hybrid, which is published by Curveball Games, is coming to Steam on September 4. It looks like it could be fun! If the announcer's voice in the trailer sounds familiar, that's because the character is played by Matthew Mercer.\n\nI missed this one last week, but I just want to very quickly mention Ghost Haunting. The world needs more funny point-and-click adventures in the vein of those classic LucasArts games. Three Headed Monkey Studios and publisher Daedalic Entertainment have made a positive first impression to suggest they're ready to take that particular baton. There's no release date or window as yet, but this was an instant addition to my wishlist on Steam (let's just hope I don't forget about this one, eh?)\n\nI would love to play a tour manager simulator game at some point, getting into the nitty gritty of making sure gigs and everything else involved in a band's life on the road goes smoothly. Rockbeasts is not quite that, but it still seems like it could be a good time.\nThis is a \"grungy\" narrative-driven rock band management game from Lichthund and Team17. The trailer is fun and there are some interesting talents involved here. Rockbeasts was written by writer Jakub Szamałek, who was senior writer of The Witcher 3 and principal writer of Cyberpunk 2077. Even cooler is that Iggy Pop voices on of the characters, who is named Iggy Pup. Love it.\nRockbeasts is coming to PC and consoles next year.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/neon-abyss-2-a-prison-break-rpg-and-other-new-indie-games-worth-checking-out-110043805.html?src=rss",

Weighing just over 50 pounds, the V9 is not just on the lighter side overall, but impressively light for a model with a suspension system. Riders must add air to both the suspension system's top and bottom, which can be inconvenient. The wheel can be powered on while tilted for rider protection and will autobalance once upright. The wheel isn't loud but emits a gentle purr while riding. Charging with the included 2-amp charger takes around 5 hours, but Inmotion also offers a 10-amp fast charger that can get you back on the road in about an hour. Just top off the battery, and you're ready to roll. While it's not a touchscreen like other Inmotion models, settings can be adjusted through the Inmotion app, which is also where you can track and lock the wheel. This feature is free for the first year, with a subscription required afterward. I love how these wheels are advancing while hitting a more affordable price."

Your own games are hidden behind a tab on the Device page. This is also where you setup the virtual touch mapping for games such as Call of Duty: Mobile that don't natively support controllers. For example, after playing COD:M on the G8 Plus, I switched back to the Elo Vagabond to find it no longer worked; my phone didn't recognize it at all. But it's also pricey at $100, especially with the poor app experience. If GameSir put some work into its app, the G8 Plus would be much easier to recommend. I also wish it came with a case, but there are some on Amazon that don't look too bad."

This would be it if you're looking for a trippy series grounded in its writing and stellar performances. The futuristic anthology series explores how technology can impact humanity in various fantastic and horrific ways. It's seen by many as the best superhero show on TV, and for good reason. This updated twist on David Cronenberg's cult horror classic finds Rachel Weisz in the dual-starring role as doctors Elliott and Beverly Mantle. One could easily view the show as an ethereal work of art but there's also deep substance here.

The report states that one in 10 US counties are broadband deserts, where more than half of residents do not have access to at least 100Mbps down/20Mbps up (a definition set by the Federal Communications Commission). \"We know that it is likely an undercount because of the way they collect data. Although broadband is available to 94% of US households, according to current FCC numbers, that data doesn't account for the number of homes enrolled in an internet service. A 2024 Pew Research Center survey found that only 57% of adults making less than $30,000 a year have an internet subscription, compared to 95% of adults making at least $100,000.

De Leon agrees, adding that this monitor would also be great for anyone who is curious to explore more data when exercising. Who should not get it: This device is best for outdoor activities, so it may not be right for those who exercise indoors. Chakoian adds that she wouldn't recommend this device to \"someone who could potentially abuse this device or is only looking to move their body without any tracking of calories or workouts.\" De Leon agrees, stating, \"People who are recovering from an eating disorder or anyone who will obsess over hitting their numbers probably should skip the heart rate monitor.\""

    "summary": "If I had to describe the status of Subnautica 2 in just three words, it would be these: messy, messy, messy. That’s not to say the game itself is in terrible shape — this is actually a pivotal claim in the whole situation — but the relationship between Subnautica series developer Unknown Worlds and its parent company, Krafton, is in shreds. This month alone, Krafton fired the founders and CEO of Unknown Worlds, Subnautica 2 was delayed until 2026 and the ousted leaders filed a lawsuit against Krafton, looking to regain creative control of the game and the studio. At the center of the conflict is a bonus payment worth up to $250 million.\nHere’s a rundown of how we got here and what in the devil is going on with Subnautica 2, Krafton and Unknown Worlds.\nKrafton\nCharlie Cleveland accidentally started Unknown Worlds in 2001 while building the popular Half-Life mods Natural Selection and Natural Selection 2, and technical director Max McGuire came on as an official studio co-founder in 2006. Inspired by Minecraft and burned out on mods, Unknown Worlds began working on the undersea, open-world exploration game Subnautica and released it in early access on Steam in 2014. With years of community feedback, the game evolved into a singularly tense and rich survival experience, and version 1.0 officially landed in 2018. This is also when Ted Gill joined the studio’s executive team, freeing up Cleveland to focus on creative direction. Subnautica and its spin-off, Subnautica: Below Zero, attracted millions of players and established Unknown Worlds as a successful independent team.\nSo, the larger studios came sniffing. PUBG publisher Krafton, which operates with billions of dollars annually, purchased Unknown Worlds in 2021 for $500 million. The acquisition came with the promise of an additional payout worth up to $250 million if Unknown Worlds hit certain performance goals by the end of 2025. This bonus is a critical piece of the chaos today.\nWe know more about the details of this deal thanks to recent reporting by Bloomberg. In addition to the leadership positions, which were filled by Cleveland, Gill and McGuire, Unknown Worlds had about 40 employees at the time of the Krafton sale, and they received payouts totaling $50 million at closing and over the following two years. This larger group was poised to receive as much as $25 million in the 2025 performance-based earnout, with each person expecting a different amount, but most estimating six or seven figures. The remaining $225 million was reserved for the Unknown Worlds leadership, but they said they intended to share a portion of their windfall with employees who weren’t included in the bonus, covering the full studio headcount of about 100 people.\nKrafton\nThe leadership of Unknown Worlds repeated this promise in a lawsuit filed against Krafton on July 10, 2025. But we’re getting ahead of ourselves.\nAfter the acquisition, Unknown Worlds continued updating Subnautica and Below Zero. In February 2024, the studio released Moonbreaker, a turn-based strategy game that never really took off, partially because of its initial microtransaction system. Since then, the studio has been focused on Subnautica 2. The game was officially announced in October 2024 with a prospective early access launch window of 2025. It’s currently the second-most wishlisted game on Steam, after Hollow Knight: Silksong.\nThe first public notion that something was rotten between Unknown Worlds and Krafton came on July 2, when Cleveland, Gill and McGuire were fired and replaced by former Callisto Protocol studio head Steve Papoutsis. Krafton didn’t provide a reason for the switch-up in its press release, instead offering the following nearly complete thought: “While Krafton sought to keep the Unknown Worlds’ co-founders and original creators of the Subnautica series involved in the game’s development, the company wishes them well on their next endeavors.”\nKrafton didn’t mention delaying the early access launch at this time, but it implemented a review process that it said would be “essential to delivering the right game at the right time.” The publisher suggested the ousted leaders had been uncooperative in this aspect.\n“Unknown Worlds’ new leadership fully supports this process and is committed to meeting player expectations,” its press release said.\nCleveland published a blog post on July 4 reflecting on his time in game development, and sharing his disappointment at Krafton’s handling of Unknown Worlds and Subnautica 2. He also referenced Krafton’s intent to delay the launch.\n“You can see why for Max, Ted, myself, the Unknown Worlds team, and for our community, the events of this week have been quite a shock,” Cleveland wrote. “We know that the game is ready for early access release and we know you’re ready to play it. And while we thought this was going to be our decision to make, at least for now, that decision is in Krafton’s hands. And after all these years, to find that I’m no longer able to work at the company I started stings.”\nOn July 9, Krafton officially delayed the early access launch of Subnautica 2 to 2026. That same day, Bloomberg published a report outlining the performance-based bonus agreement and implicitly questioning how the timing of the delay would make it difficult for the studio to hit its goals, putting the payout in jeopardy. This was the first time the details of the bonus became public.\nKrafton shared a statement with Engadget — and in a pop-up on its own homepage — on July 10 that straight-up accused the fired leaders of abandoning the studio in favor of personal creative pursuits, specifically calling out Cleveland’s film production company. It also threw shade at Moonbreaker and claimed the former bosses wanted the bonus payment “for themselves.”\nKrafton\n“Krafton made multiple requests to Charlie and Max to resume their roles as Game Director and Technical Director, respectively, but both declined to do so,” the statement said. “In particular, following the failure of Moonbreaker, Krafton asked Charlie to devote himself to the development of Subnautica 2. However, instead of participating in the game development, he chose to focus on a personal film project. Krafton believes that the absence of core leadership has resulted in repeated confusion in direction and significant delays in the overall project schedule. The current Early Access version also falls short in terms of content volume.”\nThat same day, Cleveland announced that he and the other ousted studio heads had filed a lawsuit against Krafton.\n“Suing a multibillion dollar company in a painful, public and possibly protracted way was certainly not on my bucket list,” Cleveland wrote. “But this needs to be made right. Subnautica has been my life’s work and I would never willingly abandon it or the amazing team that has poured their hearts into it. As for the earnout, the idea that Max, Ted and I wanted to keep it all for ourselves is totally untrue.”\nThe lawsuit wasn’t unsealed until July 16. But on July 15, Bloomberg reported that Krafton now planned to extend the window for the bonus payment by an additional year, giving the studio more time to hit its goals. The publisher will also reportedly advance a portion of a separate profit-sharing bonus pool to all Unknown Worlds employees in 2025.\nThese moves seem designed to moot the core issues raised in the breach of contract complaint that Cleveland and other Unknown Worlds leaders filed against Krafton in Delaware Chancery Court. The lawsuit, unsealed on July 16, claims Krafton illegally fired the studio heads and delayed Subnautica 2 in order to avoid the bonus payments. It also provides a timeline of growing tensions between the founders and Krafton this year, accusing the publisher of intentional sabotage.\nThe lawsuit claims that Krafton and Unknown Worlds had a respectful relationship until April 2025, when Gill presented Krafton executives with the studio’s positive revenue projections, which were made with the assumption that Subnautica 2 would hit early access in 2025. He also outlined the expected bonus payout under the agreement.\n“When that happened, everything changed,” the lawsuit reads.\nThe complaint alleges that at this point, Krafton began looking for ways to force out the leaders of Unknown Worlds and delay the launch of Subnautica 2, with a goal of circumventing the bonus payment. Cleveland, Gill and McGuire argued back and forth with Krafton executives over whether the game was ready for early access, and Krafton eventually pulled all of its resources from the studio. Krafton issued a stop order on Subnautica 2 development, took over Unknown Worlds’ communications channels and in June it started laying an internal paper trail accusing the founders of abandoning their fiduciary duties, according to the complaint.\nCleveland, Gill and McGuire were fired and removed from the Unknown Worlds board of directors on July 1. This is where the rest of us entered the story.\n\nThe main conflict here is over whether Subnautica 2 is really ready for an early access launch, and that matters because of a potential $250 million bonus payment that’s jeopardized by a delay. Not only is this a large sum for Krafton to lose, but it’s also a massive amount of money for Cleveland, Gill and McGuire to miss out on, especially now that they’ve lost their studio and tentpole IP. The ousted leaders reiterated in their lawsuit that they “planned to share even more of the earnout with their dedicated team” than they were contractually obligated to. In the complaint, they’re looking for Krafton to pay out the full bonus as projected without a delay, fulfill its obligations as a publisher and reinstate them as the heads of Unknown Worlds.\nEvery party in this situation claims they want what’s best for Subnautica 2 and its players. It’s possible that they’re all telling the truth and this is a simple disagreement over artistic integrity. It’s also possible that they’re all lying and everyone is looking to make (or keep) a quick buck — but man, that’s bleak. The truth, as usual, likely lies somewhere in between and, chances are, we’ll never know it. At least the court system will eventually be able to determine the second-best thing, which is who’s at fault.\n\nHave a tip for Jessica?

    "summary": "Netflix admitted during its earnings call on Thursday that it used generative AI to create VFX in The Eternaut, a Netflix original from Argentina that was released in April 2025. The company's co-CEO Ted Sarandos said that generative AI was specifically used for a VFX shot in the post-apocalyptic drama, but the move is one of several ways Netflix is embracing AI.\nAccording to Sarandos, the creators of The Eternaut wanted to include a shot of building collapsing in Buenos Aires, and rather than contract a studio of visual effects artists to create the footage, Netflix used generative AI to create it. \"Using AI powered tools, they were able to achieve an amazing result with remarkable speed,\" Sarandos shared during the earnings call. \"In fact, that VFX sequence was completed 10 times faster than it could have been completed with... traditional VFX tools and workflows.\"\nThe shot \"just wouldn't have been feasible for a show on that budget,\" Sarandos says, as someone with some input on the show's budget. The executive says that The Eternaut features \"the very first Gen AI final footage to appear on screen in a Netflix original series or film.\" Clearly, the show is also a prototype for how Netflix can avoid costs it doesn't want to swallow in the future.\nWorkers in the entertainment industry have not taken kindly to the use of generative AI. Labor strikes — including the recently resolved SAG-AFTRA video game strike — have made securing protections against AI a central issue. The Oscar-nominated film The Brutalist came under fire in 2024 for using AI tools during production. Beyond that, whether generative AI models were illegally trained on copyrighted material is still an open question.\nNetflix plans to use generative AI to create ads for its ad-support Netflix subscription, and the company is reportedly testing a new search feature powered by OpenAI models. Using generative AI in production might seem par for the course for a company that's already invested, but it could help to normalize a technology that many creatives remain actively against.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/netflix-is-already-using-generative-ai-in-its-original-shows-201209502.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Meta said on Friday that it won't sign the European Union's new AI code of practice. The guidelines provide a framework for the EU's AI Act, which regulates companies operating in the European Union.\nThe EU's code of practice is voluntary, so Meta was under no legal obligation to sign it. Yet Meta's Chief Global Affairs Officer, Joel Kaplan, made a point to publicly knock the guidelines on Friday. He described the code as \"over-reach.\"\n\"Europe is heading down the wrong path on AI,\" Kaplan posted in a statement. \"We have carefully reviewed the European Commission’s Code of Practice for general-purpose AI (GPAI) models and Meta won’t be signing it. This Code introduces a number of legal uncertainties for model developers, as well as measures which go far beyond the scope of the AI Act.\"\nSo, why kick up a (public) fuss about not signing something Meta was under no obligation to sign? Well, this isn't the first time the company has waged a PR battle against Europe's AI regulations. It previously called the AI Act \"unpredictable,\" claiming \"it goes too far\" and is \"hampering innovation and holding back developers.\" In February, Meta's public policy director said, \"The net result of all of that is that products get delayed or get watered down and European citizens and consumers suffer.\"\nOutmuscling the EU may seem like a more attainable goal to Meta, given that it has an anti-regulation ally in the White House. In April, President Trump pressured the EU to abandon the AI Act. He described the rules as \"a form of taxation.\"\nMark Zuckerberg at Trump's inauguration in JanuaryPool via Getty Images\nThe EU published its code of practice on July 10. It includes tangible guidelines to help companies follow the AI Act. Among other things, the code bans companies from training AI on pirated materials and requires them to respect requests from writers and artists to omit their work from training data. It also requires developers to provide regularly updated documentation describing their AI features.\nAlthough signing the code of practice is voluntary, doing so has its perks. Agreeing to it can give companies more legal protection against future accusations of breaching the AI Act. Thomas Regnier, the European Commission's spokesperson for digital matters, added more color in a statement to Bloomberg. He said that AI providers who don't sign it \"will have to demonstrate other means of compliance.\" As a consequence, they \"may be exposed to more regulatory scrutiny.\"\nCompanies that violate the AI Act can face hefty penalties. The European Commission can impose fines of up to seven percent of a company's annual sales. The penalties are a lower three percent for those developing advanced AI models.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/meta-says-it-wont-sign-the-eus-ai-code-of-practice-190132690.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "The new SS7 bypass attack tricks phone operators into disclosing a cell subscriber's location, in some cases down to a few hundred meters.",
    "full_text": "The attack relies on bypassing security protections that carriers have put in place to protect intruders from accessing SS7, or Signaling System 7, a private set of protocols used by the global phone carriers to route subscribers’ calls and text messages around the world. SS7 also allows the carriers to request information about which cell tower a subscriber’s phone is connected to, typically used for accurately billing customers when they call or text someone from overseas, for example. Researchers at Enea, a cybersecurity company that provides protections for phone carriers, said this week that they have observed the unnamed surveillance vendor exploiting the new bypass attack as far back as late 2024 to obtain the locations of people’s phones without their knowledge. Mc Daid told TechCrunch that the attack was part of an increasing trend in malicious operators using these kinds of exploits to obtain a person’s location, warning that the vendors behind their use “would not be discovering and using them if they were not successful somewhere.” “We anticipate that more will be found and used,” Mc Daid said. Surveillance vendors, which can include spyware makers and providers of bulk internet traffic, are private companies that typically work exclusively for government customers to conduct intelligence-gathering operations against individuals. Governments often claim to use spyware and other exploitative technologies against serious criminals, but the tools have also been used to target members of civil society, including journalists and activists. But due to the nature of these attacks happening at the cell network level, there is little that phone subscribers can do to defend against exploitation. Rather, defending against these attacks rests largely on the telecom companies. In recent years, phone companies have installed firewalls and other cybersecurity protections to defend against SS7 attacks, but the patchwork nature of the global cell network means that not all carriers are as protected as others, including in the United States."

DuckDuckGo’s new feature comes as the internet is being flooded with AI slop, which refers to low-quality media content made using generative AI technology. “The filter relies on manually curated open-source blocklists, including the ‘nuclear’ list, provided by uBlockOrigin and uBlacklist Huge AI Blocklist,” DuckDuckGo said in a post on X. “While it won’t catch 100% of AI-generated results, it will greatly reduce the number of AI-generated images you see.” DuckDuckGo says it plans on adding additional filters in the future, but didn’t provide specifics. It’s worth noting that DuckDuckGo’s example for the new feature depicts an image search for a baby peacock, likely in reference to Google facing controversy last year for showing more AI-generated images of baby peacocks rather than real-life images when conducting an image search for the bird."

    "summary": "We tested all the major live TV streaming services and, after comparing the features and costs, we still think they are a better deal than paying for cable or satellite — but the gulf between the options is narrowing. Now that most subscriptions go for more than $80 per month, live TV streaming is not the amazing deal it once was.Still, there’s no contract, the pricing is simpler and you don’t need any special equipment beyond a smart TV and an internet connection. Our current top choice is YouTube TV; It’s the most well-rounded option that should please anyone looking for live sports, linear cable-style channels and/or local networks. But other services have their advantages, too, depending on what you want to watch. Here are the best live TV streaming services according to our tests.\nTable of contents\n\nBest live TV streaming services for 2025\nBest free live TV streaming services for 2025\nWhat to look for in a live TV streaming service\nHow we tested\nLive TV Streaming FAQs\nRecent updates\n\nBest live TV streaming services for 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to top \nBest free live TV streaming services for 2025\nThere are plenty of ways to get free TV these days. To start, many standard streaming apps have added live components to their lineups. You’re paying for the service, so it’s not technically “free,” but you can get a dose of live TV without spending more than necessary. Peacock includes some regional NBC stations, and notably access to the 2024 Summer Olympic Games. Paramount+ subscribers can watch on-air CBS programming. The standard Hulu app has a live ABC news channel and Max now includes a live CNN outlet with its service, along with cable-like linear channels.\nThe smart TV operating system (OS) you use likely provides free live content too: Amazon’s Fire TV interface has a live tab and Roku’s built-in Roku Channel includes hundreds of live channels at no extra cost. The same goes for Samsung TV Plus, which added a trove of K-dramas to its free live and on-demand lineup in 2024. The PBS app offers local live streams of its channels — even NASA has a free streaming service with live coverage. \nBut for a full suite of live TV networks, and don’t want to sign up for any paid service, there are a number of free ad-supported TV services that have live TV. Even cable company DirecTV has joined the crowd with MyFree, and Fubo Free lets customers with a lapsed subscription keep watching some content. Here's the best of the live TV streaming services we tried:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to top\nWhat to look for in a live TV streaming service\nHow to stream live TV\nStreaming live TV is a lot like using Netflix. You get access through apps on your phone, tablet, smart TV or streaming device and the signal arrives over the internet. A faster and more stable connection tends to give you a better experience. Most live TV apps require you to sign up and pay via a web browser. After that, you can activate the app on all of your devices.\nMonthly Price\nWhen I started testing these cord-cutting alternatives, I was struck by the price difference between live TV and a standard video streaming app. Where the latter cost between $5 and $20 per month, most live TV services hit the $80 mark and can go higher than $200 with additional perks, channel packages and premium extras. The higher starting price is mostly due to the cost of providing multiple networks — particularly sports and local stations. And, in the past year or so, every service except Sling has raised base plan prices.\nLocal channels\nOnly two of the services I tried don’t include full local channel coverage for subscribers and one of those makes no effort to carry sports at all. That would be Philo and, as you might guess, it’s the cheapest. The next most affordable option, Sling, only carries three local stations — and only in larger markets — but it still manages to include some of the top sports channels.\nWhen you sign up with any provider that handles local TV, you’ll enter your zip code, ensuring you get your area’s broadcast affiliates for ABC, CBS, FOX and NBC. Of course, you can also get those stations for free. Nearly all modern television sets support a radio frequency (RF) connection, also known as the coaxial port, which means if you buy an HD antenna, you’ll receive locally broadcast stations like ABC, CBS, PBS, FOX and NBC. And since the signal is digital, reception is much improved over the staticky rabbit-ears era.\nBut local channel access is another area where traditional streaming services, like Netflix, are bleeding into broadcast territory. For example, you can watch your local NBC station with a Peacock subscription and you can tune into your area’s CBS station through your Paramount+ subscription. Netflix is even getting into the mix with a recently announced deal with one of France’s broadcast companies, TF1. The streaming service will now air TF1's live TV channels and on-demand content inside the Netflix app. No word if the concept will expand to other regions, but it’s an interesting move to anyone interested in the future of streaming.\nLive sports coverage\nOne reality that spun my head was the sheer number and iterations of sports networks in existence. Trying to figure out which network will carry the match-up you want to see can be tricky. I found that Google makes it a little easier for sports fans by listing out upcoming games (just swap in NBA, NFL, MLB, NHL and so on in the search bar). When you click an event, the “TV & streaming” button will tell you which network is covering it.\nThat just leaves figuring out if your chosen service carries the RSNs (regional sports networks) you want. Unfortunately, even with add-ons and extra packages, some providers simply don’t have certain channels in their lineups. It would take a lawyer to understand the ins and outs of streaming rights negotiations, and networks leave and return to live TV carriers all the time. That said, most major sporting events in the US are covered by ESPN, Fox Sports, TNT, USA and local affiliates.\nI should also point out that traditional streaming services have started adding live sports to their lineups. Peacock carries live Premier League matches, Sunday Night Football games and aired the 2024 Olympic Games from Paris. Thursday Night Football as well as NBA and WNBA games are on Amazon Prime and Christmas Day Football aired on Netflix. Max (formerly HBO Max) now airs select, regular season games from the NHL, MLB, NCAA and NBA with a $10-per-month add-on. You can watch MLS games with an add-on through the Apple TV app, and Apple TV+ includes some MLB games. Roku users can watch the just-added free sports channel and those who subscribe to Paramount Plus can see many of the matches aired on CBS Sports, including live NFL games. This year, even the Super Bowl was live-streamed for free on Tubi. While all of these alternatives may not cover as much ground as live TV streamers, they could end up being cheaper avenues to the sports you want.\nAnd if sports is all you’re after, there are sports-only plans that are a touch cheaper, too. The promised sports streaming service from ESPN, Fox and Warner Bros. called Venu was cancelled early this year. But in May, ESPN confirmed it will launch its own streaming service that will include all ESPN channels, though a start date hasn’t been confirmed. DirecTV recently  announced a $70-per-month, sports-only streaming package called MySports and Comcast now has a sports and news bundle for the same price (as long as you're an Xfinity customer with auto-pay, otherwise it's more expensive).\nTraditional cable networks\nDozens of linear programming networks were once only available with cable TV, like Bravo, BET, Food Network, HGTV, CNN, Lifetime, SYFY and MTV. If you only subscribe to, say, Netflix or Apple TV+, you won’t have access to those. But as with sports, standard streamers are starting to incorporate this content into their offerings. After the Warner Bros. merger, Max incorporated some content from HGTV, Discovery and TLC. Peacock has Bravo and Hallmark shows, and Paramount+ has material from Nickelodeon, MTV and Comedy Central.\nOther channels like AMC+ have stand-alone apps. The Discovery+ app gives you 15 channels ad-free for $9 per month (or with ads for $5 monthly). And a service called Frndly TV starts at a mere $7 per month and streams A&E, Lifetime, Game Show Network, Outdoor Channel and about 35 others. Of course, most live TV streaming options will deliver more sizable lists of cable networks, but just note that you may already be paying for some of them — and if all you need is a certain channel, you could get it cheaper by subscribing directly.\nOn-demand streaming\nMost live TV subscriptions include access to a selection of video-on-demand (VOD) content, like you would get with a traditional streaming service. Much of this content is made up of the movies and TV series that have recently aired on your subscribed networks. This typically doesn’t cover live events and news programming, but I was able to watch specific episodes of ongoing shows like Top Chef or BET’s Diarra from Detroit. Just search the on-demand library for the program, pick an episode and hit play.\nPartnerships, like Hulu’s relationship with Disney, and add-ons, such as bundling Max with your YouTube TV subscription or Starz with your Sling plan, will let you watch even larger libraries of on-demand content. But again, if VOD is all you’re after, paying for those networks directly instead of through a live TV plan will be far cheaper.\nDigital video recordings (DVR) limits\nEvery option I tried offers some cloud DVR storage without needing a separate physical device. You’ll either get unlimited storage for recordings that expires after nine months or a year, or you’ll get a set number of hours (between 50 and 1,000) that you can keep indefinitely. Typically, all you need to do is designate what ongoing TV series you want to record and the DVR component will do all the hard work of saving subsequent episodes for you to watch later. You can do the same thing with sports events.\nAside from being able to watch whenever it’s most convenient, you can also fast-forward through commercials in recorded content. In contrast, you can’t skip them on live TV or VOD.\nSimultaneous streams and profiles per account\nEach plan gives you a certain number of simultaneous streams, aka how many screens can play content at the same time. And while most providers will let you travel with your subscription, there are usually location restrictions that require you to sign in from your home IP address periodically. Stream allowances range from one at a time to unlimited screens (or as many as your ISP’s bandwidth can handle). Some plans require add-ons to get more screens.\nMost services also let you set up a few profiles so I was able to give different people in my family the ability to build their own watch histories and libraries, set their favorite channels and get individual recommendations.\nPicture-in-picture mode and multiview\nPicture-in-picture (PiP) usually refers to shrinking a video window on a mobile device or computer browser so you can watch it while using other apps. Sling, YouTube TV, FuboTV, Philo, DirecTV Stream and Hulu + Live TV all have PiP modes on computers and mobile devices. Another feature, multiview, lets you view multiple live sports games at once on your TV screen. YouTube TV and FuboTV are the only live TV streamers that let you do this. With YouTube TV, you can select up to four views from a few preset selection of streams. FuboTV offers the same feature, but only if you're using an Apple TV or Roku streaming device.\n4K live streams\nRight now, just FuboTV, YouTube TV and DirecTV Stream offer 4K live streams — but with caveats. YouTube TV requires a $20-per-month add-on, after which you’ll only be able to watch certain live content in 4K. DirecTV Stream has three channels that show live 4K content — one with shows and original series, and two with occasional sporting events. You don’t have to pay extra for these but you do need to have either DirecTV’s Gemini receiver, or a device from Fire TV, Apple TV or Roku. You’ll need those same streaming devices to watch the select 4K programming on Sling as well. FuboTV shows certain live events in 4K but access is limited to the Elite and Premier packages, not the base-level Pro plan.\nOf course, watching any 4K content also requires equipment that can handle it: a 4K smart TV or 4K streaming device paired with a cord and screen that can handle 4K resolution.\nTiers, packages and add-ons\nComparing price-to-offering ratios is a task for a spreadsheet. I… made three. The base plans range from $28 to $85 per month. From there, you can add packages, which are usually groups of live TV channels bundled by themes like news, sports, entertainment or international content. Premium VOD extras like Max, AMC+ and Starz are also available. Add-ons cost an extra $5 to $20 each per month and simply show up in the guide where you find the rest of your live TV. This is where streaming can quickly get expensive, pushing an $80 subscription to $200 monthly, depending on what you choose.\nHow to stream live TV for free\nI also downloaded and tried out a few apps that offer free ad-supported TV (FAST) including Freevee, Tubi, PlutoTV and Sling Freestream. These let you drop in and watch a more limited selection of live networks at zero cost. Most don’t even require an email address, let alone a credit card. And if you have a Roku device, an Amazon Fire TV or Stick, a Samsung TV, a Chromecast device or a Google TV, you already have access to hundreds of live channels via the Roku Channel, the live tab in Fire TV, through the Samsung TV Plus app or through Google TV.\nBack to top\nHow we tested\nWhen I begin testing for a guide, I research the most popular and well-reviewed players in the category and narrow down which are worth trying. For the paid plans, just six services dominate so I tried them all. There are considerably more free live TV contenders so I tested the four most popular. After getting accounts set up using my laptop, I downloaded the apps on a Samsung smart TV running the latest version of Tizen OS. I counted the local stations and regional sports coverage, and noted how many of the top cable networks were available. I then weighed the prices, base packages and available add-ons.\nI then looked at how the programming was organized in each app’s UI and judged how easy everything was to navigate, from the top navigation to the settings. To test the search function, I searched for the same few TV shows on BET, Food Network, HGTV and Comedy Central, since all six providers carry those channels. I noted how helpful the searches were and how quickly they got me to season 6, episode 13 of Home Town.\nI used DVR to record entire series and single movies and watched VOD shows, making sure to test the pause and scan functions. On each service with sports, I searched for the same four upcoming NHL, NBA, MLS and NCAA basketball matches and used the record option to save the games and play them back a day or two later. Finally, I noted any extra perks or irritating quirks.\nAll live TV streaming services we’ve tested:\n\nPhilo\nSling\nYouTube TV\nHulu + Live TV\nDirecTV Stream\nFuboTV\nFreevee\nTubi\nPlutoTV\nSling Freestream\nPlex\n\nBack to top\nLive TV Streaming FAQs\nWhat is live streaming?\nStreaming simply refers to video content that is delivered to your screen over the internet. Live streaming can be split into two categories: linear programming and simultaneous transmission. That first one is similar to what you get with cable or broadcast TV, with channels that play a constant flow of movies and shows (sort of what TV looked like before Netflix). Simultaneous streaming lets you watch live events (like a basketball game) or a program (like the evening news) as they happen.\nWhat is the difference between streaming and live streaming?\nStandard streaming, the most popular example being Netflix, lets you pick what you want to watch from a menu of choices. It’s also referred to as “video on demand.” Live streaming refers to sports and news events that you can stream as they happen in real time. It also refers to channels that show a continuous, linear flow of programming.\nWhat streaming service is best for live TV?\nFuboTV does the best job of letting you organize live channels to help you find just what you want to watch. The interface is uncluttered and when you search for something, the UI clearly tells you whether something is live now or on-demand. YouTube TV also does a good job making that info clear. Both have just over 100 live channels on offer.\nWhat is the most cost effective TV streaming service?\nFree TV streaming services like PlutoTV, Plex, Tubi and FreeVee show plenty of ad-supported TV shows and movies without charging you anything. Of course, they won’t have the same channels or content that more premium subscriptions have. Ultimately it depends on what you want to watch and finding the service that can supply that to you in the most streamlined form so you’re not paying for stuff you don’t need.\nIs it cheaper to have cable or streaming?\nA basic cable package used to be more expensive than the base-level live TV streaming service. But now that nearly all major providers have raised their prices to over $75 per month, that’s no longer the case. And with add-ons and other premiums, you can easily pay over $200 a month for either cable or a live TV streaming service.\nWhat streaming service has all the TV channels?\nNo service that we tested had every available channel. Hulu + Live TV and DirecTV Stream carry the the highest number of the top rated channels, according to Neilsen. Hulu’s service also gets you Disney+ fare, which you can’t get elsewhere. FuboTV has the most sports channels and YouTube TV gives you the widest selection of add-ons.\nWhat is the most popular live TV streaming platform?\nYouTube TV has the most paying customers. According to 2024's letter from the CEO, the service has over eight million subscribers. Disney’s 2024 third quarter earnings put the Hulu + Live TV viewer count at 4.6 million. Sling’s customer count dipped from two million to about 1.9 million in 2024 and FuboTV grew its subscriber list to 1.6 million.\nHow safe are free streaming services and websites?\nYou may have heard certain sites that provide free content can be dangerous, leading to stolen info and/or exposing you to malware. That’s likely in reference to certain peer-to-peer (P2P) networks and file-sharing sites that let people download free movies and series — which can come bundled with malicious code.\nBut if you’re talking about the free ad-supported streaming television (FAST) services listed here, from providers like PlutoTV, Tubi and Freevee, they are just as safe as any other streaming service. Since you sometimes don’t even have to provide your email address or credit card info, they can even be more anonymous than apps that require login credentials.\nBack to top\nRecent updates\nJanuary 31, 2025: Added information about which streaming service would live-stream the Super Bowl, including Tubi’s free option. Updated Fubo’s pricing. Added details about DirectTV Stream’s sports-only package and Comcast’s sports and news bundle.\nJanuary 16, 2025: Included higher prices for Sling’s Orange and Blue plans. Noted the demise of the never-launched Venu sports streaming service and mentioned the inclusion of DirecTV’s new sports package.\nDecember 31, 2024: Noted increased pricing for YouTube TV, Hulu+ Live TV and DirecTV. Updated information for 4K streaming capabilities and requirements for multiple services. Reported on the upcoming shut down of Amazon’s Freevee service and the addition of DirecTV’s free service.\nAugust 6, 2024: Updated with the addition of Plex as a free live TV streaming recommendation and mentioned the additional free channels Philo is now including with the free version of its service. Added pricing information for ESPN's new sports-only streaming service, Venu. \nJune 12, 2024: Updated with more information about 4K live streaming, picture-in-picture and multiview modes, as well as video on-demand options. We expanded our recommendations around free live TV streaming services and added a FAQ query about the safety of free streaming services and clarified the difference between standard and live streaming. More traditional streaming services have added live and sports components, so we revised that section accordingly.\nBack to topThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/best-live-tv-streaming-service-133000410.html?src=rss",

The same goes for Samsung TV Plus, which added a trove of K-dramas to its free live and on-demand lineup in 2024. The FAST service has around 800 live TV channels that are organized fairly granularly and you can have up to 15 profiles. There was once a nifty integration with notable music streaming service Tidal, but that collaboration sadly came to an end late in 2024. Aside from being able to watch whenever it’s most convenient, you can also fast-forward through commercials in recorded content.

    "summary": "Samsung announced its newest devices during its Galaxy Unpacked event on July 9. That happened to fall on the second day of Amazon’s Prime Day event. Do big tech companies not know what the others are doing? Do they care? Do they like making the lives of tech reporters difficult? I didn’t have time to consider. Only when I was done covering Amazon did I have time to begin properly testing Samsung’s latest wearable. That means I’ve been living with the Galaxy Watch 8 for four days now.\nWhile that’s not enough time to complete a comprehensive review and tally a fair score, I was able to gather a good amount of first impressions — and let me tell you, they are nearly all positive. I’ll continue to evaluate the watch over the next few weeks or so and return for a final assessment. In the meantime, there’s a lot to say about the experience so far. \nSamsung packed a lot of updates into its latest smartwatch, in terms of both hardware and software. But I put extra effort into testing one feature in particular — and it’s one of the more interesting.\nAntioxidant tests and my persimmon intake\nThe Galaxy Watch 8 has the same processor and sensors as the previous generation, but it’s using those to detect a new metric: antioxidant levels. You have to take the watch off and hold your thumb on the sensor node for five seconds to get a reading and you’ll need to refer to the Health app in your phone for detailed results. The first time I tested, I got a score of 60, which falls right in the middle of the “low” segment of the scale. The only other results are “very low” and “adequate,” which will surely be a disappointment to the over-achievers out there.\nThe Health app suggested I “try eating one (100g) persimmon today.” When my grandmother was alive, she made persimmon cookies every Christmas and the last time she did so was also the last time I thought about that fruit. Considering South Korea is one of the world’s largest persimmon producers, it might make sense that a Samsung device suggested them. The produce guy at my local grocery store said they only carry them around the holidays (no doubt because grandmas insist, plus that’s when they’re in season).\nTurns out persimmons are high in antioxidants such as Vitamin C and beta-carotine (Vitamin A). Cantaloupe also has those nutrients — plus it’s orange like persimmons — so I bought one. In fact, I went hard on the antioxidants and did everything I could to see if I could get a better score. I ate a bunch of cherries and a little dark chocolate. For breakfast, I had half a cantaloupe instead of the very tasty-smelling breakfast hash my husband made, and I drank plain green tea instead of my usual oat matcha latte. I did yoga and went to my monthly medical massage appointment (stress is said to increase oxidant levels). I got eight hours of sleep and drank my weight in water. I felt ready.\nSo I took the test again and my antioxidant levels were… two points lower. Sigh. I wasn’t expecting overnight transformation, but I’d hoped for a little improvement. Next time, I’m eating the hash.\nFinally, a new design!\nSince its fourth generation, the Galaxy Watch has looked pretty much the same: a round glass screen set in a round metal case with large prongs popping out of the top and bottom to hold the band. While there was nothing wrong with sticking with a good design, giving a device a refreshed look lends the yearly update cycle some meaning — instead of feeling like an obligatory move to appease stockholders.\n\n\n\n  With 3,000 nits of peak brightness, the watch is easy to read even in the bright Albuquerque sun. \n \n\n  Amy Skorheim for Engadget\n \n\nThis time around, the Galaxy Watch 8 looks markedly different thanks to a shape borrowed from last year’s Ultra model. Samsung calls it a “cushion design” — a circular glass display set atop an aluminum case that looks like a roundish square (or squircle as our own Cherlynn Low calls it). The Sport band on my review model curves to meet the width of the case, creating a smooth arch that I think is more refined than the clunkier pronged configuration. In fact, the entire look is classy — much more so than the Apple Watch, which looks like a miniaturized iPhone 11 glued to a silicone strap.\nThe cushion design is great in one way, but also worrisome. Because the glass display stands proud of the case by at least two millimeters, my first thought was: “I’m going to trash this screen.” Immediately after taking the watch out of the box, I ordered screen shields and, during the short course of this review, managed to crack one. That’s possibly because I was cheap and ordered off-brand screen protectors, or perhaps the protruding glass cushion is simply begging for misfortune.\n\n\nHowever, the raised glass solves one complaint I had with the Galaxy Watch 7. One way to scroll is by running your finger along the outer edge of the screen. In fact, on-screen cues suggest that gesture when there’s more content to view. On the Watch 7, my finger was always getting in the way of the text I wanted to read. Now that the display is elevated, there’s room for my finger to travel further out along the outer edge and stay out of the way.\nAppearance aside, my favorite hardware update is how much more comfortable the watch is. The Watch 7’s underside had a sizable sensor node, and it took me a week to get used to the feel. Even then, I hated sleeping with it. The Watch 8, however, felt good the first time I put it on.\nGemini on your wrist and Wear OS 6\nThe Galaxy Watch 8 is the first smartwatch to ship with Google’s Wear OS 6, though Samsung overlays it with its own One UI interface. The headline feature for the new software is Gemini integration. Now, most things you can do with the Gemini app on your phone can be done through your watch. Just note that you’ll need to have your Gemini-compatible phone nearby to use it.\n\n\n\n\n  Amy Skorheim for Engadget\n \n\nGoogle’s AI was pretty snappy at basic tasks like setting reminders and timers. Requests that required more “thought” took only marginally longer (and completed more quickly when I was using my home Wi-Fi versus relying on cell signals out in the world). I asked for the best record stores in my city and a good place to eat lunch. I was pleasantly surprised to hear of a new-to-me answer for each category. The record store turned out to be two bins of LPs inside a book shop, but still, I hadn’t heard of it before. I asked why my eight-year-old talked about lava chicken all the time and was correctly informed about Jack Black and A Minecraft Movie.\nThe assistant displays answers in text form on the watch screen and also reads out every word. That can turn into a lot of talking, but tapping the screen stops the chatter if you prefer to read. Gemini can handle follow-up questions and tasks, but since it doesn’t usually keep listening after it speaks, you have to tap the mic icon to make your next request. \nI reached out to Samsung to ask if I could change a setting to make Gemini keep listening, but there isn't one at this time. For now, you'll need to tap or say \"OK Google\" again for followups like, “Add that to my Google Keep” or “Remind me about that.” If Gemini asks you a question, however, such as verifying a text it’s about to send, it does keep listening for the answer. You can also combine commands at the outset, such as asking to look up an address and text it to someone. \nI requested some fairly specific tasks and didn’t hit any snags. I asked it to text the address of a local restaurant to my husband and it verified which location I wanted then sent the message. I asked when the Albuquerque Isotopes were playing the Sacramento River Cats and it gave me the upcoming dates. I tapped the mic and said, “add that to my calendar,” which it did.\nIt only let me down twice. When I asked whether it was going to rain, it just read me the general weather forecast instead of answering the question. All the other assistants in my life (Alexa and Siri) can answer those questions — though technically that’s a Gemini problem, not the watch's fault.\nThe other disappointment is a matter of proper integration. I was out on a walk and I asked for directions to a nearby grocery store. Gemini told me the address and the distance, but pointed me to look at my phone for the actual directions. When I asked Siri the same thing on the same walk, directions simply showed up on my Apple Watch. (Yes, I’ve been wearing two watches and carrying around two activated phones like a double agent, just much less cool.)\n\n\n\n  Tiles on the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic\n \n\n  Amy Skorheim for Engadget\n \n\nIn addition to Gemini, Wear OS 6 introduces updated and larger tiles which organize and display information on your watch. By default, the tiles are separated into categories: Health, Fitness and Basic (weather, media playback, calendar) with each box displaying a bit of pertinent info — activity metrics, current temp, your next event and so on. If the limited info isn’t enough, tapping a tile opens the respective app. You can categorize, rearrange, swap out and add as many pages of these cards as you want in the Wear app on your phone. I didn’t have time to get the defaults tweaked exactly how I wanted, but it already feels like a much smarter way of interacting with a watch. Now you can glean key information from the apps that are important to you just by browsing your tiles.\nThe running coach believes in you\nThe Galaxy Watch 8 now comes with built-in, AI-fueled running guidance. This sounds a bit like the upcoming Workout Buddy that Apple announced for watchOS 26, so it will be interesting to compare the two. Google Pixel watches and Fitbits currently have the option of an AI-powered running coach, but it’s limited to Premium subscribers. Garmin offers an adaptive training program called Run Coach as well, so this isn’t an entirely novel idea.\nSamsung’s running coach begins with an assessment: Run as fast as you can maintain for twelve minutes. You’ll then be awarded a performance level ranging from one to ten. Each level comes with a tailored, four-week plan with four workouts per week intended to get you ready to complete a 5K, 10K, half or full marathon. My 12-minute, 22-second per-mile pace put me at a level three. My plan was geared towards getting me to run a 5K at the end of four weeks.\n\n\n\n\n  Samsung/Engadget\n \n\nThe first workout was low-intensity interval running with four segments of running hard, interspersed with cool-down walks. As I ran, the AI coach told me when and what to expect on the next segment and what my goals were for each. It spouted occasional words of encouragement and let me know when my pace started to lag. The guidance wasn’t intrusive and I appreciated the preview of and expectations for the next segment. I tried it relying just on the watch's speakers, and I could hear OK as long as the streets were quiet, but I definitely recommend using earbuds.\nI found myself running faster than I would have without a “coach” and now I’m honestly wondering whether I, a person my athlete sister describes as “not an athlete,” could actually complete a 5K. Maybe there’s some value in this concept after all. In any case, I find myself looking forward to taking it further. My next workout is a straight up, 30-minute jog. I’ve never continuously run for a half an hour in my life, so we’ll see how that goes.\nVascular load, bedtime reminders and battery life\nThe quick turnaround on this article means I didn’t get to properly test some of the new features. Vascular load takes readings while you sleep to evaluate the health of your circulatory system, then tells you when your load is higher or lower than normal and offers recommendations. It requires three nights of data to set a baseline, but after the third night of wearing the watch to bed, it said I still needed one more. \nThree nights of sleep should also trigger a Bedtime Guidance feature, but I didn't see an notification letting me know the guidance had begun. After asking Samsung why, I was told I needed to turn it on in the Health app (Health > Sleep > tap three dots icon > Bedtime guidance). So I'll report back on the experience after using it for a few days.\nOne of the prior model’s shortcomings was battery life. The always-on display (AOD) tanked the charge, so I kept it off. The Galaxy Watch 8 has a bigger 325mAh battery, compared to the 300mAh one on the Watch 7. Twenty-five milliamp hours isn’t a huge jump, but bigger is always better. Because I was testing every possible feature (sleeping, running, workouts, antioxidants, Gemini and more), I was constantly dropping the watch on the charger for partial refills in between tests. That meant I didn’t have the opportunity to methodically test the battery’s runtime just yet.\nI did note what I could. The first day of testing, the battery was at 100 percent at 4PM. The next day at 4PM it still had 17 percent remaining. That 24-hour period included driving directions, three workouts, lots of Gemini requests, watch face changes and a full night of sleep. I’d toggled the AOD on and off throughout that time, but the results were still better than what I tracked on the Watch 7.\nThe Galaxy Watch 8 Classic is super swank\nI didn’t have a ton of time to spend with the Classic version of the Watch 8, but it’s obviously aimed at the luxury watch-hound crowd. The knurled spinning bezel, inset diving bezel replica and the default chronograph watch face gives off serious Rolex Daytona/Omega Speedmaster wannabe vibes. It ships with a stitched leather-look band and the steel case has the heft and stature of an automatic mechanical timepiece. The always-on display and chunky buttons only add to the effect.\n\n\n\n\n  Amy Skorheim for Engadget\n \n\nFor me, the main advantage it has over the standard Galaxy Watch 8 is the protection the spinning bezel offers the raised display. The glass is shielded at the edges and it’s even inset slightly which will ward off scratches. It’s a bit chonky for my taste, but it’s surprisingly comfortable for its size and is extremely attractive. I could see this appealing to style enthusiasts who want a smartwatch but don’t want to look like they’re wearing a wrist gadget.\nPricing and the competition\nSamsung added $50 to the price tag on the 40mm Galaxy Watch 8, bringing it to $350. The larger 44mm model is now $380 (versus $330 last year) and the Classic variant is $500 for the single 46mm size. For reference, there was no Galaxy Watch 7 Classic and the Galaxy Watch 6 Classic sold for $400 for the 43mm size and $430 for the 47mm.\nAt $350, the base model Galaxy Watch 8 costs the same as Google’s Pixel Watch 3 (though the Pixel Watch 4 is almost certainly on the way and could be more expensive.) The Apple Watch Series 10 starts at $399, but it went as low as $279 during Prime Day. And, of course, a new Apple wearable is likely coming this September with a potential price bump as well. So Samsung’s Galaxy Watch 8 could end up being the most affordable of the major smartwatch releases once the dust settles from 2025’s launches. And if you’re a Samsung smartphone user, it’s easily your best bet.\n\n\n\n\n  Amy Skorheim for Engadget\n \n\nEverything else and an eventual score\nThe core functions of the Galaxy Watch 8 haven’t changed all that much. We went in-depth on the fitness and health features for our review of the Galaxy Watch 6 and covered the notable perks of Samsung’s wearable in our Galaxy Watch 7 review and our Galaxy Watch 5 review. So I’ll just point out that the workout tracking is still accurate — and it’s faster to suss out when I’m on a walk than my Apple Watch. The companion Health app, where you view all the data your watch gathers, is helpful and a delight to use with its common-sense suggestions and friendly animations. And the daily Energy Score is a useful indicator of how I’m doing with my sleep and movement goals.\nThe Watch 8 covers the basics well, acting as an industrious accessory for a Galaxy phone. Although, as with the Watch 7, I wish the notifications were more intrusive as they’re easy to miss. The double tap feature is great — a pinch gesture that dismisses or triggers actions without you having to touch the screen. I use it often and the watch almost always registers the motion. And finally, I love how customizable the watch faces are. When you combine all that with a substantially refreshed look, some capable Gemini integration, a few new health features and a more navigable interface, Samsung’s latest wearable becomes a very capable wrist companion. I still need to live with it a while longer (with a new screen protector firmly in place) to assign a review score, but so far, I’m impressed.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wearables/galaxy-watch-8-my-first-days-with-samsungs-smartwatch-have-been-promising-155857718.html?src=rss",
    "full_text": "That means I’ve been living with the Galaxy Watch 8 for four days now. Considering South Korea is one of the world’s largest persimmon producers, it might make sense that a Samsung device suggested them. This time around, the Galaxy Watch 8 looks markedly different thanks to a shape borrowed from last year’s Ultra model. That’s possibly because I was cheap and ordered off-brand screen protectors, or perhaps the protruding glass cushion is simply begging for misfortune. In fact, on-screen cues suggest that gesture when there’s more content to view. Google’s AI was pretty snappy at basic tasks like setting reminders and timers. I asked for the best record stores in my city and a good place to eat lunch. Google Pixel watches and Fitbits currently have the option of an AI-powered running coach, but it’s limited to Premium subscribers.

    "summary": "Eliza McNitt is no stranger to new media. Her 2017 project, Fistful of Stars, was a fascinating look at stellar birth in virtual reality, while her follow-up Spheres explored black holes and the death of stars. Now with her short film Ancestra, McNitt has tapped into Google's AI tools to tell a deeply personal story. Working with Google Deepmind and director Darren Aronofsky's studio Primordial Soup, McNitt used a combination of live-action footage and AI-generated media to tell the story of her own traumatic birth.\nThe result is an uncanny dramatic short where the genuine emotion of the live-action performance wrestles agains the artificiality of AI imagery. The film begins when the lead's (Audrey Corsa, playing McNitt's mother) routine natal care appointment turns into an emergency delivery. From that point on we hear her opine on how her child and all living things in the universe are connected — evoking the poetic nature of Terrence Malick's films. We jump between Corsa's performance, AI footage and macro- and micro-photography. In the end, Corsa holds a baby that was inserted by Google's AI, using prompts that make it look like McNitt as an infant.\n\nThere's no escaping the looming shadow of Google's AI ambitions. This isn't just an art film — it's an attempt at legitimizing the use of AI tools through McNitt's voice. That remains a problem when Google's models, including Veo and other technology from DeepMind, have been trained on pre-existing content and copyrighted works. A prestigious short coming from Darren Aronofsky's production studio isn't enough to erase that original sin.\n\"I was challenged to create an idea that could incorporate AI,\" McNitt said in an interview on the Engadget Podcast. \"And so for me, I wanted to tell a really deeply personal story in a way that I had not been able to before... AI really offered this opportunity to access these worlds where a camera cannot go, from the cosmos to the inner world of being within the mother's womb.\"\n\nWhen it comes to justifying the use of AI tools, which at the moment can credibly be described as plagiaristic technology, McNitt says that's a decision every artist will have to make for themselves. In the case of Ancestra, she wanted to use AI to accomplish difficult work, like creating a computer generated infant that looked like her, based on photos taken by her father. She found that to be more ethical than bringing in a real newborn, and the results more convincing than a doll or something animated by a CG artist.\n\"I felt the use of AI was really important for this story, and I think it's up to every artist to decide how they wanna use these tools and define that,\" she said. \"That was something else for me in this project where I had to define a really strong boundary where I did not want actors to be AI actors, [they] had to be humans with a soul. I do not feel that an performance can be recreated by a machine. I do deeply and strongly believe that  humanity can only be captured through human beings. And so I do think it's really important to have humans at the center of the stories.\"\nTo that end, McNitt also worked with dozens of artists create the sound, imagery and AI media in Ancestra. There's a worry that AI video tools will let anyone plug in a few prompts and build projects out of low-effort footage, but McNitt says she closely collaborated with a team of DeepMind engineers who crafted prompts and sifted through the results to find the footage she was looking for. (We ran out of time before I could ask her about the environmental concerns from using generative AI, but at this point we know it requires a significant amount of electricity and water. That includes demands for training models as well as running them in cloud.)\n\n\"I do think, as [generative AI] evolves, it's the responsibility of companies to not be taking copyrighted materials and to respect artists and to set those boundaries, so that artists don't get taken advantage of,\" McNitt said, when asked about her thoughts on future AI models that compensate artists and aren't built on stolen copyrighted works. \"I think that that's a really important part of our role as humans going forward. Because ultimately, These are human stories for other human beings. And so it's, you know, important that we are at the center of that.\"This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/engadget-podcast-ancestra-director-eliza-mcnitt-defends-ai-as-a-creative-tool-150042942.html?src=rss",

A risk-based regulation for applications of artificial intelligence, the AI Act bans some “unacceptable risk” use cases outright, such as cognitive behavioral manipulation or social scoring. But the Commission has held firm, saying it will not change its timeline. Also on Friday, the EU published guidelines for providers of AI models ahead of rules that will go into effect on August 2. Companies that have such models on the market before August 2 will have to comply with the legislation by August 2, 2027."

    "summary": "If you're on the market for a new pair of AirPods, you're in luck. The latest AirPods 4 are down to some of the best prices we've seen. You can pick up the standard AirPods 4 for $90, a 30-percent discount, or the AirPods 4 with ANC for $120, a 33 percent discount.\nWhile neither deal is quite as good as the ones we saw during the Prime day sale that just passed, you’re only going to be an extra dollar down regardless of which model you go for. The non-ANC AirPods 4 were $89 for Prime Day (a record low), while the noise-cancelling buds could be snagged for $119. If you missed out then, these deals are virtually the same. \n\n\nYou really can’t go wrong with the AirPods 4. While the AirPods Pro 2 remain our number one pick for the entire product category, we think the former are the best choice if you’re on a budget. Apple’s “regular” earbuds were given a long overdue spruce-up in 2024, offering the option of ANC on the non-Pro AirPods for the first time, as well as an improved design and better sound quality.\nWhether you go for the ANC or entry level model, you’ll benefit from the various features afforded by the H2 audio chip. These include Voice Isolation, Personalized Spatial Audio with dynamic head tracking, Personalized Volume and Adaptive EQ. The AirPods 4 with ANC add Conversation Awareness, Adaptive Audio and a Transparency mode to the spec sheet.\nDownsides? You still can’t change the volume using onboard controls, and the cheaper AirPods 4 don’t come with a case that supports wireless charging via MagSage or Qi, which is a disappointment. The AirPods Pro 4 with ANC do a pretty good job of banishing low-frequency background noise, but the noise-canceling capabilities aren't quite as strong as what you get with the AirPods Pro 2.\nCheck out our coverage of the best Apple deals for more discounts, and follow @EngadgetDeals on X for the latest tech deals and buying advice.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/apples-airpods-4-are-up-to-33-percent-off-right-now-141631725.html?src=rss",

They can sign up individually or in groups of up to four people, whose data will be partially shared between each other.

Their mission was to take their knowledge of designing and building some of the world’s fastest cars to build a better e-scooter. But while they no longer work for a Formula One team, they can’t quite shake that desire to build vehicles that travel at preposterously daft speed. Which is why the company has today unveiled The Turbo, a souped-up version of the standard Bo e-scooter with a potential top speed of more than 100 miles per hour and a range of up to 150 miles.\nBo Mobility\nThe Turbo (surely, the Tur…Bo, non?) is equipped with a 24,000W dual-motor engine, and a 1,800Wh battery. Naturally, given Bo’s focus on safety and balance, the scooter has F1-style air intakes to keep both the electronics and brakes nicely cool. Given the scooter’s light weight, Bo claims it has a higher power to weight ratio than a hypercar like the Bugatti Veyron. It’s already been tested by former professional BMX rider Tre Whyte. Although he hasn’t quite yet been able to breach the 100mph barrier the company thinks that isn’t far off.\nOf course, the Turbo is one way to pull the world’s eyeballs to a product, especially as it’s announcing the US availability of its scooters. Customers in the US can now order a Bo M, with vehicles available at some point in August 2025. If you want the standard Bo M, with a range of 25 miles, will set you back $1,990 while the M2, with a range pushing 40 miles, will cost $2,490. And, if you’re the sort of person who thinks that owning a scooter that can go at road car speeds is a good idea, you’ll actually be able to buy a Turbo: It’ll cost you at least $29,500, with the first delivery going to a collector in Madrid next year ahead of that city's inaugural grand prix.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/this-is-the-daftest-e-scooter-in-the-world-131341641.html?src=rss",

    "full_text": "Companies developing video AI models and tools often talk about working with Hollywood studios to make certain workflows possible. On Thursday, Netflix said that it has started using AI in movies and shows it produces. Speaking at the company’s post-results conference call, co-CEO Ted Sarandos said that the platform had “the very first GenAI final footage to appear on screen” in an Argentine show called “El Eternauta” (“The Eternaut”). He noted that Netflix’s internal production group teamed up with producers to use AI to create a scene of a building collapsing. Sarandos said that using AI, the scene was finished 10x faster than it would have with traditional visual effect tools, and that it cost less. “We remain convinced that AI represents an incredible opportunity to help creators make films and series better, not just cheaper. Our creators are already seeing the benefits in production through pre-visualization and shot-planning work, and certainly visual effects. It used to be that only big-budget projects would have access to advanced visual effects like de-aging,” he said during the call. Co-CEO Greg Peters said Netflix is using generative AI in other areas as well, including personalization and search and ads, and the company aims to roll out interactive ads in the second half of this year. Earlier this year, the company introduced AI-powered search."

US District Judge Loren AliKhan has just ruled that her removal from the agency was \"unlawful and without legal effect\" and that she was still a \"rightful member\" of the commission. The judge explained that the firings violated protections that prevent a president from unilaterally removing officials at independent agencies. \nIn her statement after the ruling was handed down, Slaughter said the \"for-cause removal protections that apply to [her] colleagues and her at the FTC also protect other independent economic regulators like the SEC, the FDIC, and the Federal Reserve.\" Slaughter was one of the two Democratic members of the Federal Trade Commission that Trump had removed from their position, leaving only three Republican commissioners in charge. \nHistorically, the FTC had five members: Three from the same party as the president and two from the opposite party. At the moment, FTC's website only lists the three current Republican commissioners, including Chairman Andrew Ferguson. The chairman previously said that he had \"no doubts about [Trump's] constitutional authority to remove Commissioners, which is necessary to ensure democratic accountability for [the] government.\" The other fired Democratic commissioner, Alvaro Bedoya, was originally part of the lawsuit. However, his claims had been dismissed since he resigned from the agency completely and took on a private-sector job since then, explaining that he couldn't afford to have no income while the case was in court. \nWhite House spokesperson Kush Desai told The New York Times that the administration would appeal AliKhan's decision. \"The Supreme Court has repeatedly upheld the president’s constitutional authority to fire and remove executive officers who exercise his authority,” he added. The judge expected as such and noted in her ruling that the case would likely reach the Supreme Court.

    "full_text": "Some ChatGPT users have noticed a new feature called “Study Together” appearing in their list of available tools. OpenAI has started using Google’s AI chips to power ChatGPT and other products, as reported by Reuters. Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, said during a recent AI event hosted by VC firm Sequoia that he wants ChatGPT to record and remember every detail of a person’s life when one attendee asked about how ChatGPT can become more personalized. It will help organizations in Asia meet their local data sovereignty requirements when using OpenAI’s products. OpenAI said on Tuesday that it might revise its safety standards if “another frontier AI developer releases a high-risk system without comparable safeguards.” The move shows how commercial AI developers face more pressure to rapidly implement models due to the increased competition. OpenAI wants to incorporate Anthropic’s Model Context Protocol (MCP) into all of its products, including the ChatGPT desktop app. Reliance has proposed selling OpenAI’s models to businesses in India through an application programming interface (API) so they can incorporate AI into their operations. we trained a new model that is good at creative writing (not sure yet how/when it will get released). It’s unclear when these agentic tools might launch or which customers will be eligible to buy them. OpenAI says the “agent” is intended for instances where you don’t just want a quick answer or summary, but instead need to assiduously consider information from multiple websites and other sources."

    "summary": "Whether you're working in a noisy office, commuting on a packed train or just trying to focus at home, a good pair of noise-canceling headphones can make all the difference. The best noise-canceling headphones block out distractions and let you enjoy your music, podcasts or calls in peace — all while delivering great sound quality and all-day comfort. From models with plush cushions to wireless cans with loads of extra features, there’s something here for every style and budget.\nTable of contents\n\nBest noise-canceling headphones for 2025\nHow to choose the best noise-canceling headphones for you\nHow we test noise-canceling headphones\nOther noise-canceling headphones we tested\nNoise-canceling headphones FAQs\n\nBest noise-canceling headphones of 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to choose the best noise-canceling headphones for you\nDesign\nWhen you’re shopping for the best wireless headphones, the first thing you’ll need to decide on is wear style. Do you prefer on-ear or over-ear headphones? For the purposes of this guide, I focus on the over-ear style as that’s what most noise-canceling headphones are nowadays. Sure, you can find on-ear models with ANC, but over-ear, active noise-canceling headphones are much more effective at blocking outside sounds since your ears are completely covered. \nFor gamers, there are also gaming headsets that feature noise cancellation — some even have detachable microphones, so they can double as over-ear headphones. However, for the purpose of this article, we’re only going to be focusing on noise-canceling headphones rather than headsets. Look for models with a comfortable headband and memory foam ear cups to ensure you can wear them for long periods without discomfort.\nMany headphones also come with a range of color options, so if aesthetics matter to you, you’ll find plenty of choices beyond just black or white. Whether you’re looking for something neutral or a bold pop of color, brands now offer a variety of styles to match your personal taste.\nFinally, if you’re planning to wear your headphones for long periods of time, it’s important to pick a model with a comfortable fit. Memory foam ear cups, an adjustable headband, and lightweight materials can make all the difference during extended listening sessions. After all, great sound is only part of the equation; comfort matters just as much.\nType of noise cancellation\nNext, you’ll want to look at the type of ANC a set of headphones offers. You’ll come across terms like “hybrid active noise cancellation” or “hybrid adaptive active noise cancellation,” and there are key differences between the two. A hybrid ANC setup uses microphones on the inside and on the outside of the device to detect outside noise and cancel it out. By analyzing input from both mics, a hybrid system can combat more sounds than “regular” ANC, but it does so at a constant level that doesn’t change.\nAdaptive ANC takes the hybrid configuration a step further by continuously adjusting the noise cancellation for changes in your environment and any leakage around the padding of the ear cups. Adaptive noise-canceling also does a better job with wind noise, which can really kill your vibe while using headphones outdoors. Some high-end headphones also support Dolby Atmos, which enhances spatial audio and makes everything from music to movies sound more immersive. For the purposes of this best headphones list, I’m only considering products with hybrid ANC or adaptive ANC setups because those are the most effective at blocking noise and improving your overall listening experience.\nCustomization\nYou’ll also want to check to see if the ANC system on a prospective set of headphones offers adjustable levels of noise cancellation or presets. These can help you dial in the amount of ANC you need for various environments, but it can also help you save battery life. Master & Dynamic, for example, has ANC presets that provide both maximum noise blocking and more efficient cancellation that is more energy efficient. Other companies may include a slider in their companion apps that let you adjust the ANC level to your liking. Some high-end models even allow you to fine-tune the ANC for specific types of environments.\nHow we test noise-canceling headphones\nThe primary way we test headphones is to wear them as much as possible. I prefer to do this over a one-to-two-week period, but sometimes deadlines don’t allow it. During this time, I listen to a mix of music and podcasts, while also using the headphones to take both voice and video calls.\nSince battery life for headphones can be 30 hours or more, I drain the battery with looping music and the volume set at a comfortable level (usually around 75 percent). Due to the longer battery estimates, I’ll typically power the headphones off several times and leave them that way during a review. This simulates real-world use and keeps me from having to constantly monitor the process for over 24 straight hours.\nTo test ANC performance specifically, I use headphones in a variety of environments, from noisy coffee shops to quiet home offices. When my schedule allows, I use them during air travel since plane noise is a massive distraction to both work and relaxation. Even if I can’t hop on a flight, I’ll simulate a constant roar with white noise machines, bathroom fans, vacuums and more. I also make note of how well each device blocks human voices, which are a key stumbling block for a lot of ANC headphones.\nANC-related features are something else to consider. Here, I do a thorough review of companion apps, testing each feature as I work through the software. Any holdovers from previous models are double checked for improvements or regression. If the headphones I’m testing are an updated version of a previous model, I’ll spend time getting reacquainted with the older set. Ditto for the closest competition for each new set of headphones that I review.\nOther noise-canceling headphones we tested\nAirPods Max\nApple’s AirPods Max are premium, well-designed headphones that incorporate all of the best features you find on standard AirPods: solid noise cancelation, spatial audio and easy Siri access. However, their $550 starting price makes them almost prohibitively expensive, even for those with Apple devices. There are better options available at lower prices.\nSonos Ace\nThe Sonos Ace is an excellent debut for the company’s first headphones. The combination of refined design, great sound quality and home theater tricks creates a unique formula. However, ANC performance is just okay and key functionality is still in the works for many users.\nBeats Studio Pro\nThe Studio Pro lacks basic features like automatic pausing, and multipoint connectivity is only available on Android. Moreover, they’re not very comfortable for people with larger heads. Overall sound quality is improved, though, and voice performance on calls is well above average.\nNoise-canceling headphones FAQs\nDoes noise cancellation block all noise?\nNoise cancellation doesn’t block out all noise, though it does drastically reduce the volume of most external sounds.\nIs there a difference between wired vs wireless noise-canceling headphones?\nIn terms of sound quality, if you have two headphones — one wired and one wireless — with similar specs, the difference is going to be very minimal. However, wireless headphones offer more convenience, allowing you to move around more freely with your headphones on, which is why they often feature noise cancellation to minimize external sounds.\nDoes noise cancellation impact sound quality?\nANC does bear some weight on sound quality, but the impact of this often doesn’t outweigh the benefits. Noise cancellation reduces ambient noise, allowing a greater focus on audio detail. For audiophiles, however, there may be a small difference in sound fidelity when ANC is turned on.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/best-noise-canceling-headphones-130029881.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Foldable phones have gone from futuristic novelties to genuinely useful devices that blend portability with big-screen versatility. Whether you're into multitasking, mobile gaming or just love having a phone that turns heads, the best foldable phones you can buy offer powerful performance, durable designs and impressive displays that unfold to reveal more room for apps, videos and productivity.From book-style designs to flip-style clamshells, the best foldable phone for you depends on how you like to use your device. Some models focus on flagship-level power and multitasking features, while others aim to keep things compact and stylish. Either way, these folding handsets are pushing the boundaries of what smartphones can do.Note: For this guide, we’re focusing on devices that are widely available in North America and Europe. That’s because while there are even more options for people who live in Asia (especially China), they are often difficult to buy from abroad and may not support your local carriers.\nTable of contents\n\nBest foldable phones for 2025\nHow we test foldable phones\nAre foldable phones worth it? A note on durability\nFoldable phone FAQs\n\nBest foldable phones for 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow we test foldable phones\nWhen evaluating new foldable phones, we consider the same general criteria as we do when we’re judging the best smartphones. Devices need to have good battery life (at least a full day’s use), bright inner displays (peaks of at least 1,000 nits), sharp cameras and responsive performance. That said, foldable phones come in different shapes (and sizes); there are varying designs that may appeal to different types of people. \nFor those who prefer more compact and stylish devices, flip phone-style foldables resemble old-school namesakes but with flexible interior displays (typically six to seven inches diagonally) and smaller outer screens, often referred to as the cover display. Alternatively, for power users and people who want to maximize mobile productivity, there are larger book-style foldables (with seven to eight-inch main displays) that can transform from a candy bar-style phone to essentially a small tablet when opened.\nAre foldable phones worth it? A note on durability\nAside from their displays, the biggest difference between foldable phones and more traditional handsets is durability. That’s because while some models like the Pixel 9 Pro Fold and Samsung’s foldables offer IPX8 water resistance (which is good for submersions of up to five feet for 30 minutes), their flexible screens – which are largely made from plastic – present some unique challenges.\nMost foldables come with factory-installed screen protectors. However, unlike regular phones, users are instructed not to remove them without assistance from approved service centers. Thankfully, Samsung phones do offer one free screen protector replacement for its foldables, while Google charges between $29 and $129 depending on the warranty status of your device. That said, while we can’t do long-term testing for every new foldable phone on the market, after personally using the Galaxy Z Fold 3 and Galaxy Z Fold 4 each for a year, I’ve found that Samsung’s pre-installed screen protector tends to start bubbling nine to 12 months after purchase. So you’ll probably want to factor in that your foldable may need some sort of servicing after about a year unless you plan on removing the screen protector entirely (which is possible, but goes against most manufacturers' instructions).\nFurthermore, foldable phone owners need to be mindful about keeping sharp objects away from their flexible displays, as rocks, keys or even pressing down very hard with a fingernail can leave permanent marks. In the event that you need to get a flexible screen serviced, you’re potentially facing a much higher repair bill when compared to a typical phone (up to $500 or more depending on the model and the severity of the damage). In short, while the ruggedness of foldable phones has improved a lot, they're still more delicate than traditional handsets, which is something you need to account for.\nHowever, foldables continue to evolve, with better AI features, improved specs and a more refined form factors that makes them even more practical. Whether you’re after a flip phone for nostalgia or a big screen device for multitasking, today’s foldable phones offer exciting possibilities — you just have to decide if they’re the right fit for you.\nFoldable phone FAQs\nWhat is the difference between a foldable phone and a flip phone?\nFoldable and flip phones both use flexible displays, but the way they fold — and what that means for usability — is different. A foldable phone typically opens like a book, giving you a larger tablet-like screen inside, which is great for multitasking or media. A flip phone, on the other hand, folds vertically to become more compact, kind of like the classic clamshell phones of the early 2000s. Flip phones are more pocket-friendly, while foldables offer more screen real estate when open.\nWhat is the disadvantage of a foldable phone?\nThe biggest trade-offs with foldable phones are price and durability. They're often more expensive than traditional smartphones, thanks to the complex hinge mechanisms and flexible displays. Battery life can sometimes take a hit too, especially with larger screens. And while the tech has come a long way, foldables can still be a bit bulkier and not quite as seamless as regular slab phones when it comes to everyday use.\nAre foldable phones less durable than other phones?\nGenerally, yes — at least for now. Foldable phones use flexible displays and intricate hinges, which can be more prone to wear and tear over time compared to standard phones with solid glass screens. That said, newer models have gotten tougher with improved hinge designs, water resistance and stronger ultra-thin glass. They're definitely more durable than they used to be, but they still require a bit more care than your average smartphone.\nGeorgie Peru contributed to this report.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/best-foldable-phones-160030013.html?src=rss",

Samsung says this is its brightest foldable display yet, making it easier to use and read outdoors. It’s available in three colors, with the magenta model featuring a soft vegan leather back. Starting at £800 (U.S. pricing still TBA), it’s one of the least expensive options on sale today.

The manufacturing park will be built as part of its planned walkable city with over 175,000 homes, CEO Jan Sramek said at the Reindustrialize conference in Detroit. Sramek tweeted that U.S. manufacturers can’t win by “building factories off of random freeway exits in the middle of nowhere. The best people don’t want to work there.” This site will offer expedited permitting, transportation for finished goods, and plenty of power from renewable energy, he said.

While the company hasn't been trying to be a YouTube competitor for a while, TV apps were always more convenient than Vimeo's proposed solution of casting video from a smartphone or tablet.

    "summary": "Apple announces the new additions to its smartphone lineup in the fall, and the iPhone 17 is the upcoming collection. We learned a lot about what to expect on the software side during the company's WWDC presentation, but there have also been several leaks and rumors about the hardware side ahead of the phones' official introduction. Here's what we know and what we're expecting from Cupertino this autumn.\nWhen will the iPhone 17 series be announced?\nMost years, the flagship smartphones are introduced in September. It's a little early to have the specific dates; some years, Apple only gives a week or two of lead time between sending invites and hosting the event. But years of past precedent show that sometime in September should be when the 17 models make their debut. This family of smartphones may be the last to follow that trend, however. There have been hints that the introduction of the iPhone 18 collection in 2026 will be split into a pro-tier announcement in the fall and a standard model announcement the following spring.\nWhat will the new iPhone 17 lineup include?\nDesign leaks suggest that Apple is building an ultra-thin smartphone, likely to be named the iPhone 17 Air to match Apple's ultralight laptop designation. Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, often a solid source of advanced intel about Apple, reported in January that the iPhone 17 Air will be equipped with a basic A19 chip and will only have a single camera lens. It may also use Apple's new in-house modem, which was introduced in February on the iPhone 16e. More details about this development may leak ahead of September, but that's what we know for now.\nAn investor note from Apple analyst Jeff Pu indicated that the Air will have a titanium frame. If his reports are accurate, the lightweight smartphone will be the only entry in the iPhone 17 lineup to use that metal; the iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone 17 Pro Max are expected to be made of aluminum, which is oddly a lighter material than titanium. Other speculation had suggested that the Air would use a blend of aluminum and titanium, so the exact materials may not be known until the official announcement.\nEach new roster includes a base model, but over the years, Apple shakes up the variety of phones it offers. Most likely there will be an iPhone 17 and an iPhone 17 Pro. Apple has also committed to the size matters philosophy, and has been building an iPhone Pro Max option with an even bigger screen and better battery life; the 17 roster will almost certainly have one as well. \nThe iPhone 17 Air seems primed to take the place of a potential iPhone 17 Plus. Since the iPhone 16e was only just introduced in February at a surprisingly high price point, it seems unlikely that there will be a new addition to that lower end of the spectrum, the models that were previously called SE. \nAt the very least, it sounds like the iPhone 17 Air won't take away the charging port and rely only on wireless connectivity. Bloomberg said that while Apple had investigated making the iPhone 17 Air without a single port, the company (fortunately) changed plans. He also says that the rumored phone will have a 6.6-inch screen and include the Dynamic Island and Camera Control button. Finally, the price is rumored at $900 — likely more than the standard iPhone 17 but less than the Pro.\nWe've also gotten what seems to be a reliable look at what the color lineup will be for the new smartphones. Macworld reported that the iPhone 17 will be available in black, white, steel gray, green, purple and light blue. The iPhone 17 Air will reportedly have four color options: black, white, light blue and light gold. While the Air colors will be less saturated, the visuals for the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max will go bold. The options for the Pro models are expected to be black, white, gray, dark blue and orange.\nWhat will iOS 26 be like?\nApple upended its numbering conventions with WWDC 2025, and will match the name of each new operating system to the year it's released. So when the next wave of iPhones hits, they'll be running on iOS 26.\nOn the design side, the smartphone OS introduced during the big developer showcase took a contentious approach dubbed Liquid Glass. Apple has been scaling down the amount of transparency effects in the subsequent beta tests of iOS 26, but it will still have a glass-like visual.\nThe feature list includes big and small updates. On the more impactful side, the Phone and Photos apps have been redesigned. There will be several features leveraging artificial intelligence, such as live translation capabilities coming to Phone, FaceTime and Messages. Apple is also currently testing a sensitive content warning for child accounts that will freeze FaceTime video if nudity is detected by on-device machine learning tools. And the company is also launching Visual Intelligence, which will use AI to search for elements in an image.\niOS 26 also has a litany of minor, quality of life improvements. Group texts are getting support for polls. And for the slow risers out there, iOS 26 will finally let you escape the tyranny of the nine minute snooze alarm. Here's a rundown of everything we've heard about iOS 26 so far and which smartphones, aside from the upcoming 17 collection, will support it.\nUpdate, July 17, 2025, 4:40PM ET: Added latest information about iOS 26, possible materials for the Air, and the color options for the different models.\nUpdate, March 17, 2025, 2PM ET: Added details about the rumored price and features of the iPhone 17 Air.\nUpdate, April 11, 2025, 3:45PM ET: Added details from Front Page Tech's new video that claims to reveal details from a leaked iOS 19 build.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/iphone-17-pro-max-and-air-everything-we-know-about-apples-new-phones-153024282.html?src=rss",

The streaming service's two existing tiers will cost an additional $3 per month, and Peacock will also start testing  a cheaper $7.99 \"Select\" tier that includes access to NBC and Bravo shows and a limited number of titles from the NBCUniversal back catalog.\nWith the new price hike, Peacock's ad-supported \"Premium\" plan will go from costing $8 per month to $11 per month, and the \"Premium Plus\" plan, which features fewer ads, will go from costing $14 per month to $17 per month. The discounted annual subscription for the Premium plan is now $110 per year, while the Premium Plus plan is $170 per year. The updated subscription fees will go into affect for new and returning customers on July 23, and on August 22 for current customers.\nWhile these fees are still on the low end of the $25-per-month that Netflix charges for its most premium tier, this is the third time Peacock has raised prices in the last three years. The streaming service's cheapest plan went from $5 to $6 per month in 2023, and then from $6 to $8 per month in 2024. At this rate Peacock subscriptions will cost an additional $4 in 2026.\nPeacock hasn't achieved the same level of critical acclaim as competitors like HBO Max or Netflix, but the timing of its price hike does follow a recent hot streak. The most recent season of Love Island USA, which streams exclusively on Peacock, was hugely popular. Nielsen rated the show as \"the No. 1 most-watched streaming reality series\" multiple weeks in a row in June, according to NBCUniversal, and the show became Peacock's \"most-watched entertainment series on mobile devices, with nearly 30 percent of viewership happening on phones and tablets.\"\nTesting out the new Peacock Select plan seems like a further attempt to capitalize on that reality TV-focused audience.

    "full_text": "Microsoft is building data centers as fast as it can, and that’s killing its carbon balance sheet. Since 2020, its carbon emissions have grown by nearly a quarter, undermining the pledge it made that year to remove more carbon from the atmosphere than it generates by 2030. So Microsoft has been buying massive amounts of carbon-removal credits to attempt to remedy that situation, including a newly announced purchase of 4.9 million metric tons from Vaulted Deep. It will last 12 years through 2038. Vaulted Deep operates like a reverse oil company. It collects solid waste — like treated sewage, excess manure, or paper sludge — that would otherwise be headed for a landfill or incinerator, blends it into a slurry, and injects it into porous rocks deep underground. So far, Vaulted Deep has removed over 18,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide. Recently, Microsoft has been stuck between a rock and a hard place to make good on its imperiled carbon pledge. While the tech company has been investing heavily in renewable power — avoiding emissions is considered the appropriate first step — there are some things it must use, like semiconductors, for which there are no zero-greenhouse-gas alternatives. Among them are a 7 million metric ton deal with Chestnut Carbon to reforest 60,000 acres in the southeastern U.S. and another for 3.7 million metric tons with CO280 to capture carbon from paper mill operations along the Gulf Coast."

This comes after a teaser dropped a few months back and over two years after the film was first announced.\nThe new footage is pretty cool, and gets into the meat of this threequel. It's a riff on AI and big tech, as corporate entities look to weaponize the digital creations of The Grid and bring them to the real world. This does not go well, as evidenced by shots of iconic franchise Recognizer ships careening down city streets.\n\nIt also features Jeff Bridges, returning as computer programmer Kevin Flynn. Bridges is the only actor who will have appeared in all three Tron films. The star of this new one, however, is the scandal-plagued Jared Leto, who plays a soldier from The Grid who has traveled to the real world on some kind of mission. Hasan Minhaj, Gillian Anderson, Greta Lee and Evan Peters are also in the movie.\nTron: Ares is directed by Joachim Rønning, who is something of a Disney hired gun. He made Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales and Maleficent: Mistress of Evil, among other films for the company.\nI really have no idea what to make of this movie, even if the footage looks pretty nifty. I love the original and like the sequel well enough. One thing I'm happy about is the continued dedication to atmosphere-soaked soundtracks. The first film featured an iconic score by Wendy Carlos and the folks behind Tron: Legacy hired Daft Punk to make the music. The new movie includes a soundtrack by Nine Inch Nails.

    "summary": "After five years of development, one of Steam's coziest games is leaving Steam early access and making the jump to consoles. Starting today, you can purchase The Wandering Village on PC, Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 5. On Steam, the game's developer, Stray Fawn Studio, is offering a 35 percent discount until July 31. In the US, that means you can get the game for just under $20. Switch owners, meanwhile, can get a 10 percent launch discount until August 7.\n\nI've been playing The Wandering Village on and off since it entered early access in 2022. It's a lovely game that combines two very different influences. Most obviously, the game wears on its sleeve Stray Fawn's love of Hayao Miyazaki's seminal Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind. The manga and later film is set in a desolate, post-apocalyptic world ravaged by nuclear war. \nThe Wandering Village's other major influence are the titles of Impressions Games. In the late '90s and early 2000s, the now-defunct studio went on a hot streak  releasing three games — Caesar III, Pharaoh and Zeus: Master of Olympus — that, to this day, define much of the city-building genre.\nThe Wandering Village marries those influences in a novel way. Rather than building your city on solid ground, you build it on the back of a giant creature called the Onbu. As you can probably guess, the Onbu doesn't stay still. And while there are ways you can influence its behavior, sometimes it can have a mind of its own. All of that leads to some interesting gameplay interactions. For example, the Onbu might wander into a biome that is toxic to your villagers. As of the writing of this article, the game has a \"very positive\" rating on Steam on nearly 6,000 reviews, with recent reviews tilting toward \"overwhelming positive.\"\nIf you want to grab a physical copy of the game for Switch or PS5, Stray Fawn has partnered with Serenity Forge to offer collectors and premium editions of the game. Pre-orders will ship early next year. Despite the game leaving early access, Stray Fawn has promised to keep working The Wandering Village. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/one-of-my-favorite-steam-early-access-games-is-now-available-on-switch-and-ps5-174539016.html?src=rss",

Its most recent sustainability report concedes its overall carbon emissions grew for the first time since 2022. It reported a six percent increase in its carbon footprint across 2024, laying much of the blame at the feet of its data center rollout.\nThe reported increase is significant given Amazon’s method of reporting its own environmental impact.

In 2022, Amazon revised its climate reporting methodology which also led to the company’s figures falling dramatically.\nIn addition, the company reported an increase in emissions tied to the purchase of power from outside sources. “The increased energy demand is from AI chips,” says the report, which “require more electricity and cooling than traditional chips.” As well as the power to run and cool those chips, Amazon is building big to increase its server capacity. Data center construction, as well as fuel use by logistics contractors, led indirect emissions to increase by six percent. That said, the company’s own fossil fuel emissions increased by seven percent in 2024, which is hardly a ringing endorsement.\nAmazon is a co-founder of The Climate Pledge, an initiative to reach net zero emissions by 2040.

    "summary": "You might already have a good idea of which smartphone you want to be your next one. But there are more solid options available now than ever before, making the decision not as cut-and-dry as it used to be. While the decision is a bit easier if you know you want an iPhone, there's even enough variation between those new models that you may have to think about it longer than you anticipated. If you’re an Android person, you have even more options to choose from — including foldables — and more questions to answer before you spend any money.At Engadget, we review phones regularly and have tested dozens over the years. Whether you’ve had your eye on one of our current top picks, one of Samsung's Galaxy S25 phones, a cheap phone or another device, we’re here to help you decide which is the best phone to buy this year.\nAndroid or iOS?\nWhen you're searching for the best smartphone, it becomes clear that each OS has its pros and cons. Apple’s tight-knit ecosystem makes it super easy to share data between iPhones, iPads and Macs or seamlessly hand-off phone calls or music from one device to another. At the same time, you’re effectively locked in, as services like Apple Messages aren’t available on other platforms. \nAs for Android, there’s a much wider range of handsets from companies like Google, Samsung, Sony and more. However, Android phones don’t enjoy that same length of software support and often have lower trade-in values. In short, there’s no wrong answer. However, you will want to consider how your phone will fit in with the rest of your devices. So unless you’re really fed up with one OS and willing to learn another, it probably doesn’t make a lot of sense to switch from an iPhone to an Android phone (or vice versa) – especially if everyone else in your household is using the same platform.\nCameras\nSince your cell phone often pulls double duty as your primary camera, figuring out what kind of photo tools you want is key. Nowadays, practically every mobile phone can take a great picture in bright light. But if you want a long optical zoom, you’ll probably have to upgrade to a more expensive device.\n\n\n\n\n  Cherlynn Low / Engadget\n \n\nMid-range phones often only have two rear cameras (a primary wide-angle lens and a secondary ultra-wide camera) and can sometimes struggle in low-light situations. Each phone maker also has various features that might be a better fit for your style, with Apple offering four different color presets on the latest iPhones, while Google’s Pixel 9 Pro comes with neat tools like dedicated long exposure and Action Pan modes.\nWill you get mmWave 5G or Wi-Fi 7?\nThe good news is that in 2025, most phones have at least Wi-Fi 6 or Wi-Fi 6e and support for some kind of 5G connectivity. However, if you want the fastest wireless speeds possible, it’s going to cost you a little extra. For example, on certain networks, mmWave 5G offers up to gigabit download speeds, less latency and better bandwidth. But mmWave 5G also requires more sophisticated (and pricier) modems, which means support for it is often missing on less expensive devices.\nOn the bright side, mmWave 5G isn’t as widely available as other versions of 5G, so depending on where you live and what network you’re on, you may not be missing out on much right now if you buy a phone that doesn’t support it. It’s a similar situation for Wi-Fi 7, which is available on some high-end handsets like the Galaxy S25, but harder to find on cheaper devices. Wi-Fi 7 also requires you to have a compatible router, so unless you know you need it or have a specific use case in mind, the lack of support for mmWave 5G or Wi-Fi 7 shouldn’t be a dealbreaker when looking for a new phone.\nOther features to consider\nBecause not everyone agrees on what makes the best phone, you should think about any other specs that might be extra important for you. Mobile gamers will almost certainly appreciate the 120Hz refresh rates you get on phones like the Samsung Galaxy S25 or the Apple iPhone 16 Pro. Alternatively, if long battery life is important, you’ll probably want to go with a larger iPhone or an Android phone with a battery that’s between 4,000 and 5,000 mAh in size. Meanwhile, if you find yourself juggling a lot of devices, it can be really nice to have a phone that supports reverse wireless charging, which on Samsung phones even lets you recharge the company’s Galaxy Watches.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther smartphones we've tested\nSamsung Galaxy S25 Ultra\nLike its predecessor, the S25 Ultra is an incredibly versatile phone. It’s one of the few handsets that come with an included stylus and premium features like a gorgeous 6.9-inch AMOLED display, titanium frame and a 5x telephoto camera. It also has excellent performance and strong battery life. The issue is that, aside from improved AI, this year’s phone doesn’t offer that much more than the previous model (or the one before that), and with prices starting at $1,300, we feel it needs to do more to earn a top pick spot.\nOnePlus 13\nWhile the OnePlus 13 features some basic AI features like Google’s Circle to Search and Gemini assistant, it’s really just an old-fashioned flagship in all the best ways. That’s because instead of focusing on machine learning, OnePlus crammed the phone with tons of top-notch hardware. It sports a 6.8-inch OLED display with an incredible peak brightness of up to 4,500 nits. The OP13 also offers excellent performance thanks to Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 8 Elite chip, along with 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage. There are also three 50-MP rear cameras including one with a 3x telephoto zoom and a massive 6,000 mAh battery that’s bigger than what you get in practically all of its competitors.\nOnePlus didn’t skimp on the phone’s design either, as the OP13 still comes with the company’s signature Alert Slider. Plus, if you opt for the blue or white variants, you’ll get a durable and very touchable vegan leather back that helps the phone stand out among all its glass brick rivals. But the best part is that starting at $900, it costs less than an equivalent Galaxy S25+ too.\nFAQs\nHow do I know which smartphone is the best for me?\nWhile choosing the best smartphone can be challenging, it mostly comes down to how you plan on using the device. All of the best phones available now get the basics right — you’ll be able to make calls, text and access the internet without many hiccups. If your smartphone is your most used gadget, you may want to consider paying for a device on the higher end of the price spectrum. That will get you better overall performance, higher-quality cameras and a phone that will last for many years. If you don’t use your phone for everything, you may be able to compromise on performance and extra perks and spend less on a still-capable handset.\nHow much is a smartphone?\nSmartphones range in price from $300 to over $1,500. The best budget phones available now will usually compromise on overall performance, design, camera prowess and extra features to keep costs down. On the flip side, the most expensive phones will have powerful processors, triple-camera arrays and even flip or fold designs. Most people will find a phone that fits their needs somewhere in the middle of that wide price range — we’ve found that most of the best smartphones available right now cost between $500 and $1,000.\nWhat can you do on a smartphone?\nSmartphones are essentially small, portable computers that let you do things like check email, browse social media, follow map directions, make contactless payments and more. This is all on top of the basics like making phone calls and texting, which we’ve come to expect in all modern cell phones. Smartphones have also mostly replaced compact cameras thanks to their high-quality, built-in shooters, and the fact that most smartphones today as just as portable, if not more so, as compact cameras.\nHow long do smartphones last?\nSmartphones can last years and people are holding on to their phones longer now than ever before. Software updates and battery life are two of the biggest factors that can affect phone longevity. Apple promises five years worth of software updates for its latest iPhones, and Google promises the same for its Pixel phones. Samsung phones will get four years worth of Android updates from the time they launch. As for charging speeds and battery life, your phone can deteriorate over time as you use and recharge your phone on a regular basis.\nRecent updates\nJuly 2025: Updated to include the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7.\nApril 2025: Updated to include the Google Pixel 9a.\nFebruary 2025: Updated to include the iPhone 16e.\nJanuary 2025: Updated to include details about Samsung's latest Galaxy S-series phones.\nSeptember 2024: Updated to include the latest iPhone 16 models and a new midrange iPhone top pick.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/best-smartphones-140004900.html?src=rss",

As we discovered in our testing for the iPhone 16 Pro review, it’ll take a bit of getting used to at first. The Pixel 9 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro both start at $999, and though some of us have come to think of Google's handsets as the more competitively priced option, this year's model might be good enough to justify a premium price. So while it's not super fancy, the phone has all of its most important bases covered (and then some). Samsung says this is its brightest foldable display yet, making it easier to use and read outdoors. But the best part is that starting at $900, it costs less than an equivalent Galaxy S25+ too. Smartphones can last years and people are holding on to their phones longer now than ever before."

Zuckerberg and the others will actually be paying out to Meta shareholders as a recompense for damages allegedly caused by allowing repeated violations of Facebook users' privacy.\nThe parties have not disclosed the details of the settlement, but one would assume the payout was less than the $8 billion the plaintiffs originally asked for. Judge Kathaleen McCormick adjourned the trial just as it was set to enter its second day and well before any of the major players were forced to take the stand.\nBillionaire venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, who is a defendant in the trial and a Meta director, was scheduled to testify today. Zuckerberg and former COO Sheryl Sandberg were set to take the stand next week. Former board member Peter Thiel was also expected to testify.\nShareholders sued Zuckerberg, Andreessen, Sandberg and others to hold them liable for the billions of dollars in fines and legal costs the company has been forced to pay out in recent years as part of alleged privacy violations. For instance, the FTC fined Facebook $5 billion in 2019 after finding it failed to comply with a 2012 agreement to protect user data.\nCompany shareholders wanted the 11 defendants to use their personal wealth to reimburse the company. Plaintiffs alleged in the suit that the defendants failed to oversee FTC compliance and that they knowingly ran Facebook as an illegal data harvesting operation. The defendants denied the allegations, calling them \"extreme claims\", before settling.\n\nThis all goes back to the infamous Cambridge Analytica bombshell, in which the political consulting firm accessed data from millions of Facebook users as part of Donald Trump's successful 2016 presidential campaign. That led to the FTC fine, which was the largest ever issued at the time. Cambridge Analytica has since shuttered.\nSeveral people had already taken the stand before both parties reached a settlement. An expert witness for the plaintiffs testified about \"gaps and weaknesses\" in Facebook's privacy policies.\nThis is just one pending case against the company. There's a big antitrust case that once again pits the FTC against Meta, alleging that the company participated in anticompetitive practices by purchasing one-time rivals Instagram and Whatsapp. The trial has ended but no decision has been reached.\nZuckerberg has been implicated in a case that alleges Meta knowingly used pirated materials to train its Llama AI. The company is also paying $25 million to settle a lawsuit with Donald Trump over his 2021 Facebook suspension, after Trump threatened Zuckerberg with retribution during the 2024 election. The current president was temporarily suspended from the platform after inciting a riot at the capitol that left several people dead.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/mark-zuckerberg-and-other-meta-bigwigs-just-agreed-to-a-settlement-in-8-billion-suit-154513933.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "\"This is probably the most uncertain future NASA has faced, maybe since the end of Apollo,\" Casey Dreier tells me over the phone. Dreier is the chief of space policy at The Planetary Society, a nonprofit that advocates for the exploration and study of space.\nOn July 10, the Senate Appropriations Committee met to discuss the proposed federal Commerce, Justice and Science budget for 2026. While on average, funding for NASA has accounted for about 0.3 percent of total yearly spending by the federal government since the start of the 2010s, President Trump has called for a 24 percent cut year over year to the agency's operating allowance. By any metric, his plan would be devastating.\nAdjusted for inflation, it would leave NASA with the smallest operating budget it has had since Russian cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin became the first human to travel to space in 1961. In the process, it would eviscerate the agency's science budget by nearly half, resulting in the termination of 55 ongoing and or planned missions. It would also leave NASA with its smallest workforce in 70 years. All this, at a time when the agency has been tasked with returning to the Moon and bringing the first humans to Mars.\n\"There's no historical precedent to this level of single year, functionally indiscriminate and dramatic cuts. You lose, in one year, a third of all active science projects. [The Trump administration is] proposing to turn off missions that are performing not just good science, but unique and irreplaceable science. This isn't so they can reinvest the money in some radical new science efforts. No, the money is gone,\" said Dreier. \"It's almost certainly the greatest threat to NASA science activities in the history of the space agency.\"\nDreier isn't exaggerating when he says some missions would be impossible to replace. One of the casualties of Trump's cuts would be the New Horizons probe. In 2015, New Horizons gave us our best look at Pluto ever. Four years later, it performed the farthest flyby in human history. As things stand, it's the only active spacecraft in the Kuiper belt, a region of our solar system that is not well-understood by scientists. Even if NASA were to start working on a replacement today, it would take a generation for that vehicle to reach where New Horizons is right now. It costs NASA about $14.7 million per year to continue operating the probe, a fraction of the $29.9 billion in additional funding Congress allocated to fund ICE enforcement and detainment operations in the president's recently passed tax bill.\nHeather Roper\nAnother mission that would be impossible to replace is OSIRIS-APEX. If the name sounds familiar, it's because OSRIS-APEX is a continuation of NASA's incredibly successful OSRIS-REx flight. In 2020, the spacecraft visited 101955 Bennu, an ancient asteroid about the size of the Empire State Building, and collected a sample of regolith (rocks and dirt) from its surface using a never-before-tried technique.\nAfter OSRIS-REx successfully returned the sample to Earth, NASA decided to extend the spacecraft's mission and fly to another asteroid, 99942 Apophis. In 2029, Apophis will pass about 19,600 miles from Earth. It will be the closest approach of any known asteroid of its size. NASA said the extension would add $200 million to a mission that had already cost it an estimated $1.16 billion.\n\"This project is a pennies on the dollar repurposing of an existing spacecraft. It's the only American spacecraft that will be at Apophis for a once in a generation opportunity to study an asteroid that will just barely miss us,\" said Dreier. \"That seems important to know.\"\nAt a time when nearly every facet of American life is being upturned, the potential cancellation of dozens of NASA missions might seem a distant concern, but the gutting of the agency's science budget would have a ripple effect on communities across the US.\n\"NASA is an engine for jobs in the country, and for every NASA job, there are many more that are created in the private workforce,\" said Bethany Ehlmann, Professor of Planetary Science at the California Institute of Technology. She also serves on the board of directors for The Planetary Society.\nProfessor Ehlmann's claim is supported by NASA's own data. In 2023, the agency employed 17,823 full-time civil servants nationwide. With NASA's private sector support factored in, that year the agency's missions were responsible for sustaining 304,803 jobs across all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Put another way, for every full-time equivalent job at a NASA facility, NASA supports at least 16 private sector jobs. \"Space science has been broadly supported and impacts roughly three quarters of every congressional district in the country,\" said Dreier. \"It's not just a red or blue state thing.\"\nFollowing last week's Senate meeting, policymakers from both parties said they would push back on President Trump's NASA budget cuts. On Tuesday, the House Appropriations Committee's Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science and Related Agencies passed a funding bill that would provide NASA with a total budget of $24.8 billion for 2026, or the same amount it was allocated this year. The week before, the corresponding subcommittee in the Senate passed its own NASA funding bill.\nThe two versions differ on one critical detail. The Senate legislation maintains the agency's science budget at $7.3 billion, while the House version seeks to reduce it by 18 percent to $6 billion. Separately, the House is calling for a 23 percent cut to the National Science Foundation's budget. NSF funds much of the nation's astronomy research.\n\"What I'm hearing from lawmakers is that they understand how important NASA is to industry. They understand how important NASA is to universities in terms of training, and providing grants that train the next generation of the space workforce,\" said Professor Ehlmann, who was on Capitol Hill last week. The House and Senate will need to come to an agreement for the bill to move forward.\nEven with many lawmakers in favor of maintaining NASA's budget, a flat budget is still a funding cut when accounting for inflation. Moreover, NASA has already been negatively affected by the Trump administration's efforts to trim the federal workforce.\nAccording to reporting Politico published on July 9, 2,694 NASA employees have agreed to leave the agency through either early retirement, a buyout or a deferred resignation. Of those individuals, 2,145 are workers in senior positions and 1,818 are staff serving in missions areas like human spaceflight and science. \"Once the workforce is gone, they're gone. You lose a ton of institutional knowledge,\" said Dreier. The employees who have agreed to leave represent about 15 percent of NASA's 2023 workforce of 17,823. With the July 25 deadline for early retirement, voluntary separation and deferred resignations quickly approaching, that number is likely to grow. NASA's shifting priorities under the Trump administration have also created uncertainty among the agency's contractors.\nAccording to former NASA employee and NASA Watch creator Keith Cowing the workforce cuts are already affecting employees. \"In the 40 years I've been involved with NASA in one way or another, I've never seen morale so bad,\" he said. \"Is NASA bloated? Yeah, but the way you deal with bloat is to go in with a scalpel and you cut carefully. And yet you have people [like Elon Musk] standing on stage with chainsaws. That is not the way to run government, and it's certainly not the way to create the machinery needed to explore the universe.\"\nWhatever happens next, Dreier worries there's the potential for there to be an erosion in public support for NASA. He points to a survey published by Pew Research. In 2023, the organization found that monitoring for asteroids that could hit Earth and tracking changes to the planet's climate were the two activities Americans wanted NASA to prioritize over other mandates. By contrast, sending human astronauts to the Moon and Mars were the least important priorities for the public.\nREUTERS / Reuters\nThe House version of NASA's 2026 budget would boost the agency's exploration budget by 25 percent to $9.7 billion. In Trump's tax bill, Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) included language that provided NASA with $4.1 billion for the fourth and fifth flights of the Space Launch System (SLS) rocket — the vehicle intended to carry the first NASA astronauts back to the Moon before before private sector alternatives like SpaceX's Starship are ready to fly.\nWith both the Trump administration and House pushing Moon and Mars missions as priorities, Dreier says they're \"ironically doubling down on the activities that the private sector is already doing — SpaceX says it's going to send humans to Mars — and abandoning the things that only NASA does. There's no private sector company doing space science.\"\nIn effect, a NASA budget that sacrifices on scientific research in lieu of Mars missions would be one that invests in things the public says are the least important to it.\n\"I worry that they're moving away from what the public expects their space agency to do, and that as a consequence, it will undermine public investment in NASA,\" he said. \"NASA is usually tied for the number one or two most popular federal agency. People wear NASA t-shirts. No one wears a Department of the Interior t-shirt walking out of the GAP. It's a rare and precious thing to have, and they're risking it. It's not just the future of the agency that's at risk, but the future of the public's relationship with it.\"\nWhen asked for comment on this story, Bethany Stevens, NASA's press secretary, pointed Engadget to a letter from Acting Administrator Janet Petro NASA shared in a technical supplement it published alongside the president's budget request.\n\"We must continue to be responsible stewards of taxpayer dollars. That means making strategic decisions — including scaling back or discontinuing ineffective efforts not aligned with our Moon and Mars exploration priorities\" Petro wrote.\nThe final NASA budget for 2026 is still months away from being finalized. After Tuesday's vote, the two funding bills will move to the full Senate and House appropriations committees for a vote and further revisions. Only after that will every member of each chamber get a chance to vote on the matter. Congress has until September 30 to complete the appropriations process before 2025 funding runs out. President Trump could also decide to veto the bill if it doesn't align with his priorities.\nHave a tip for Igor?

The Block CEO put those together under the auspices of a new development collective called \"and Other Stuff,\" a nonprofit that he is backing with a $10 million cash injection through his StartSmall foundation, as TechCrunch reports.\nThe group plans to work on open-source projects, including ones that could become consumer social media apps, along with app-development tools. The developers met on Nostr, a social networking protocol Dorsey has also backed financially. \nThe \"and Other Stuff\" collective aims to support Nostr's \"transition from an experimental protocol to a widely adopted, sustainable ecosystem through collaborative growth and funding.\" In addition to Nostr projects, the collaborators plan to experiment with building tools based on the likes of ActivityPub — which powers Mastodon — and Cashu. That e-cash platform's creator, dubbed Calle, is part of the \"and other Stuff\" team alongside Twitter’s first employee, Evan Henshaw-Plath.\nThe projects that \"and Other Stuff\" has worked on so far include voice note app heynow, a private messenger app called White Noise and social community +chorus. They have also created Shakespeare, which is designed to help developers build Nostr-based social apps with AI.\nDorsey has long fostered an interest in open-source protocols. In 2019, during his second stint as Twitter CEO, the company set up a team that was tasked with forming an open, decentralized standard for social media. Dorsey had hoped to eventually shift Twitter onto that protocol, but of course that didn't pan out. Instead, Twitter spun out that project — Bluesky — as a public benefit corporation in 2022. Last year, after leaving Bluesky's board, Dorsey claimed that the team there was \"literally repeating all the mistakes\" he made while running Twitter such as, uh, setting up moderation tools (which are, in reality, a critically important aspect of any successful social platform).\nOn an episode of Henshaw-Plath's new podcast, Dorsey reiterated a point he had made previously, that Twitter was beholden to advertisers (an issue that X is contending with under Elon Musk's ownership). \"It’s hard for something like [Twitter] to be a company, because you have corporate incentives when it wants to be a protocol,\" Dorsey said. \"If [Twitter] were an open protocol, if it were truly an open project, you could build a business on top of it, and you could build a very healthy business on top of it.\"\nHe was also once again critical of Bluesky's structure, adding that, \"I want to push the energy in a different direction... which is more like Bitcoin, which is completely open and not owned by anyone from a protocol layer. That’s what I see in Nostr as well. That’s where I want to push my energy... rather into the more corporate direction, even if it is a public benefit corporation.\"This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/jack-dorsey-backs-an-open-source-development-collective-with-10-million-140052825.html?src=rss",

Virtuos says it's offering affected workers layoff packages, career transition assistance and, \"where possible,\" job opportunities across its network. \n\"Over the past 12 months, Virtuos has deepened its commitment to premium co-development through key acquisitions of Beyond-FX, Pipeworks, and Umanaïa in North America, as well as Third Kind Games and Abstraction in Europe,\" Virtuos said in a statement. \"These studios enhance our strengths in VFX, design, Unreal Engine programming and creative development. This ongoing investment reflects our intent to grow in areas where our expertise and scale create lasting value, while selectively exiting service segments where demand is weakening. We need to better match the locations of our teams with those of our clients to support the increasingly iterative nature of creative co-development. This alignment is why the current reorganization has a greater impact on our teams in Asia.\"\nBesides reviving Bethesda classics, Virtuos has contributed work to the upcoming Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater and several ongoing live service games, like Dune: Awakening  and Sea of Thieves. Nothing about the company's output or the critical reception of its games would suggest it needs to conduct layoffs, but that reflects the current precarious state of the games industry. Even having theoretically steady work doing post-release support and game remasters isn't enough.\nVirtuos' layoffs follows the sweeping cuts Microsoft made to its Xbox division in early July. Microsoft reportedly cancelled games, like Rare's long-in-development Everwild, and shutdown whole studios, like The Initiative. Romero Games, which had an unannounced funding deal with Microsoft, was also forced to cancel its current project, though it hopes to find a new publishing partner.\nUpdate July 17, 2025, 9:57AM ET: Added confirmation of the layoffs from Virtuos.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/virtuos-the-studio-behind-oblivion-remastered-is-laying-off-around-270-employees-135722222.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Stellantis, the automotive giant behind Chrysler, Citroen, Fiat, Jeep and Peugeot, is pulling out of hydrogen. The company said it’s killing its fuel cell development program in the face of  “limited availability of hydrogen refueling infrastructure, high capital requirements and the need for stronger consumer purchasing incentives.” To put that another way, it’s realized hydrogen EVs are facing the same set of challenges it’s not been able to overcome in the last two or three decades.\nIt’s a stark shift in tone from January 2024, when the company promised to roll out a fleet of commercial fuel cell vehicles. Stellantis sells many of Europe’s most popular panel vans including the Citroen Jumper, Fiat Ducato, Opel Movano and Peugeot Boxer. Back then, it said we’d see hydrogen versions of all those vehicles (as well as its smaller siblings) with maximum ranges of 500km (310 miles).\nThe decision to pull the plug came relatively late, with the company saying it was due to begin production at its plants in France and Poland “this summer.” It added the decision to kill the range will not impact staffing in production or R&D, with employees transferred to other projects. It will, however, have to delicately negotiate its exit with Symbio, the fuel cell maker it bought a one-third share of back in 2023.\nStellantis isn’t the first company that pledged to put its weight behind fuel cells only to pull back. Toyota has thrown a lot of time, effort and money behind hydrogen, believing fuel cells would be preferable to battery electric vehicles (BEVs). Sadly, as time progressed, the company has had to cede more and more of the market to batteries, and only advertises its third-generation fuel cell as a power unit for heavy industrial vehicles.\nHydrogen was, and has been for some time, an article of faith for fossil fuel companies, the car industry and even some countries that lack their own energy reserves. After all, the promise of being able to pull (theoretically limitless), emission-free energy out of water is the stuff of dreams. Not to mention, it requires much of the same knowledge and infrastructure used by the traditional oil and gas industry, and refueling can only take place at a commercial site.\nHad hydrogen made more of an impact, it would have likely preserved the status quo or something much like it, for those industries long into the future. But while the hope was that hydrogen could be a cleaner, greener substitute for oil and gas, its inherent flaws always made that a non-starter.\nFor instance, hydrogen is far less energy dense than oil and gas, and far less physically dense — it’s so prone to leaking that you have to go above and beyond to seal it in. It’s difficult to mass produce cleanly, especially if you want to power every car in the world, unless you use a dirty process like the steam reformation of methane. So, rather than moving away from fossil fuels and emissions, you’d be further entrenching them into the system and adding to the problem.\nAnd if you did want to just use renewable energy to pull hydrogen from water, then you’d require an unprecedented amount of investment. Back in 2021, I asked Tim Lord, who had previously been in charge of the UK’s decarbonization strategy, about that sort of industrial-scale hydrogen generation. He said that you’d essentially need to double your whole electricity generation output to get close.\nThat’s before you get to the other factors, like hydrogen’s efficiency as a store of energy or the investment necessary to equip every gas station on the planet with a hydrogen tank. Which is not likely going to pay off given that Toyota’s Mirai, arguably the flagship hydrogen fuel cell EV, has only sold 28,000 models since its launch in 2014. In the US market, there's only the Mirai, the Hyundai Nexo and the Honda CR-V e-FCEV knocking around, nothing compared to how many BEVs are on sale. I think it’s time for everyone to admit that we’re done with hydrogen fuel cell EVs and focus their attention elsewhere.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/another-big-car-company-gives-up-on-hydrogen-133011978.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Since rolling out the redesign of its Firefly app in April, Adobe has been releasing major updates for the generative AI hub at a near monthly clip. Today, the company is introducing a handful of new features to assist those who use Firefly's video capabilities.\nTo start, Adobe is making it easier to add sound effects to AI-generated clips. Right now, the majority of video models create footage without any accompanying audio. Adobe is addressing this with a nifty little feature that allows users to first describe the sound effect they want to generate and then record themselves making it. The second part isn't so Adobe's model can mimic the sound. Rather, it's so the system can get a better idea of the intensity and timing the user wants from the effect.\nIn the demo Adobe showed me, one of the company's employees used the feature to add the sound of a zipper being unzipped. They made a \"zzzztttt\" sound, which Adobe's model faithfully used to reproduce the effect at the intended volume. The translation was less convincing when the employee used the tool to add the sound of footsteps on concrete, though if you're using the feature for ideation as Adobe intended, that may not matter. When adding sound effects, there's a timeline editor along the bottom of the interface to make it easy to time the audio properly.\nAdobe\nThe other new features Adobe is adding today are called Composition Reference, Keyframe Cropping and Video Presets. The first of those allows you to upload a video or image you captured to guide the generation process. In combination with Video Presets, you can define the style of the final output. Some of the options Adobe is offering at launch allow you to create clips with anime, black and white or vector art styles. Lastly, with Keyframe Cropping you can upload the first and final frame of a video and select an aspect ratio. Firefly will then generate a video that stays within your desired format.\nIn June, Adobe added support for additional third-party models, and this month it's doing the same. Most notable is the inclusion of Veo 3, which Google premiered at its I/O 2025 conference in May. At the moment, Veo 3 is one of the only AI models that can generate video with sound. Like with all the other partner models Adobe offers in Firefly, Google has agreed not to use data from Adobe users for training future models. Every image and video people create through Firefly is digitally signed with the model that was used to create it. That is one of the safeguards Adobe includes so that Firefly customers don't accidentally ship an asset that infringes on copyrighted material.\nAccording to Zeke Koch, vice president of product management for Adobe Firefly, users can expect the fast pace of updates to continue. \"We're relentlessly shipping stuff almost as quickly as we can,\" he said. Koch adds Adobe will continue to integrate more third-party models, as long as their providers agree to the company's data privacy terms.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/adobe-firefly-can-now-generate-sound-effects-from-your-audio-cues-130008172.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "After several generations of iterative updates, it feels like Samsung tossed the Galaxy Z Fold 7 into a Hyperbolic Time Chamber to create a stunning device that's leaner, stronger and more powerful than before. The best part though is the phone looks and functions just like a regular handset now that there’s less bulk to lug around. But at a moment's notice, it can go Super Saiyan by opening up to reveal an even larger 8-inch display to become a true multimedia raidboss. Unfortunately, it's still extremely expensive at $2,000. Though if you can handle the price, in a lot of ways, Samsung has finally achieved foldable phone nirvana with the Galaxy Z Fold 7.\nDesign: Chef's kiss\nWhen Samsung debuted its updated super sleek design language on the Galaxy S25 Edge, it felt like a novel way to reimagine the S25+ as a more engaging device. But when the company gave the same treatment to the Z Fold 7, that engineering became something truly transformative. Compared to its predecessor, Samsung's big foldable for 2025 is 10 percent lighter at just 215 grams. The bigger drop comes in thickness with Galaxy Z Fold 7 measuring a whopping 26 percent thinner (just 8.9mm when folded). This represents the biggest generation-over-generation decrease for the entire Z Fold line, which is kind of shocking considering it's happening seven years in. The result is a foldable that is basically the same size and weight as the Galaxy S25 Ultra (it's actually a little narrower), which is no mean feat for a class of gadgets that has been plagued by extra heft since they first came out. \n\n\nWhat might be just as impressive is that Samsung hasn't really cut corners to deliver the Z Fold 7's streamlined dimensions. You still get an IP48 rating for dust and water resistance (which can handle submersions of up to 5 feet for 30 minutes) along with Gorilla Glass Ceramic 2 in front and Gorilla Glass Victus 2 in back. Samsung also completely re-engineered its Armor FlexHinge, which glides open and closed like a dream. Samsung even says that Z Fold 7's ultra-thin glass is 50 percent thicker than before while also sporting a new titanium lattice that adds additional support and durability to the phone's flexible display.\nInside, Samsung has switched away from the under-display sensor used on previous models in favor of a more traditional hole-punch camera. This is a bit of a shame as it adds a small blemish to that otherwise gorgeous screen. However, with the panel now measuring 8 inches across (up from 7.6 on the Z Fold 6), there's more of it to enjoy even after you account for the small cutout. Plus, the move to a higher-res 10-megapixel sensor for this camera results in significantly better image quality than any of Samsung's under-display modules.\n\n\n\n\n  Sam Rutherford for Engadget\n \n\nThe one small design quirk is that sometimes the phone doesn't unfold all the way, often stopping just short at 179 degrees — much like the original Pixel Fold. That said, you can always make it go fully flat with a bit of extra pressure, though most of the time I don't even bother because this is the kind of thing that you don't really notice unless you're specifically looking for it.\nDisplays: Now even bigger, both inside and out\nAs for brightness and image quality, Samsung's panels are still unmatched. In addition to a larger main display, the Z Fold 7's exterior Cover Screen is slightly bigger at 6.5 inches. More importantly, it's noticeably wider too while sporting even thinner bezels, which makes the whole phone feel more usable. The feeling of holding a skinny baton I got on previous models is completely gone. Both screens also support a 120Hz refresh rate and can hit a peak brightness of 2,600 nits. And when compared to rivals like the Pixel 9 Pro Fold, the Fold 7's displays just pop a touch more thanks to slightly richer colors and saturation.\n\n\n\n\n  Sam Rutherford for Engadget\n \n\nAfter introducing S Pen integration on the Z Fold 3, Samsung has removed stylus support for this model — a big downgrade that may anger longtime Z Fold fans. The company claims it made this decision after seeing \"very low\" S Pen usage on previous generations, which frankly isn't all that surprising. But, as one of the highlight features that separated Samsung's big foldables from practically all of its rivals, it's still sad to see it go.\nPerformance and software: The fastest big foldable phone\nThe Galaxy Z Fold 7 unquestionably packs top-tier performance. It's powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chip along with 12GB or 16GB of RAM and up to 1TB of storage. Everything feels fast and snappy while OneUI 8 and Android 16 bring app optimizations that help make the most of the phone's big display.\n\n\n\n\n  Sam Rutherford for Engadget\n \n\nThe biggest eye-opener for me was when I compared how long it took the Z Fold 7 to launch my current favorite mobile game, Sword of Convallaria, against the Pixel 9 Pro Fold. Even with the increased performance of Google's recent Tensor chips, Samsung's foldable loaded the game in 13 seconds compared to 18 seconds for the Pixel. That might not sound like a ton, but it’s around 25 percent faster and when it's something you do multiple times a day, shaving off even a few seconds adds up fast..\nCameras: A major resolution bump\nWhile the Z Fold 7's ultrawide and 3x telephoto cameras are largely unchanged, the phone features a big photo upgrade thanks to a new 200MP sensor for its main camera. This is essentially the same component Samsung used in the S25 Ultra and S25 Edge, and it delivers a much-needed bump in image quality.\n\n\n\n\n  Sam Rutherford for Engadget\n \n\nIn bright light, the Z Fold 7 easily keeps pace with the Pixel 9 Pro Fold. In certain situations like when snapping pics of food, some may prefer its shots thanks to Samsung's warmer color profile. The phone still tends to oversharpen things, but colors are vibrant. For those who want to maximize resolution, you can select the phone's full 200MP mode (images are captured at 12MP by default). At night, the Fold 7's shots remained surprisingly sharp. I still prefer the Pixel 9 Pro Fold due to its more accurate white balance and often sharper focus, though Samsung's phone isn't far behind.\nPotentially the biggest shortcoming on the Fold 7 is that its 3x optical zoom can't quite match the 5x telephoto cam on the Pixel 9 Pro Fold. But for fans of group shots, Samsung added a new selfie camera with a wider 100-degree field of view.\nBattery life and charging: Solid longevity, but still only Qi 2 ready\nWhile the Z Fold 7's 4,400mAh battery is the same size as its predecessor, you will get slightly increased longevity due to improved power efficiency from its processor. In our local video rundown test, the Z Fold 7 lasted 20 hours and 50 minutes when using its main 8-inch display and 26 hours and 22 minutes with its exterior screen. Depending on which display you use, that's between 45 minutes and an hour longer than what we got from the previous model, which is nice to see considering battery life was already pretty solid.\n\n\n\n\n  Sam Rutherford for Engadget\n \n\nSadly, Samsung hasn't changed much when it comes to recharging. The Z Fold 7 supports wired charging at up to 25 watts — which is rather average for a modern flagship — alongside 15 watt wireless charging. And like the rest of the 2025 premium Galaxy line, this phone is merely Qi 2 ready, which means there's no built-in attachment system for magnetic accessories like charging pucks, card holders and battery packs. So if you want to use peripherals like those, you'll need to get a case with full support for Qi 2.\nWrap-up\nI've always said that Samsung is at its best when it focuses on hardware design, and the Galaxy Z Fold 7 may be one of the best examples of that. With its latest flagship foldable, Samsung has removed one of the remaining barriers preventing people from trying out the new breed of phones: excessive size and weight.\nBy widening its cover display, the Z Fold 7 looks and acts just like a regular smartphone, which is great for checking messages, looking up directions or snapping a photo. When you want to get really immersed in a show, movie or game, you can open up that beautiful flexible display, which is now even larger for your viewing pleasure. The phone’s higher-res main camera also brings upgraded image quality while its Snapdragon 8 Elite chip gives it a performance edge over rivals like the Pixel 9 Pro Fold.\n\n\n\n\n  Sam Rutherford for Engadget\n \n\nI don't love how Samsung is backtracking on features by removing S Pen support and reverting to an old-school camera cutout instead of an under-display sensor for its main display. But at least in the case of the latter, that change comes with much improved image quality, which is a big upgrade for video calls.\nWith the Galaxy Z Fold 7, you really do get the best of both worlds. Its new design is just as sleek as comparable traditional flagships while hiding a larger display that makes the need for small tablets obsolete. Unfortunately, with a starting price of $2,000, Samsung hasn't addressed the last roadblock stopping people from trying out a device that might completely change the way they use their phone.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review-foldable-phone-nirvana-for-a-price-123004636.html?src=rss",
    "full_text": "Compared to its predecessor, Samsung's big foldable for 2025 is 10 percent lighter at just 215 grams. The bigger drop comes in thickness with Galaxy Z Fold 7 measuring a whopping 26 percent thinner (just 8.9mm when folded). What might be just as impressive is that Samsung hasn't really cut corners to deliver the Z Fold 7's streamlined dimensions. Inside, Samsung has switched away from the under-display sensor used on previous models in favor of a more traditional hole-punch camera. Plus, the move to a higher-res 10-megapixel sensor for this camera results in significantly better image quality than any of Samsung's under-display modules. In addition to a larger main display, the Z Fold 7's exterior Cover Screen is slightly bigger at 6.5 inches. The company claims it made this decision after seeing \"very low\" S Pen usage on previous generations, which frankly isn't all that surprising. In certain situations like when snapping pics of food, some may prefer its shots thanks to Samsung's warmer color profile. For those who want to maximize resolution, you can select the phone's full 200MP mode (images are captured at 12MP by default). I still prefer the Pixel 9 Pro Fold due to its more accurate white balance and often sharper focus, though Samsung's phone isn't far behind."

While the company originally announced the game for iOS 26 at WWDC earlier this year, the Emoji Game is now available to subscribers on iPhone, iPad and Mac running iOS 18.4, iPadOS 18.4 and macOS 15.4 or later, respectively. The game is similar to other word games out there like Wordle in that players would have to fill in the blanks to guess words and phrases. But like its name implies, players will have to fill the blanked-out letters with emoji instead.\nIf the letters for \"apple\" are missing in the word \"pineapple,\" for instance, users would have to use the \"apple\" emoji to complete the word. For the phrase \"the night is young,\" players can choose the baby emoji if it's the word \"young\" that's missing. In addition to standard emoji, the game also uses Genmoji, which are custom emoji created using Apple Intelligence. For each round of the game, players will have to complete three phrases. They can reveal the clues baked into the phrases if they want, but it will use up one of their moves, which are limited in number.\nNews+ subscribers will be able to play the game in the Puzzles section of the Apple News app. Later this year, they'll be able to play it in the upcoming dedicated Apple Games app, as well. An Apple's News+ subscription costs $13 a month. It gives subscribers access to magazines and newspapers, audio stories and regional publications, along with daily puzzles like crosswords and sudoku. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/apples-emoji-game-is-now-out-for-news-subscribers-in-the-us-and-canada-121505775.html?src=rss",

The company is introducing a series of tools aimed at improving productivity and improving team communication.\nAI writing assistance has been built directly into Slack Canvas, allowing users to create assets like project briefs as well as refine the content they create using natural‑language prompts. Writing assistance can also be used to generate and assign action items, refine raw meeting notes, create FAQs and more. AI writing assistance seems to be in vogue, as Google has also been developing AI writing assistance tools integrated into Google Workspace, and Apple offers similar tools via Apple Intelligence.\nSlack\nAI message context will help users understand the lingo of their organization and help ensure they don’t get lost in long threads by pulling surrounding context to explain a message when a user hovers over it. This tool will provide explanations for project names, internal tools or team‑specific shorthand. This will presumably help new team members get up to speed more quickly while they learn whatever random acronyms their company uses. AI‑generated channel recaps and thread summaries will similarly help users catch up when joining an ongoing project or conversation.\nIf you’re heads down working on a high‑priority task, Slack will use AI action items to understand what you’re working on and only interrupt your workflow if something provides a meaningful update or is more important than what you’re working on at the time.\nSlack\nThe company also said it will be widening the availability of AI translation, which allows teammates to read and contribute in their preferred language, as well as Enterprise Search, which surfaces information across connected apps, data and conversations from the likes of Salesforce, Microsoft Teams, Google Drive and more.\nSlack\nSlack has been rapidly incorporating AI tools into the platform recently. This should come as no surprise since Slack has been owned by Salesforce since 2021. The software company is among the most bullish on the future of AI and its applications in the workplace. We know that Slack has been using data from your chats to train its machine‑learning models, and recently Salesforce moved to ensure that rival software firms were not using or accessing the same data.\nThese tools and more are available to users with a paid Slack plan, though not every new AI tool is included at the lower price tiers. The higher the subscription tier, the more of these tools are included. Slack says that Enterprise Search, channel recaps, AI meeting notes and translations are available now. In contrast, AI‑assisted message explanations, action items, writing assistance in Canvas and profile summaries are coming soon and may be released throughout the year.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/slack-is-getting-a-host-of-new-ai-tools-120023607.html?src=rss",

The accounting fraud and stock manipulation charges stemmed from a merger of two Samsung subsidiaries in 2015. Prosecutors had accused Lee of manipulating share prices to help clear the way for the merger in an attempt to consolidate his power.\nIn 2024, a court ruled that the prosecutors failed to prove their claims. The case has worked through the appeals process since then. In a statement to Reuters, Samsung's lawyers said the latest ruling confirmed that the merger had been completed legally and added they were \"sincerely grateful\" to the Supreme Court.\nBack in 2017, Lee was sentenced to five years in prison after being convicted of bribing public officials with regards to the merger. However, the Supreme Court overturned the decision and ordered a re-trial. As a result of that, Lee was handed a 30-month prison sentence and served 18 months before being paroled. Then-South Korea President Yoon Suk Yeol (who was removed from office this year and recently rearrested over a failed martial law attempt in 2024) later pardoned Lee.\nWhile the Supreme Court's ruling had been widely expected, it clears \"a layer of legal uncertainty\" related to Samsung, one analyst said. It will allow Lee to focus more of his attention on Samsung, which earlier this month projected a 56 percent drop in operating profit for the April-June quarter compared with the same period in 2024. That is due, in large part, to sluggish sales of its AI chips.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/samsung-chairman-cleared-of-fraud-by-south-koreas-top-court-113043402.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Roblox is joining the growing ranks of online platforms that are trying to better understand the ages of their teen users. The company is rolling out a new \"age estimation\" feature for teens 13 and older.\nWith the update, teens will be prompted for an age check that requires a video selfie in order to access its new less restrictive chat feature called \"trusted connections.\" Roblox is relying on third-party identity company Persona for the actual \"estimation,\" and users who fail the check will also have the option of providing an ID. Once teens have \"unlocked\" trusted connections via video selfie or sharing an ID, they'll be able to participate in chats with friends \"without filters,\" including \"party\" group text and voice chats.\nRoblox has previously faced scrutiny for not policing its chat features enough and making it too easy for adults to seek out children on the platform. The company notes in its announcement that parents will be able to monitor their kids' \"trusted connections\" via parental control features, and that the feature is intended only for people who teens already \"know and trust.\" Teens are only able to add trusted connections via their existing contacts list or a QR code.\n\"We believe chat without filters should only be accessible to users who have verified their age.\" the company writes in a blog post. \"This isn’t just about compliance; it’s about building engaging and appropriate digital spaces for everyone.\"\nWhile Roblox is notably not using the term \"age verification,\" the new feature comes at a time when there are increasing calls for social media companies and other platforms to check the ages of their youngest users. Reddit and Bluesky recently announced age verification features for users in the UK  — a change required of major platforms ahead of a new online safety law going into effect. Age verification mandates have also been gaining steam in the United States.\nA number of states have introduced age verification measures for social media, though laws in Arkansas and Utah have so far been blocked. Utah also recently passed a law requiring app stores to verify users' ages — an approach that has been endorsed by companies like Meta and Snap. And the Supreme Court recently upheld a Texas law that requires websites hosting adult to conduct age verification checks.\nRoblox, which unlike most online platforms allows children under 13 to have accounts, is in a slightly different position. And for now, it's billing its age checks as \"optional.\" But already having an age estimation feature in place could certainly be useful should it be required to take an even stricter approach in the future.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/roblox-is-adding-an-age-estimation-feature-for-teens-110047092.html?src=rss",

Some devices, like the Meta Quest 3, are entirely standalone, which means you don't need anything but the headset itself to use it. Other VR headsets need to be connected to a system from which it can draw power and run software. Some systems, like the HP Reverb G2, must connect to a PC, while others like the PS VR2 can connect to gaming consoles like the PS5. Most VR headsets come with the basic controllers you'll need to control actions and movement in virtual worlds. \nWhat's the difference between PC VR, Smartphone VR and Gaming Console VR?\nThe main difference between those three VR systems is the main machine that allows the VR headset to run. PC VR headsets require a PC, like a gaming laptop or desktop, to run, while smartphone and gaming console VR systems require smartphones and gaming consoles, respectively, to work.\nDo all VR headsets need a phone?\nNo, not all VR headsets need a phone to work. Many VR headsets have build in displays that sit in front of your eyes and basically act as your window into the virtual world.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/best-vr-accessories-150021126.html?src=rss",
