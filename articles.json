That’s a not-insignificant 32 percent off the usual $249 price of the noise-canceling in-ears.\nApple’s flagship AirPods were $100 off — a record-low $149 — during Prime Day, so we have seen them even cheaper than this, but for a non-sale period, Amazon’s current deal is worth considering. The AirPods Pro 2 are our top choice for iPhone users looking for wireless earbuds, thanks to much beefier sound than the original model, rock solid ANC and transparency modes, and seamless switching between Apple devices. \n \nThrow in spatial audio support, hands-free Siri and more than acceptable battery life, and the AirPods Pro 2 are hard to top. Not everyone gets on with the sometimes fiddly touch gestures, but a lot of wireless headphones struggle with this. If there’s anything to give you pause, it’s that we might be getting the AirPods Pro 3 sooner rather than later. But if that’s the case, you can be confident you’ll pay a lot more than $169 for the privilege.\nThe AirPods Pro aren’t the only discounted AirPods right now. The AirPods 4 (without ANC) are down to $99. Usually priced at $129, you’re saving $30 on a much improved entry-level AirPods offering. They fit and sound better than any non-Pro AirPods before them, and inherit some previously Pro-only features thanks to the H2 chip. If you travel a lot you’ll also certainly rue the lack of ANC, but if that isn’t a deal breaker for you, the sub-$100 price point might be tempting.\nCheck out our coverage of the best Apple deals for more discounts, and follow @EngadgetDeals on X for the latest tech deals and buying advice.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/apples-airpods-pro-2-drop-to-169-on-amazon-142401241.html?src=rss",

    "full_text": "Roku is launching an ad-free, subscription streaming service called Howdy. The service costs $2.99 per month and features a library of nearly 10,000 hours of content from its partners, including Lionsgate, Warner Bros. Discovery, and FilmRise, alongside select Roku Original titles. The company says subscribers will be able to watch titles like “Mad Max: Fury Road,” “The Blind Side,” “Weeds,” and “Kids in the Hall,” as well as rom-coms, medical dramas, ‘90s comedy, and the like. The move comes two months after Roku paid $185 million to acquire Frndly TV, a streaming service that offers live TV, on demand video and cloud-based DVR. Howdy joins the company’s Roku Channel, its free, ad-supported (FAST) streaming service. A recent report found that The Roku Channel is the most popular FAST service, ahead of competitors Tubi and Pluto TV. More than 125 million people use the platform every day, Roku says. A key growth driver for Howdy will be Roku’s organic reach — the company said earlier this year that it had surpassed 90 million streaming households. Roku last week reported its second-quarter financials, turning in better-than-expected revenue growth of 15%, as streaming hours on the platform came in at 35.4 billion, up 5.2 billion hours from a year earlier."

Don’t miss the 20th anniversary of TechCrunch Disrupt, and a chance to learn from the top voices in tech — grab your ticket now and save up to $675 before prices rise. This ability to simulate coherent, physically plausible environments over time makes Genie 3 much more than a generative model. Similarly, it’s still difficult to accurately model complex interactions between multiple independent agents in a shared environment. Genie 3 can also only support a few minutes of continuous interaction, when hours would be necessary for proper training. “We haven’t really had a Move 37 moment for embodied agents yet, where they can actually take novel actions in the real world,” Parker-Holder said, referring to the legendary moment in the 2016 game of Go between DeepMind’s AI agent AlphaGo and world champion Lee Sedol, in which Alpha Go played an unconventional and brilliant move that became symbolic of AI’s ability to discover new strategies beyond human understanding."

    "summary": "At start of December, Google DeepMind released Genie 2. The Genie family of AI systems are what are known as world models. They're capable of generating images as the user — either a human or, more likely, an automated AI agent — moves through the world the software is simulating. The resulting video of the model in action may look like a video game, but DeepMind has always positioned Genie 2 as a way to train other AI systems to be better at what they're designed to accomplish. With its new Genie 3 model, which the lab announced on Tuesday, DeepMind believes it has made an even better system for training AI agents.   \nAt first glance, the jump between Genie 2 and 3 isn't as dramatic as the one the model made last year. With Genie 2, DeepMind's system became capable of generating 3D worlds, and could accurately reconstruct part of the environment even after the user or an AI agent left it to explore other parts of the generated scene. Environmental consistency was often a weakness of prior world models. For instance, Decart's Oasis system had trouble remembering the layout of the Minecraft levels it would generate. \nBy comparison, the enhancements offered by Genie 3 seem more modest, but in a press briefing Google held ahead of today's official announcement, Shlomi Fruchter, research director at DeepMind, and Jack Parker-Holder, research scientist at DeepMind, argued they represent important stepping stones in the road toward artificial general intelligence.\nGoogle DeepMind\nSo what exactly does Genie 3 do better? To start, it outputs footage at 720p, instead of 360p like its predecessor. It's also capable of sustaining a \"consistent\" simulation for longer. Genie 2 had a theoretical limit of up to 60 seconds, but in practice the model would often start to hallucinate much earlier. By contrast, DeepMind says Genie 3 is capable of running for several minutes before it starts producing artifacts.\nAlso new to the model is a capability DeepMind calls \"promptable world events.\" Genie 2 was interactive insofar as the user or an AI agent was able to input movement commands and the model would respond after it had a few moments to generate the next frame. Genie 3 does this work in real-time. Moreover, it’s possible to tweak the simulation with text prompts that instruct Genie to alter the state of the world it’s generating. In a demo DeepMind showed, the model was told to insert a herd of deer into a scene of a person skiing down a mountain. The deer didn't move in the most realistic manner, but this is the killer feature of Genie 3, says DeepMind.\nGoogle DeepMind\nAs mentioned before, the lab primarily envisions the model as a tool for training and evaluating AI agents. DeepMind says Genie 3 could be used to teach AI systems to tackle \"what if\" scenarios that aren't covered by their pre-training. \"There are a lot of things that have to happen before a model can be deployed in the real world, but we do see it as a way to more efficiently train models and increase their reliability,\" said Fruchter, pointing to, for example, a scenario where Genie 3 could be used to teach a self-driving car how to safely avoid a pedestrian that walks in front of it.\nDespite the improvements DeepMind has made to Genie, the lab acknowledges there's much work to be done. For instance, the model can't generate real-world locations with perfect accuracy, and it struggles with text rendering. Moreover, for Genie to be truly useful, DeepMind believes the model needs to be able to sustain a simulated world for hours, not minutes. Still, the lab feels Genie is ready to make a real-world impact.\n\"We already at the point where you wouldn't use [Genie] as your sole training environment, but you can certainly finds things you wouldn't want agents to do because if they act unsafe in some settings, even if those settings aren't perfect, it's still good to know,\" said Parker-Holder. \"You can already see where this is going. It will get increasingly useful as the models get better.\"\nFor the time being, Genie 3 isn't available to the general public. However, DeepMind says it's working to make the model available to additional testers.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/google-deepminds-genie-3-can-dynamically-alter-the-state-of-its-simulated-worlds-140052124.html?src=rss",

    "full_text": "Though Spotify launched its audiobooks service in the U.S. back in 2022, household members on Duo and Family plans have long been left out. Through Spotify Premium, subscribers already have access to 15 hours of audiobook listening per month and can buy additional hours to top off that, as needed. This is made possible through the add-on called “Audiobooks+ for Plan Members.” Spotify CEO Daniel Ek pointed to a weaker ads business as the cause. (Spotify’s ads chief had just left for DoorDash, media outlets reported ahead of earnings.) In December, publisher HarperCollins teased a solution for the problem with household members’ inability to access audiobooks. HarperCollins CEO Brian Murray said at the time that Spotify was working to adjust a “technical problem” with family plans that limited audiobook streaming only to the family plan’s credit card holder. Last month, Spotify made good on that promise when it expanded audiobook access to plan members for the first time with the launch of Audibooks+ in several non-U.S. markets. Notably, that’s before these add-on plans became available. Spotify says it will experiment with other options for book fans in the future, including direct sales."

    "full_text": "Google DeepMind is releasing a new version of its AI “world” model, called Genie 3, capable of generating 3D environments that users and AI agents can interact with in real time. World models are a type of AI system that can simulate environments for purposes like education, entertainment, or to help train robots or AI agents. With world models, you give them a prompt and they generate a space that you can move around in like you would in a video game, but instead of the world being handcrafted with 3D assets, it’s all being generated with AI. It’s an area Google is putting a lot of effort into; the company showed off Genie 2 in December, which could create interactive worlds based off of an image, and it’s building a world models team led by a former co-lead of OpenAI’s Sora video generation tool. Genie 2 worlds were only playable up to a minute, for example. I recently tried “interactive video” from a company backed by Pixar’s cofounder, and it felt like walking through a blurry version of Google Street View where things morphed and changed in ways that I didn’t expect as I looked around. Genie 3 seems like it could be a notable step forward. The worlds will also have a 720p resolution and run at 24fps. DeepMind is adding what it calls “promptable world events” into Genie 3, too. There are also plenty of restrictions, like the limited ways users can interact with generated worlds and that legible text is “often only generated when provided in the input world description.” Google says it’s “exploring” how to bring Genie 3 to “additional testers” down the line."

    "summary": "Security researchers say they have evidence that ransomware gangs are hacking into large companies that rely on fully-patched SonicWall firewalls. The researchers say it's likely the flaw is a \"zero-day\" bug currently unknown to SonicWall.",
    "full_text": "Enterprise security company SonicWall is urging its customers to disable a core feature of its most recent line-up of firewall devices after security researchers reported an uptick in ransomware incidents targeting SonicWall customers. In a statement this week, SonicWall said it had observed a “notable increase” of security incidents targeting its Generation 7 firewalls where customers have its VPN enabled. The company said it is “actively investigating these incidents to determine whether they are connected to a previously disclosed vulnerability or if a new vulnerability may be responsible.” The company’s alert comes as security researchers say they have identified hackers targeting SonicWall devices to gain initial access to a victim’s network. Hackers are increasingly targeting enterprise products, like firewalls and VPNs, which work as digital gatekeepers, allowing legitimate employees access to the company’s network. But security flaws in these products can allow malicious hackers in, enabling attackers to launch data-stealing or destructive attacks. Security firm Arctic Wolf said it has seen intrusions targeting SonicWall customers as far back as mid-July. Huntress Labs, another cybersecurity firm, said it is “likely” that a zero-day bug in SonicWall firewalls is to blame for the attacks, and warned that the hackers exploiting the bug have been seen gaining access to a company’s domain controllers, which manages the devices and users on that network. In its blog, Huntress said it believes the Akira ransomware gang is behind some of the attacks targeting SonicWall customers. Akira has been known to target enterprise products, like Fortinet firewalls, to break into large networks."

    "full_text": "In Brief The U.S. government has added Google, OpenAI, and Anthropic to a list of approved vendors that can offer artificial intelligence services to civilian federal agencies, Bloomberg reports. The companies will see their AI tools offered via a new federal contracting platform, the Multiple Awards Schedule (MAS), which would let government agencies access AI tool vendors with pre-negotiated contracts, rather than negotiating with vendors individually. Bloomberg reports that the General Services Administration (GSA), which is in charge of the MAS, said the tech companies were assessed on the grounds of security and performance. The news comes in the wake of executive orders by President Donald Trump focused on AI development, including the adjustment of environmental standards to boost the supply of energy for data centers, as well as a directive for federal agencies to only use AI that’s “free from ideological bias.” This piece was updated to correct the abbreviation of the Multiple Awards Schedule."

Google is set to take the wraps off the latest additions to the Pixel lineup in just a couple of weeks, but some devices might not be available at launch. A new report from WinFuture suggests that Google is having “supply chain problems” that could push back the release of the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, Pixel Watch 4, and Pixel Buds 2a until October 9th, 2025. That means that, following the Made by Google event on August 20th, users may only be able to purchase the Pixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro, and Pixel 10 Pro XL. As noted by WinFuture, Google may start shipping the devices directly after the event, while availability in stores could start on August 28th. Leaks from other sources suggest that Google isn’t making any major price changes to its phone lineup. If recent rumors are true, the Pixel 10 Pro Fold could be completely dustproof, as well as have a slightly larger outer screen, thanks to a smaller gap between the cover display and hinge. There have been fewer leaks about Google’s upcoming wearables, but the Pixel Buds 2a might come in a new “iris” color, while the Watch 4 may sport a thicker design. Google may be preparing a few upgrades to the rest of its Pixel lineup as well, including adding a third camera to the base Pixel 10 and adding wireless Qi2 charging across all of its new phones."

This week on The Vergecast, guest host Mia Sato talks to YouTube fitness pioneer Cassey Ho (better known as Blogilates) about the well-oiled machine that is the dupe economy. Ho shares her experience creating her own line of athletic wear that sooner or later gets ripped off by countless copycats — and how she tries to fight back. Then, Mia brings an audio diary from a visit to Fabscrap, a textile recycling facility in New York that is working to save fabric and other materials from landfills. Fashion is a wasteful industry, not unlike tech — but luckily, there are people like the Fabscrap staff and volunteers who are working toward solutions.

    "summary": "The new Pantone Ice Melt model will go on sale in a $1,000 bundle that includes the Moto Buds Loop in the same color.",
    "full_text": "After teasing a new Motorola and Swarovski collaboration a few weeks ago, the companies on Tuesday are debuting new editions of the Razr phone and the Moto Buds Loop that are adorned with crystals. The phone and the earbuds are being sold in a $1,000 bundle called The Brilliant Collection, which features both devices in their new Pantone Ice Melt models. Motorola says that this edition of the Razr will have a leather-inspired finish that includes 35 Swarovski crystals, including one larger crystal with 26 facets on its hinge. The included Moto Buds Loop -- which previously launched with a French Oak color model that also features Swarovski crystals -- have a similar Ice Melt shade to match up with the phone. The Razr normally costs $700 and the Moto Buds Loop are $300, so if you were intent on getting both devices anyway then getting them in this collection is the same price while getting the crystals. However, Motorola also happens to be running a sale on the 2025 Razr line at the time of this announcement, marking down the non-Ice Melt models to $600. The Brilliant Collection bundle is the latest expansion of materials that Motorola has been bringing to its phones, which on its $1,300 Razr Ultra also include wood and Alcantara fabric. Considering how the Ultra is already making use of those materials as a selling point, I'm surprised that the lower-cost Razr is first to debut a model that features crystals. But it could be a matter of time before the Razr Ultra gets its own Swarovski collaboration, and Motorola isn't alone right now in providing a stylish refresh on its foldable phone line. Case in point, this launch comes a few weeks after rival Samsung launched its own line of foldable phones, including the redesigned $2,000 Galaxy Z Fold 7, the $1,100 Galaxy Z Flip 7 and the $900 Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE."

While the latter already has more than 8,000 satellites in orbit, providing service to more than 100 countries, Project Kuiper is barely out of the gate by comparison, with 78 satellites launched to date. Amazon’s next launch is scheduled for August 7th as it continues to build a planned constellation of 3,236 satellites. The NBN Co partnership may not be the first Project Kuiper service to launch, however. Amazon’s website says it expects to begin “delivering service to customers in late 2025,” though the company hasn’t yet revealed where, or how much the service and consumer hardware will cost."

Liquid Glass is what Apple calls its new visual language, so it's not quite clear whether the Android iteration of the app will ever get the same visual overhaul. It did get a handful of elements from the iOS 26 version, though, including new pill-shaped buttons for play, shuffle and repeat at the top of albums, playlists and tracks on queue to replace the rectangular buttons with rounded corners. \nUsers will also apparently be able to pin music to the top of their Library. They can pin artists, whole albums, playlists or just specific songs for easy access if they want, and they can set anything they pin to be automatically downloaded to their device. 9to5Google says anything they pin will  be synced with their Music app for iOS, but they can easily unpin things by long-pressing on them in the Library. \nThe Android app will also come with \"lyrics translation and pronunciation guide,\" which is powered by Apple Intelligence on iPhones. If it is the same live translation feature, it will presumably be powered by Google's own AI on Android. Users will also be able to get their monthly and yearly replay stats within the app. Unfortunately, there's no confirmation that AutoMix, the big addition to the app for iOS 26 and the more advanced version of crossfade, is coming to Android.

PlayStation Plus is Sony's version of Xbox Game Pass, and it offers subscribers a large, constantly expanding library of games. Here are the games all PS Plus subscribers can play throughout August. This is a macabre soulslike game akin to Bloodborne and based on Carlo Collodi's classic tale, The Adventures of Pinocchio. Puppets have torn the city of Krat apart, and you play as Pinocchio as he searches for Geppetto in the grisly, oil-stained city. You'll encounter traps, twisted contraptions and maniacal humans in your search throughout the city, and maybe you'll find what it means to be human along the way. DayZ places you and dozens of other players into a dense 163 square-kilometer (about 63 square-mile) map filled with zombies and materials you'll need to last. And with no checkpoints or saves, you'll need to work together; otherwise, you'll have to start all over. You'll use your characters' Quirks -- or unique powers -- to overcome your opponent's abilities and win these epic clashes. For more on PlayStation Plus, here's what to know about the service and a rundown of PS Plus Extra and Premium games added in July."

I tried Lee’s example of setting a reminder to pack an umbrella 10 minutes before rain. It doesn’t help that generative AI can be so open-ended and unpredictable compared to voice assistants. Their stricter limitations make them easier to learn, even if they can be fairly frustrating. Conversely, tech CEOs keep telling us that they can’t wait to see what use cases we come up with for generative AI. The unpredictability of generative AI also means you can ask for one thing (a reminder to carry an umbrella) and end up with a result you didn’t want (Gemini declining because it’s sunny). You can’t just give them a new tool and say, “Have at it!” That’s like giving someone a bucket of Legos and telling them to build the Millennium Falcon from memory.

No matter which VPN you use on Android or any other device, the bare minimum for consideration is that it protects your privacy. These protocols have received intense scrutiny from the open-source community and are trusted by thousands of enterprises worldwide, so you can trust them to keep your data private. Independent audits are one of the best ways to assess whether or not a VPN provider is truly invested in keeping your data private. Additional privacy features to look out for include Tor over VPN capabilities for an extra layer of privacy, ad and tracker blockers and multihop connections, which encrypt your traffic twice through two separate VPN servers rather than just one. A good Android VPN should run smoothly and be easy to use regardless of your technical expertise. Be careful with free VPNs because you may end up putting your privacy at risk instead of protecting it. Unfortunately, it’s very hard to confirm whether most of them have sensible no-logs policies. In the very worst cases, they’re just spyware apps masquerading as VPNs that hackers use to scoop up your passwords and bank account details for identity theft attacks. While VPNs are privacy tools first and foremost, they're also great for unblocking geo-restricted streaming content."

Built by Samsung, it will act as a starting vision for where Google's AR/VR next products could be headed. Meta often comes out with hardware surprises around Connect, its September developer conference that I attend every year. Meta's Ray-Bans have been a hot seller, with partner EssilorLuxottica reporting tripled revenue growth for smart glasses in the last year. Meta could get a foot in the door on neural tech by releasing this band now and finessing it over time. A year ago, Meta announced hardware partners that were supposed to make additional Horizon OS Quest-alikes sometime soon. Apple hasn't announced any plans for Visual Intelligence on Vision Pro yet, but maybe the hardware pieces will start falling into place this year. It would make sense, but Valve may not have a new Steam Deck for at least another year or more. Smart glasses could be the first wave of AI, and next-gen mixed reality headsets after that."

In contrast to rival generative AI video tools like Google’s Veo and OpenAI’s Sora, which try to block users from generating anything seedy, the Grok chatbot’s Imagine feature provides a “Spicy” generation mode that actively directs it to spit out nudity and sexualized content. Grok Imagine includes text-to-image capabilities that allow users to generate pictures based on descriptions, or an image-to-video tool to make short clips, complete with audio effects like Google’s Veo 3 model. Musk describes Grok Imagine as “AI Vine,” a platform that he has long expressed interest in resurrecting. X users have already published their Grok Imagine experiments, with some of the “Spicy” options depicting photorealistic women flashing their breasts and genitals, and bikini-clad anime waifus sexily dancing against SpaceX rockets. More than 34 million images have been generated using the tool since Monday, according to Musk. TechCrunch found in its own testing that Grok Imagine’s image capabilities have some restrictions around generating celebrity photos. We’ve not yet been able to test if the tool’s Spicy mode will undress images of real women that are uploaded as reference materials. Imagine is available for SuperGrok and Premium Plus X subscribers via Grok’s iOS app. The tool has also started to roll out in early access for Grok’s Android app, but users are reporting that it’s currently limited to making images and lacks the video generation feature."

That means the update might be buggy for you, and your device's battery life may be affected, so it's best to keep those troubles off your primary device. If you want to try out the beta, I recommend downloading it on a secondary device. Here's what you should know about each of these options and which one is right for most people. Choosing Never allows calls from unsaved numbers to come through and ring on your phone. You can also pick Silence, which is the nuclear option for phone calls. Any unsaved number that calls you will be silenced and go to voicemail, no questions asked. If you do choose Ask Reason for Calling and don't like it, you can always follow the above steps again and choose one of the other options.

    "full_text": "With both, you get 50GB of fast Premium 5G data (depending on the network capabilities in your area), which drops to 3G speeds of still-unlimited data after that allotment is used up. You can use your phone as a mobile hotspot with unlimited data, but only at 3G speeds and restricted to paltry 2G speeds when you're in Canada or Mexico. The Essentials plan also doesn't include perks such as streaming video from Netflix or Apple TV Plus, nor the five-year price guarantee found on the Experience More and Experience Beyond plans. T-Satellite service is also not included, though it can be added for $10 a month when it launches on July 23. Where Essentials comes out ahead of Essentials Saver is the number of lines you can have on your account. However, if you need just one or two lines, Essentials Saver is still the better deal. A single line on Saver costs $50 a month, compared with $60 for the same features on Essentials, and two lines on Saver cost $80 a month, compared with $90 for Essentials. You get a solid level of basic phone service, with unlimited calls, texts and data, 50GB of premium higher-speed data and better pricing than the Essentials Saver plan for three or more lines (up to six). Essentials is great for a cost-conscious family of three or more that wants unlimited everything, even at some slower speeds. This plan isn’t for people who want features such as larger amounts of premium data, regular hotspot access or included perks, or folks who need to set up a family or group with three or more lines."

    "summary": "It’s impressive what tablets and ultraportable laptops can do. But to get the most functionality out of them, you may want a few more ports at your disposal, which is where a USB-C hub comes into play. By connecting to just one port, these handy devices give you extra USB connections, HDMI slots, SD card readers and Ethernet jacks. Plus most offer pass-through charging so you can keep your tablet powered while you work with all your peripherals hooked up. We tested more than a dozen models to come up with a few great picks for different situations and users. Here are the best USB-C hubs based on our testing.\nTable of contents\n\nBest USB-C hubs for 2025\nWhat to look for in a USB-C hub\nHow we test USB-C hubs\nOther hubs we tested \nRecent updates\n\nBest USB-C hubs for 2025\n \n \n \n \nWhat to look for in a USB-C hub\nHub vs docking station\nThe first thing to decide is whether you need a USB-C hub or a USB-C docking station. There’s no set standard for what differentiates the two, but docking stations tend to have more ports, offer a separate DC power adapter and cost more, with some reaching upwards of $400. We have a separate guide to the best docking stations to check out if you’re looking for something bigger than what we’re discussing here. USB-C hubs, in contrast, have between four and 10 ports, can support pass-through charging and typically cost between $30 and $150. \nHubs, sometimes also called dongles or even multiport adapters, make more sense for smaller setups with just a few peripherals, such as a monitor, a wired keyboard and mouse, and the occasional external drive. They’re also more portable, since they’re small and require no dedicated power. That could be useful if you change work locations but want to bring your accessories with you, or if you want to replace your laptop with a more powerful tablet. A docking station or Thunderbolt dock makes more sense for someone who needs a robust setup for their laptop, including multiple external monitors, webcams, stream decks, microphones and so on.\nBoth docks and hubs make it easy to grab your laptop off your desk for a meeting or other brief relocation and when you get back, you only need to plug in one cable to get all your accessories reconnected. Of course, if you just need to plug in one peripheral, you may not need a hub or a dock, a simple USB-C adapter, like HDMI to USB-C or USB-A to USB-C, may do the trick.\nPorts\nFor a USB-C hub to work, it needs to connect to a port on your laptop or tablet that supports video, data and power — all of which is covered by anything listed as USB 3.0 or better, including USB4 and Thunderbolt 3 and Thunderbolt 4. The port, of course, needs to be Type-C as well. The sea of laptops out there is vast, so it’s hard to make generalizations, but modern laptops, including Windows and Apple models, should have at least one USB-C port that will suffice, and indeed, every one of our top picks for the best laptops do — including our top pick, the M4 MacBook Air.\nNext, it’s a matter of finding a good USB-C hub that has the right connections for your needs. Most hubs offer some combo of HDMI, USB, SD card reader, Ethernet and 3.5 mm ports. If you have a 4K monitor and would like at least a 60Hz refresh rate, you’ll need a hub with an HDMI 2.0 port — HDMI 1.4 only goes up to 30Hz. HDMI 2.1 will handle 4K at up to 120Hz, but hubs that have adopted that standard aren’t as common just yet. Keep in mind that a low refresh rate can cause your screen to feel laggy, making your mouse appear glitchy and your webcam movements to look delayed.\nAdditional USB ports on these accessories are usually USB Type-A or USB Type-C. They can support data with different transfer rates, typically 5Gbps or 10Gbps. Some ports only handle passthrough power and no data, and some can do data, power and video, so it’s best to check the spec list to make sure you’re getting the support you need. Keep in mind that a hub may bill itself as a 7-in-1, but one of those ports may not be usable for anything other than charging.\nStandard SD and microSD cards are useful for transferring data from cameras and the like or for offloading files from your hard drive, and many hubs have those slots. Ethernet ports may deliver faster internet speeds than your Wi-Fi and a hub with a 3.5mm jack can bring back the wired headphone connection that some laptops have ditched.\n\n\n\n\nPower delivery\nNearly all of the USB-C hubs I tested support passthrough charging. That means if your laptop or tablet only charges via USB, you don’t have to take up another port on your laptop to keep everything topped up. Unlike a docking station, powering a hub is optional. The one exception is if you want to close the lid on your laptop while you work on an external monitor. Most computers will go into sleep mode if the lid is closed without power, so either the laptop or the hub will need to be plugged into the wall to prevent that from happening.\nMany of the newer hubs include a 100W USB-C power delivery (PD) port, with a healthy 80 to 85 watts going to your Mac, PC, iPad or Android tablet (the hubs take a little of the juice for themselves, hence the 15-watt or so difference). In my tests, a powered USB hub ran hotter than when it wasn't passing the charge through, so I prefer to power the computer directly using its own charger. But for tablets or other devices with no extra ports, that PD option is important.\nSome PD ports are also data ports — which is both good and bad. On one hand, it feels wasteful to use a perfectly good data port just for boring old electricity. But on the other hand, USB-C connections that only carry a charge are less versatile, and it makes it seem like it has more accessory hookups than it actually does.\nDesign\nThere’s surprisingly little design variation among hubs. Most look like a flat slab, a little smaller than a smartphone, and have an attached Type-C host cable. The hues range from a silvery black to a silvery gray. Some are thinner than others, some have all ports on one edge and some have ports on both sides. All of this is just to say that aesthetics probably won’t make or break your buying decision.\nOne variation that could tip the scales is the length of the cable. A longer one will give you more freedom as you arrange the hub on your desk, potentially even letting you hide it behind your laptop. Or you may prefer a shorter one to keep the hub neatly set beside your laptop.\nHow we test USB-C hubs\nBefore we test anything, we take a look at what’s available and how they’ve been received by shoppers, forum-goers and other publications. I became familiar with a few reputable brands when I was testing docking stations, so I looked into hubs from those companies as well. I focused on items that would help with an average day of productivity — not high-end setups or demanding gaming situations. Once I settled on a dozen or so that would make good candidates, I had them shipped to my humble office in the desert and started testing them out over the course of a few weeks.\nI used an M1 MacBook Pro running MacOS Sonoma as the host computer and plugged in accessories that include a 4K Dell monitor, a ZSA USB-C ergo keyboard, a Logitech USB-A gaming mouse, an Elgato USB-C 4K webcam, a Logitech streaming light, a USB-A 3.0 Sandisk thumb drive, a USB-C Samsung T7 Shield external drive and a pair of wired headphones I got for free on an airplane (I should probably invest in some wired headphones, but the cord dangling on my chest drives me nutty so all my earbuds are wireless). I used high-end HDMI and USB-C cables to ensure that any data or connectivity issues weren’t related to my equipment.\nThen I put each USB-C hub through a gamut of basic tests. I looked at what could be plugged in at once, the resolution on the monitor, data transfer speeds, the overall build quality of the hub and general usability factors, like the placement of the ports and the length of the cords. And, finally, the price-to-value ratio helped determine the best ones for a few different use cases.\nOther hubs we tested\nHyperDrive Next 10 Port USB-C Hub\nThere’s a lot to like about HyperDrive’s Next 10 Port USB-C Hub. The tethered cable is a lavish 13 inches long, the HDMI 2.0 port outputs clear and crisp 4K visuals at 60Hz and the high-speed data transfers are great. It has the coveted two USB-C data ports plus a PD port, and there’s even a headphone jack. The only thing that holds back a full-throated endorsement is the way our unit handled a streaming light. Having it on at full brightness made the webcam flicker every time. The issue went away at 75 percent brightness, but the same problem didn’t happen on any other hub I tested.\nAnker 341 USB-C Hub (7-in-1)\nThere’s nothing wrong with the Anker 341 USB-C hub. In fact it’s a current recommendation in our iPad accessories guide and it comes at a great $35 price. It gives you two USB-A ports as well as SD slots. But at this point, a 1.4 HDMI connection, which only supports 4K resolution at 30Hz feels a little retro. There’s also just a single USB-C downstream port and the data transfer tests proved to be a touch slower than the other hubs. But if you’ve got a lower resolution monitor and don’t need more than one USB-C, you won’t be disappointed with it.\nAnker 555 8-in-1\nIt was a tough call between the UGreen Revodoc Pro 109 and the Anker 555 8-in-1 for our top recommendation. Both have a similar port array with an HDMI, Ethernet, two USB Type A, a PD USB-C and a USB-C 3.2 on the 555. And the Anker USB-C hub is $15 cheaper. We went with the UGreen hub for its more premium build, extra USB-A port and longer cord that gives you two extra inches to work with. But if you want to save a few bucks this hub is a worthwhile pick. \nStartech 4-Port USB-C Hub (data only)\nI only became aware of Startech when I started researching for this guide. The quality is decent and the yellow accents are a welcome bit of color in the otherwise very gray world of hubs. The performance is solid, with no hiccups that I encountered. The brand’s 4-Port USB-C Hub has a long cord that wraps around the hub itself, which is unique. It doesn’t bother with power delivery, which isn’t an issue if you can power your computer directly. But the four USB ports (three Type-A and one Type-C) max out at 5Gbps and there’s no HDMI connector. It goes for $46, and unfortunately for it, there are cheaper ways to get a few more USB ports for your setup.\nRecent updates\nAugust 2025: Updated to ensure our top picks are still current and accurate.\nApril 2025: Added our experience with the Anker 555 8-in-1 hub to the Other hubs we tested section.  This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-usb-c-hub-120051833.html?src=rss",
    "full_text": "Those spring-loaded ejectors never work on the first try for me, so this is a more elegant solution. There’s just one usable downstream USB-C port; the other is only capable of delivering power to your device. If you'd prefer a DisplayPort connection and don't need the data card slots, check out UGreen's 8-in-1 Revodok hub. They have a pretty similar port array and the Anker USB-C hub is $15 cheaper. Ultimately, its shorter tethered cable and single USB-C port that either delivers power or runs a peripheral led me to prefer Wavlink’s model. The EZQuest Slim Gen 2 hub gives you not just one or two usable Type-C ports, but five of them. That price bump does get you a few features that most hubs don’t have, namely the option of three USB-C ports (one port can be used for either power delivery or accessory support) and dual extended displays with an Apple MacBook (after you download the SiliconMotion driver). On one hand, it feels wasteful to use a perfectly good data port just for boring old electricity. All of this is just to say that aesthetics probably won’t make or break your buying decision. I focused on items that would help with an average day of productivity — not high-end setups or demanding gaming situations."

In the U.S., \"5–35°C\" would be approximately 41–55°F. Nintendo of America didn't immediately respond to a request for comment about the tweet. When the console gets too hot, a message will pop up advising that the system is overheating, and it will immediately go into sleep mode to cool it off. So far, it's unclear what is causing the console to overheat. Other times, owners said it happened in handheld mode. Back in 2022, Nintendo confirmed that the original Switch also had a tendency to overheat."

Other upgrades include an added depth and water temperature sensor, as well as a new FDA-cleared sleep apnea detection feature, the latter of which is also available on the last-gen Series 9 and Ultra 2. The Apple Watch SE received a refresh in late 2022. Those omissions might take this out of the running for some people, but it still may be exactly what you’re after. Best of all, it starts at $249 for the 40mm Wi-Fi / GPS model, which is $30 less than the previous generation’s baseline cost. While all of the Apple Watch models and colorways covered here are encased in aluminum (except the Ultra 2, which has a titanium build), Apple does make a more premium range built out of stainless steel and titanium. However, they start at much steeper prices of $699 and above."

But a vacuum with at least 120 minutes of runtime (180 is ideal) will clean the whole house in one go. For around $300, the Tapo RV30 Max Plus is a very capable robot vacuum and mop with some key features usually only found on vacuums that are more than twice its price. It left some of the finer dust and debris, as its single bristle / rubber brush isn’t super effective. You can even set the cleaning direction and build up to four maps — again, features usually only found on higher-end robots. The Narwal can use disposal dustbins that compress dirt, so you don’t have to empty it as often. The lack of a camera also means its navigation is spotty, and sending it to clean specific rooms wasn’t always successful. It also has heated mop drying to help prevent the base from getting stinky — a first in this price range. Their dual rubber roller brushes rotate in opposite directions to effectively dig up dirt from carpets, and they are by far the best at tackling pet hair on all surfaces. Overall, it’s a good-looking robot that vacuums really well and is smart enough to get the job done with limited intervention."

The Perseids meteor shower is about to give you a real light show, provided you're far enough away from light pollution to see it. The show started on July 17, and will run through Aug. 23. During its peak, the meteor shower is known to rain down as many as 100 meteors per hour, according to the American Meteor Society. Per NASA, fireballs tend to last longer than standard shooting stars and can come in a variety of different colors. Until then, it leaves behind an excellent tail of dust and debris to feed us yearly meteor showers. During this time, the shower will produce anywhere from 25 to 100 meteors per hour on average. Thus, if you're planning on watching this year's Perseids during their peak, you'll want to get out of the city and suburbs as far as possible. Like all meteors, Perseids are named after the constellation from which they appear. Thus, it is highly probable that light pollution from the moon may reduce the number of visible meteors by a hefty margin, depending on how things go."

Nero (Fiennes) spends a good portion of the movie reliving memories of his failed relationship with the singer Faith (played by actress-turned-rocker Juliette Lewis). Despite being 30 years old, Strange Days' special effects hold up incredibly well. Where other 1995 sci-fi flicks like Hackers and Johnny Mnemonic experimented with early computer-generated imagery, Strange Days went for a more practical approach: Characters shift in and out of the Playback footage with a simple analog distortion effect, just like you'd find while watching home videos on VHS tapes. Rapper Jeriko One (played by Glenn Plummer) delivers biting social commentary in his music video. And contemporary artists Aphex Twin, Deee-Lite and Skunk Anansie perform during the movie's bombastic final act, a New Year's Eve rave in downtown LA. Still, I'm glad this sci-fi masterpiece is available to stream today."

Your therapist has to keep your conversations private, but OpenAI doesn't have the same responsibility or right to protect that information in a lawsuit, as CEO Sam Altman acknowledged recently. ChatGPT users can expect to see a notification like this if they're chatting with the app for long stretches of time. Tools like ChatGPT can encourage delusions because they tend to affirm what people believe and don't challenge the user's interpretation of reality. OpenAI used the example of \"should I break up with my boyfriend?\" You may be annoyed by an interruption to your workflow caused by something asking if you need a break, but it may give someone who needs it a push to go touch grass. Lembke said you should watch your time when using something like a chatbot."

    "summary": "After seeing the changes coming with iOS 26, we're ready to finally see Apple's newest collection of smartphones: the iPhone 17 lineup. While that's still more than a month away — assuming Apple sticks to its usual release schedule — we haven't been left completely in the dark about what the new phones will look like. As with most unreleased iPhone models,  rumors and leaks have trickled in about the hardware side ahead of the official introduction. Here's what we're expecting and what we can reasonably assume we'll get from Cupertino in September.\nWhat are the latest iPhone 17 rumors and reports?\nAgain, not all iPhone rumors are created equal, and all should be taken with a grain of salt. The latest comes from a MacRumors report which says the internal battery pack of the new superthin iPhone Air (see below) is just 2.49mm thick — half the thickness of the iPhone 17 Pro battery. The leak was posted on the Korean-langauge Naver blog, where they show the alleged batteries of the iPhone 17 Air and 17 Pro side by side. The same account claimed the 17 Air's battery capacity was a mere 2,800 mAh, MacRumors notes. (That's below the battery capacity of current iPhone 16 models.) \nWhen will the iPhone 17 series be announced?\nMost years, the flagship smartphones are introduced in September. It's a little early to have the specific dates; some years, Apple only gives a week or two of lead time between sending invites and hosting the event. But years of past precedent show that sometime in September should be when the 17 models make their debut. This family of smartphones may be the last to follow that trend, however. There have been hints that the introduction of the iPhone 18 collection in 2026 will be split into a pro-tier announcement in the fall and a standard model announcement the following spring.\nWhat will the new iPhone 17 lineup include?\nDesign leaks suggest that Apple is building an ultra-thin smartphone, likely to be named the iPhone 17 Air to match Apple's ultralight laptop designation. Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, often a solid source of advanced intel about Apple, reported in January that the iPhone 17 Air will be equipped with a basic A19 chip and will only have a single camera lens. It may also use Apple's new in-house modem, which was introduced in February on the iPhone 16e. More details about this development may leak ahead of September, but that's what we know for now.\nAn investor note from Apple analyst Jeff Pu indicated that the Air will have a titanium frame. If his reports are accurate, the lightweight smartphone will be the only entry in the iPhone 17 lineup to use that metal; the iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone 17 Pro Max are expected to be made of aluminum, which is oddly a lighter material than titanium. Other speculation had suggested that the Air would use a blend of aluminum and titanium, so the exact materials may not be known until the official announcement.\nEach new roster includes a base model, but over the years, Apple shakes up the variety of phones it offers. Most likely there will be an iPhone 17 and an iPhone 17 Pro. Apple has also committed to the size matters philosophy, and has been building an iPhone Pro Max option with an even bigger screen and better battery life; the 17 roster will almost certainly have one as well. \nThe new Pro iPhones are said to have a full-width \"camera island\" on the rear, which would mark the first time an Apple model opted for that design. This feature can be seen in the the purported iPhone 17 \"spotted in the wild.\" The pics, highlighted on MacRumors, show a black cased iPhone (17 Pro?) with the distinct back panel. Is it the real deal? The dual angles lend a degree of credibility in a social media landscape increasingly polluted with AI-enhanced fakes, but your guess is as good as ours.\nI just spotted a test development iPhone in the wild 🤩🤩🤩 pic.twitter.com/iS3PtKWqxJ— Fox Pupy 🦊🧡 (@Skyfops) July 28, 2025\n\nThe iPhone 17 Air seems primed to take the place of a potential iPhone 17 Plus. Since the iPhone 16e was only just introduced in February at a surprisingly high price point, it seems unlikely that there will be a new addition to that lower end of the spectrum, the models that were previously called SE. \nAt the very least, it sounds like the iPhone 17 Air won't take away the charging port and rely only on wireless connectivity. Bloomberg said that while Apple had investigated making the iPhone 17 Air without a single port, the company (fortunately) changed plans. He also says that the rumored phone will have a 6.6-inch screen and include the Dynamic Island and Camera Control button. Finally, the price is rumored at $900 — likely more than the standard iPhone 17 but less than the Pro.\nWe've also gotten what seems to be a reliable look at what the color lineup will be for the new smartphones. Macworld reported that the iPhone 17 will be available in black, white, steel gray, green, purple and light blue. The iPhone 17 Air will reportedly have four color options: black, white, light blue and light gold. While the Air colors will be less saturated, the visuals for the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max will go bold. The options for the Pro models are expected to be black, white, gray, dark blue and orange.\nOn July 30, Tom's Guide highlighted an X post from Sonny Dickson — a longtime and generally reliable leaker of unreleased iPhone information — showing \"dummy\" iPhone 17 models in the new colors that were the source of the aforementioned Macworld story. While these are literally just mock-ups — not real, leaked iPhones — it's interesting to see how the design and color rumors translate into a real-world look and feel.\nWhat will iOS 26 be like?\nApple upended its numbering conventions with WWDC 2025, and will match the name of each new operating system to the year it's released. So when the next wave of iPhones hits, they'll be running on iOS 26.\nOn the design side, the smartphone OS introduced during the big developer showcase took a contentious approach dubbed Liquid Glass. Apple has been scaling down the amount of transparency effects in the subsequent beta tests of iOS 26, but it will still have a glass-like visual.\nThe feature list includes big and small updates. On the more impactful side, the Phone and Photos apps have been redesigned. There will be several features leveraging artificial intelligence, such as live translation capabilities coming to Phone, FaceTime and Messages. Apple is also currently testing a sensitive content warning for child accounts that will freeze FaceTime video if nudity is detected by on-device machine learning tools. And the company is also launching Visual Intelligence, which will use AI to search for elements in an image.\niOS 26 also has a litany of minor, quality of life improvements. Group texts are getting support for polls. And for the slow risers out there, iOS 26 will finally let you escape the tyranny of the nine minute snooze alarm. \nThe next iOS is now available as a public beta. Here are our initial impressions of the Liquid Glass design and other new features. iOS 26 is compatible with all models back through iPhone 11.\nUpdate, August 4, 2025, 5:23PM ET: Added latest battery leaks about the iPhone 17 models.\nUpdate, August 1, 2025, 8:15AM ET: Added new photos showing potential iPhone 17 colors.\nUpdate, July 30, 2025, 11:08AM ET: Added latest leaks and rumors about the iPhone 17, and updated information on the iOS 26 public beta.\nUpdate, July 17, 2025, 4:40PM ET: Added latest information about iOS 26, possible materials for the Air, and the color options for the different models.\nUpdate, March 17, 2025, 2PM ET: Added details about the rumored price and features of the iPhone 17 Air.\nUpdate, April 11, 2025, 3:45PM ET: Added details from Front Page Tech's new video that claims to reveal details from a leaked iOS 19 build.\nKatie Teague contributed to this story.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/iphone-17-pro-max-and-air-release-dates-colors-and-everything-else-you-need-to-know-about-apples-new-phones-153024847.html?src=rss",

I just spotted a test development iPhone in the wild 🤩🤩🤩 pic.twitter.com/iS3PtKWqxJ — Fox Pupy 🦊🧡 (@Skyfops) July 28, 2025 So when the next wave of iPhones hits, they'll be running on iOS 26. And the company is also launching Visual Intelligence, which will use AI to search for elements in an image. Here are our initial impressions of the Liquid Glass design and other new features."

If you do, trawl the user reviews and comments for people's experiences with upgrading a particular model. Here are our recommendations if you're looking for the best gaming laptop under $1,000. If you like to live on the bleeding edge, cloud gaming services such as Nvidia GeForce Now and Microsoft Xbox Game Pass Ultimate's Cloud Gaming will let you play games on laptops with specs that hit the under-$500 mark. Since Chromebooks are cloud-first devices, you don't need a lot of storage built-in. A frequent complaint we see is about \"washed-out\" looking displays with poor viewing angles. If you need to go with a smaller drive -- they tend to max out at 256GB in this price range -- you can always add an external drive or two (or five, for some of us) at some point down the road or use cloud storage to bolster a small internal drive. For memory, we highly recommend 16GB of RAM (8GB absolute minimum). RAM is where the operating system stores all the data for currently running applications, and it can fill up fast (for example, right now Chrome is taking up 7GB of my memory). Some PC makers will solder memory on and also leave an empty internal slot for adding a stick of RAM."

The final 50,000 folds will air via a live stream later Monday. The video features an on-screen counter which is linked to a sensor that's taped to the Z Fold 7's inner display. Phones from companies such as Samsung, Apple, Motorola and Google all go through simulated durability testing. In the case of folding phones, machines will open and close phones thousands of times to see how they might hold up in the real world. Given that foldable phones have complex hinge designs and flexible displays, they are more prone to damage or failure than regular slab-style phones. Durability is actually one major reason, along with battery life, that some consumers aren't jumping into the folding phone world."

    "summary": "Liquid Glass is a huge new change coming to iOS 26. (Apple)\nYou've seen all the changes coming to your iPhone and now you're desperately ready to upgrade to iOS 26 — but it's only August and the operating system won't be here until this fall. But I have good news: you can test out all the features now by downloading and installing Apple's public beta, which CEO Tim Cook says is (along with the other current beta operating systems) \"by far the most popular developer betas we’ve had,\" 9to5Mac reports. You can also take a look at our preview of the iOS 26 public beta release, which shows off the fresh home and lock screen redesign. Called Liquid Glass, the new translucent look will extend across all of Apple's upcoming operating systems. The overhaul is one of several big changes coming to iOS, macOS, iPadOS and the rest of Apple's software suite, all of which were showcased during the company's WWDC keynote on June 9. \nAfter overpromising on AI plans last year, Apple kept its iOS roadmap focused more on basic quality of life improvements this year. There are multiple useful additions coming to the Phone and Messages apps on your iPhone, for instance: Apple execs outlined the ability to weed out spam texts or other unknown senders and an option to hold your spot on a phone call when you've been waiting for a representative to pick up. Plus, a treasured feature that we took for granted is coming back (hint: it's in the Photos app).\nSiri, meanwhile, is in a holding pattern. Apple has previously specified that its smarter voice assistant — first promised at WWDC 2024 — is delayed until some point \"in the coming year,\" so you shouldn't expect any major changes in the current betas. But there are reports that Apple is aiming to give Siri a bigger brain transplant by basing it on third-party artificial intelligence models like OpenAI's ChatGPT or Anthropic's Claude, which could make 2026 a pivotal year. The company is also reportedly working on a 'stripped-down' AI chatbot to rival ChatGPT.\nWith each beta, it seems like additional new improvements are popping up, like this FaceTime feature that'll freeze your video if it detects nudity. Most newer iPhone models are eligible to download iOS 26 (both the betas and final version). Want to see the full list of new features coming this fall? Read on.  \nWhat is iOS 26?\nThe current iPhone operating system is iOS 18, and Apple is still actively updating it — version 18.6 was just recently released. But don't expect to see iOS 19. Instead, Apple is skipping the numbering ahead to iOS 26 later this year. The company has decided to line up its iOS version numbers with a year-based system, similar to car model years. So while iOS and its sibling operating systems will be released in late 2025, they're all designated \"26\" to reflect the year ahead. (Meanwhile, iOS 18 is still getting new versions this summer, too.)\nIt's official, we're moving to iOS 26. (Apple)\nWhat is Liquid Glass design?\nLet's be honest. Out of everything announced at WWDC this year, the new Liquid Glass design was the star of the show. The iPhone's home and lock screens have looked pretty much the same year after year — the last exciting thing (in my opinion) was the option to add your own aesthetic to your home screen by customizing your apps and widgets. So seeing the home and lock screens' new facelift is refreshing.\nSo what exactly is Liquid Glass? Apple calls it a \"new translucent material\" since, well, the apps and widgets are clear. However, the screen can still adapt to dark and light modes, depending on surroundings. You'll also notice buttons with a new floating design in several apps, like Phone and Maps. They're designed to be less distracting than the current buttons, but are still easy to see. While the design overhaul has proven to be controversial since its announcement, some — including Engadget's own Devindra Hardawar — like the new direction, even if it's somewhat reminiscent of Microsoft's translucent Windows Vista Aero designs from nearly twenty years ago.\nThat said, as of the release of the iOS 26 beta 2, Apple has already incorporated some user feedback into the design, dialing back the transparency in at least some places. And while it will continue to evolve, Apple users won't be able to escape it: Liquid Glass was designed to make all of Apple's OSes more cohesive. Here's a look at how the translucent aesthetic will look with the new macOS Tahoe 26 on your desktop.\nWhat are the new and notable features of iOS 26?\niOS 26 has a laundry list of new features. Among the most worthwhile:\nPhone app redesign: You'll finally be able to scroll through contacts, recent calls and voicemail messages all on one screen. It also comes with a new feature called Hold Assist that'll notify you when an agent comes to the phone so you can avoid the elevator music and continue on with other tasks.\nLive Translation in Phone, FaceTime and Messages: iOS 26 is bringing the ability to have a conversation via phone call or text message with someone who speaks another language. Live Translation will translate your conversation in real time, which results in some stop-and-go interactions in the examples Apple shared during its presentation.\nPolls in group chats: Tired of sorting through what seems like hundreds of messages in your group chat? You and your friends will soon be able to create polls in group messages for deciding things like which brunch spot you're eating at or whose car you're taking on a road trip.\nFiltering unknown senders in Messages: If you haven't received spam texts about unpaid tolls or other citations, you're lucky. For those of us who have, those annoying messages will soon be filtered away in a separate folder.\nVisual Intelligence: Similar to a reverse Google image search, this new feature will allow you to search for anything that's on your iPhone screen. For instance, if you spot a pair of shoes someone is wearing in an Instagram photo, you can screenshot it and use Visual Intelligence to find those shoes (or similar ones) online.\nPhotos tabs are back: For anyone who's still frustrated with the Photos changes made last year, you'll be happy to know that your tabs are coming back. Library and Collections will have their own separate spaces so you don't have to scroll to infinity to find what you're looking for.\nFaceTime \"Communication Safety\" feature: A newer addition to iOS 26 appears to be the FaceTime \"Communication Safety\" feature that pauses communications if and when nudity is detected. The feature appears to be a child safety feature that uses on-device detection, thus obviating any cloud-based privacy issues. \nApple's Hold Assist will be nifty for those pesky services that put you on hold for 10 or more minutes. (Apple)\nWhich iPhones will be able to upgrade to iOS 26?\nA few iPhone models that run the current version of iOS — iPhone XR, XS and XS Max — won't be compatible with the latest upgrade. But any iPhones released in 2019 or later will be eligible for the iOS 26 update.\n\niPhone SE (second generation or later)\niPhone 11\niPhone 11 Pro\niPhone 11 Pro Max\niPhone 12\niPhone 12 mini\niPhone 12 Pro\niPhone 12 Pro Max\niPhone 13\niPhone 13 mini\niPhone 13 Pro\niPhone 13 Pro Max\niPhone 14\niPhone 14 Plus\niPhone 14 Pro\niPhone 14 Pro Max\niPhone 15\niPhone 15 Plus\niPhone 15 Pro\niPhone 15 Pro Max\niPhone 16e\niPhone 16\niPhone 16 Plus\niPhone 16 Pro\niPhone 16 Pro Max\n\nNot listed here are the presumed new iPhone 17 models (or maybe iPhone 26?) that are all but certain to be announced and released in September. \nHow to install iOS 26 beta\nThe iOS 26 public beta is now available to download via the Apple Beta Software Program. If you're not already a member, you'll need to sign up to try out all the latest features. Just visit beta.apple.com and sign up with your phone number or email address. It's free.\nOnce you're in, you can install it by going to Settings > General > Software Update and selecting iOS 26 public beta.\nA word of caution: Don't sign up with your main iPhone unless you're OK with any risks that occur with using an OS that isn't finalized.\nWhen will the final version of iOS 26 be released?\niOS 26 will be released to the public this fall. It usually comes in September, within a week of the Apple iPhone event. Last year, it rolled out to iPhone users on September 16 — exactly one week after the iPhone 16 lineup was announced.\nIf you're more interested in the Apple Intelligence features coming, here's everything Apple revealed for iOS, macOS and more during WWDC.

For reference, Earth generally takes approximately 86,400 seconds to make one full rotation. So, this won't be noticeable to humans and will not affect anything. There are numerous reasons why Earth could be spinning faster. This is expected to have a short-term impact on Earth's orbit. Scientists are puzzling over why Earth is speeding up at all. Approximately 245 million years ago, the dinosaurs roamed, and days were an hour and a half shorter than they are today. Science has measured Earth's rotation subtly slowing down since official records began in 1973. A research paper posted in Nature in 2023 suggests that Earth's core may have started slowing down as recently as 2010, which would explain Earth's faster rotation."

    "summary": "\nIf you're a devoted iPhone owner like me, you'll be excited to check out all the exciting new updates coming to Apple's operating system this fall: iOS 26. The coolest change, in my opinion, is the new Liquid Glass design (think Windows Vista, but arguably more thoughtful), which looks to be Apple's largest visual update in years. We spent two weeks test-driving it — you can check out our detailed hands-on iOS 26 preview, or you can try it out yourself by downloading and installing the public beta, available now. (While the beta is open to the public and stable, always remember there's a degree of risk involved with beta software.) Not ready to upgrade your smartphone this year? No worries, we'll help you find out if your phone will be able to run iOS 26.\nLast year, Apple didn't nix any iPhones from its eligibility list, but that's not the case for 2025 — a few models are getting cut this time. All iPhone 8 models and the iPhone X were the last to get the boot in 2023, and this year the 2018 models are getting left behind. If you have an ineligible device, you won't be able to download iOS 26 when it becomes available this fall.\nWe'll get to the bottom of which iPhones will support iOS 26 this year. To see what's coming with the latest OS and more, check out everything announced at Apple's WWDC June 9 event. One thing you shouldn't immediately expect is Apple's updated version of Siri, though the company is reportedly working on a 'stripped-down' AI chatbot to compete with ChatGPT.\nThese three iPhones won't be compatible with iOS 26\nUnlike last year, several iPhone models won't be eligible to download the newest iOS when it makes its debut this fall. This trio of models first released in 2018 won't be coming to the iOS 26 party:\n\niPhone XR\niPhone XS\niPhone XS Max\n\niPhones compatible with iOS 26\nWhile we don't yet know the new iPhones Apple will be dropping this fall — though there are iPhone 17 rumors — we do know, per Apple's site, that the phones listed below will be compatible with iOS 26.

However, you'll miss out on security updates which could potentially put your phone at risk for malware and other threats. Additionally, some apps may stop working if they require a certain version of iOS or later. And of course, you won't be able to access the latest features iOS 26 offers.\nWhen will iOS 26 become available?\nApple usually rolls out its latest iOS in mid-September, just a few days before the new iPhones hit store shelves. Last year, it released iOS 18 on Monday, Sept. 16. Expect a confirmation of the release date at the iPhone 17 event, expected in early September. \niOS 26 features we're excited about\nLiquid Glass design: Your home screen is getting revamped with new app icons, including dark mode and all-clear options.

    "full_text": "No worries, we'll help you find out if your phone will be able to run iOS 26. Unlike last year, several iPhone models won't be eligible to download the newest iOS when it makes its debut this fall. While we don't yet know the new iPhones Apple will be dropping this fall — though there are iPhone 17 rumors — we do know, per Apple's site, that the phones listed below will be compatible with iOS 26. However, you'll miss out on security updates which could potentially put your phone at risk for malware and other threats. Additionally, some apps may stop working if they require a certain version of iOS or later. And of course, you won't be able to access the latest features iOS 26 offers. Apple usually rolls out its latest iOS in mid-September, just a few days before the new iPhones hit store shelves. Liquid Glass design: Your home screen is getting revamped with new app icons, including dark mode and all-clear options. Phone app redesign: You'll finally be able to scroll through contacts, recent calls and voicemail messages all on one screen.

Spotify retains a comfortable market share lead among music streaming apps. One-third of the music streaming market is in North America,and the US market is expected to grow by 13% by 2030. A representative for Luminate, a music and entertainment data and analytics company, said that music streams reached nearly 5 trillion globally in 2024. \"Our 2025 Midyear Music Report shows continued streaming growth, but the rate has slowed compared to recent years,\" said a Luminate spokesperson. \"Whether it's streaming activity on gaming platforms or attitudes towards AI-generated content, younger listeners are more open to non-traditional and transmedia engagement,\" the spokesperson added."

    "summary": "Rivian has filed a lawsuit against Ohio's Department of Motor Vehicles because of the state's partial ban on direct car sales, The Verge reports. The company says that the ban \"reduces competition, decreases consumer choice and drives up consumer costs and inconvenience.\" Rivian believes Ohio's law is particularly unfair because it contains a carveout for the company's competitor Tesla.\nOhio currently requires the state DMV to not provide a dealership license to \"a manufacturer, or a parent company, subsidiary, or affiliated entity of a manufacturer, applying for a license to sell or lease new or used motor vehicles at retail.\" The law keeps car sales in the hands of independently owned car dealerships — except for Tesla. An exception was created for Tesla in 2014, The Columbus Dispatch writes, after the EV maker reached an agreement with the Ohio Dealership Association. Now cars in the state are sold through traditional car dealerships, and three dealerships owned and operated by Tesla.\n\"Rivian believes that consumers should be able to choose the vehicles they purchase,\" Rivian's Chief Administrative Officer Mike Callahan shared in a statement. \"Consumer choice is a bedrock principle of America's economy. Ohio's archaic prohibition against the direct-sales of vehicles is unconstitutional, irrational and harms Ohioans by reducing competition and choice and driving up costs and inconvenience.\"\nThe company's lawsuit does a good job of laying out the illogical situation Ohio has created with its ban. Rivian is allowed to perform repairs on cars in the state and deliver cars purchased out-of-state to Ohioans. \"Nonsensically, the thing that Rivian cannot do is actually complete the sale of Rivian vehicles in Ohio,\" the company writes. \"This imposes an extraordinary burden on Ohio consumers and Rivian for no legitimate reason.\"\nAs The Verge notes, bans on direct car sales have historically exist to prevent large, established car companies from having a monopoly on the sale of their own cars. Going direct to consumer is one of the ways EV makers have differentiated themselves from older brands, something companies like Tesla and Rivian can't do in states with bans. Rivian could try and strike a deal like Tesla, but filing a federal lawsuit suggests the company could be aiming to win a bigger, more lasting change. Rivian has achieved similar wins in the past.

The new feature is part of OpenAI's ongoing attempts to get users to cultivate a healthier relationship with the frequently compliant and overly-encouraging AI assistant.\nThe company's announcement suggests the \"gentle reminders\" will appear as pop-ups in chats that users will have to click or tap through to continue using ChatGPT. \"Just Checking In,\" OpenAI's sample pop-up reads. \"You've been chatting for a while — is this a good time for a break?\" The system is reminiscent of the reminders some Nintendo Wii and Switch games will show you if you play for an extended period of time, though there's an unfortunately dark context to the ChatGPT feature.\nThe \"yes, and\" quality of OpenAI's AI and it's ability to hallucinate factually incorrect or dangerous responses has led users down dark paths, The New York Times reported in June — including suicidal ideation. Some of the users whose delusions ChatGPT indulged already had a history of mental illness, but the chatbot still did a bad job of consistently shutting down unhealthy conversations. OpenAI acknowledges some of those shortcomings in its blog post, and says that ChatGPT will be updated in the future to respond more carefully to \"high-stakes personal decisions.\" Rather than provide a direct answer, the company says the chatbot will help users think through problems, offer up questions and list pros and cons.\nOpenAI obviously wants ChatGPT to feel helpful, encouraging and enjoyable to use, but it's not hard to package those qualities into an AI that's sycophantic.

    "full_text": "OpenAI has announced that ChatGPT will now remind users to take breaks if they're in a particularly long chat with AI. The new feature is part of OpenAI's ongoing attempts to get users to cultivate a healthier relationship with the frequently compliant and overly-encouraging AI assistant. The company's announcement suggests the \"gentle reminders\" will appear as pop-ups in chats that users will have to click or tap through to continue using ChatGPT. \"Just Checking In,\" OpenAI's sample pop-up reads. The system is reminiscent of the reminders some Nintendo Wii and Switch games will show you if you play for an extended period of time, though there's an unfortunately dark context to the ChatGPT feature. The \"yes, and\" quality of OpenAI's AI and it's ability to hallucinate factually incorrect or dangerous responses has led users down dark paths, The New York Times reported in June — including suicidal ideation. OpenAI acknowledges some of those shortcomings in its blog post, and says that ChatGPT will be updated in the future to respond more carefully to \"high-stakes personal decisions.\" Rather than provide a direct answer, the company says the chatbot will help users think through problems, offer up questions and list pros and cons. Taking breaks from ChatGPT — and having the AI do things without your active participation — will make issues like that less visible. Or, at the very least, it'll give users time to check whether the answers ChatGPT is providing are even correct."

Allowing Rivian to sell directly would not be treading new legal ground, the company argues in its complaint. That law, which Rivian says came after an intense lobbying effort by the Ohio Automobile Dealers Association (OADA), effectively gave Tesla a carve-out and blocked any future manufacturers from acquiring the necessary dealership licenses.

Amazon told TechCrunch that Wondery will continue to develop creator-led podcasts under the Wondery brand within a new team. What’s changing is that the company is separating the teams that oversee Wondery’s narrative podcast efforts from those developing its creator-led shows. Wondery is combining its narrative podcast studio, which includes podcasts like Dr. Death and American Scandal, with Audible. “The podcast landscape has evolved significantly in the past few years, particularly with the rise of video-forward, creator-led content,” Amazon said in an emailed statement. “These changes reflect that evolution and will streamline how Wondery integrates further into Amazon. By making these changes, we can better support creators in monetizing their content across multiple channels, help them expand their brand IP, and simplify the process for advertisers while making content more accessible to audiences wherever they prefer to consume it. This evolution builds on Wondery’s early success with video-forward shows and positions us to better serve creators, customers, and advertisers.” Despite securing big names in the business, the company is now shifting its strategy in an effort to better compete with rivals like Spotify and YouTube as the podcasting industry embraces video formats. Update: The article was updated to reflect that Amazon denied reports of Wondery shutting down."

Vine — something of a precursor to today’s TikTok, but with only six-second-long looping videos — was acquired by Twitter back in October 2012 for $30 million to expand the social media platform’s video ambitions. Unfortunately for Vine creators and fans, the company fumbled the app’s potential and decided to shut down Vine in 2016 by limiting all new uploads. Despite no longer having an App Store presence, Vine still has a place in the internet’s collective cultural consciousness. Through online compilations of the best Vines uploaded to YouTube, and through the careers of numerous creators who got their start on Vine, the company lives on to some extent, and its content continues to be discovered by new generations. In a poll posted on the social media app, he asked Twitter’s users, “Bring back Vine?” to which nearly 70% responded “yes.” Axios reported at the time that Twitter had devoted some engineers to working on the Vine reboot, but nothing ever came of it. Btw, we recently found the Vine video archive (thought it had been deleted) and are working on restoring user access, so you can post them if you want. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) August 2, 2025 It’s unclear whether Musk has any ambitions for Vine beyond getting its archive back online, however. Whether or not Musk will actually deliver on the promise remains to be seen, as the X post could have just been another way to draw attention to Grok AI, rather than being representative of a real effort inside the company to make old Vines available for reposting."

    "summary": "To tackle what's been called the plastic \"epidemic,\" the UN spun up a committee in 2022 tasked with brokering a legally binding global agreement. This ambitious treaty between UN member states was to address the full life cycle of plastics, from production to disposal: In short, define what counts as plastic pollution and curb the sorts of unchecked production that inevitably leads to it. But across five sessions since, countries have failed to reach a consensus on the text.\nWhat was meant to be the final session ended last year in Busan, South Korea without agreement, and representatives from 175 countries are now set to meet again for part two, this time in Geneva, Switzerland. INC-5.2 will take place from August 5 to 14, during which negotiators will attempt to see eye-to-eye on the points of the draft treaty that have thus far proven most contentious. According to the Center for International Environmental Law (CIEL), there are over 370 such points.\nScope\nProduction, the use of chemicals of concern (those considered to be a risk due to toxicity and/or other qualities), product design and the financing of treaty implementation are some of the main points of disagreement. These issues have left countries in a deadlock, according to Cate Bonacini, Communications Manager for CIEL. There are countries that argue health should be excluded from the treaty's scope. These topics will be front-and-center going back into the talks, and UN member states have spent the last eight months \"working hard in closed-door meetings to find points of agreement,\" Bonacini said in an email. \"We’ll see the fruits of that labor soon.\"\n\"At the heart of the issue,\" Bonacini said, \"there is a large disagreement about what plastic pollution is, and what measures are needed to end plastic pollution.\" While the commitment focuses on the full life cycle of plastics, there's been much dispute over where that cycle really begins.\n\"As scientists, we interpret the full life cycle as starting with extraction and production,\" said Bethanie Carney Almroth, a professor of ecotoxicology at the University of Gothenburg and a member of the Scientists' Coalition for an Effective Plastics Treaty. \"That would be fossil fuels and raw plastic production all the way through to product, to use, to trade, to transportation, to waste management, mismanagement and environmental pollution, including remediation of existing legacy plastics. All of it.\"\nWhile over 100 countries last December were in favor of a treaty that would impose production limits, others including Saudi Arabia and Russia opposed the caps. Ahead of that session, the US reportedly also made the decision not to support production caps, despite earlier indications that it would. Unsurprisingly, the countries that have taken issue with the scope of the treaty are also some of the world's top oil producers.\n\"There are other actors,\" Carney Almroth said, \"that are trying to narrow that scope to go from plastic products, like water bottles, to waste management, so sort of excluding the outer boundaries of how we define the plastics life cycle so that it would, in essence, become more of a waste management treaty.\"\nOutside influence\nIn addition to representatives from the participating member states, scientists, environmental organizations and industry lobbyists are present for the negotiation sessions. According to Carney Almroth, who has attended every Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee (INC) meeting and is now in Geneva for INC-5.2, increasingly it's been lobbyists who take up the most space.\n\"At the last round of talks, lobbyists for the petrochemical and plastics industries made up the single largest delegation,\" wrote Bangor University lecturer Winnie Courtene-Jones, who is also a member of the Coalition, in a recent article for The Conversation. CIEL found that \"there were three times more fossil fuel and chemical industry lobbyists than scientists\" at the Busan meetings. Bonacini noted that \"plastics are 99 percent fossil fuels, and these companies have a vested interest in continuing to generate fossil fuel-based products, including plastics.\"\nTheir influence has played a big role in the stalemate. They \"have a lot of power, money and influence,\" Carney Almroth said, \"and their lobbying efforts go beyond the walls of the negotiating space…They have access to decision makers in ways that other observers do not.\"\n\"They don't want to look at chemicals,\" Carney Almroth said. \"They don't want to look at production.\" But the science indicates that looking at chemicals (additives, processing aids, etc.) and production is of utmost importance, not only in the context of environmental sustainability but also human health.\nIn an editorial for the Bulletin of the World Health Organization in July, a group of scientists pointed to the numerous potential health effects that recent studies have linked to plastics, via exposure to hazardous chemicals and from micro- and nanoplastics. That includes an increased risk of \"multiple chronic diseases, including cancer, neurodevelopmental harm and infertility\" as well as \"respiratory, reproductive and gastrointestinal harm, with potential links to lung and colon cancer.\"\nThe authors called on delegates to prioritize these concerns in the upcoming negotiations and work toward a treaty that would end production of toxic chemicals in plastics, ban the recycling of plastics containing those chemicals and reduce plastic production overall. Their letter comes alongside a separate study published this summer in the journal Nature that identified over 4,200 chemicals of concern in plastics, out of the 16,325 total known plastic chemicals. The researchers argue that, on top of establishing transparency around the makeup of plastics and removing chemicals of concern, plastics must be simplified if they're going to be made safer.\nThe many chemicals that go into plastics \"can be released throughout the entire plastic life cycle, from feedstock extraction and production to use and waste,\" the authors write. \"Specific end-of-life treatments, such as uncontrolled landfilling or incineration, can further exacerbate chemical releases.\" The UN has warned that the negative effects at every stage in the life cycle of plastics disproportionately harm vulnerable populations worldwide, including indigenous peoples, low income families and rural communities.\nWhere things stand\nToday, plastic is more or less inescapable — microplastics can even be found in Antarctica now. And research increasingly suggests we aren't fully aware of how bad pollution levels really are.\nGlobal plastic production has more than doubled in the last 25 years, with upwards of 450 million metric tons now estimated to be produced annually. Recycled plastics make up just 6 percent of that total, a figure that's expected to stay the same even as global plastic use and waste generation are projected to rise 70 percent by 2040, according to the international Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). And each year, tens of millions of tons of plastic waste is disposed of in ways considered to be environmentally unsound, ending up in uncontrolled dumpsites, burned openly or accumulating on land and in bodies of water.\nA study published this summer, led by researchers from Utrecht University and the Royal Netherlands Institute for Sea Research, found that there may be far more plastic in the oceans than previously thought when accounting for particles even smaller than microplastics. The team collected water samples from 12 locations across the North Atlantic Ocean and measured the concentration of nanoplastics (plastic particles under 1 micrometer) at different depths. By the researchers' estimate, there could be as much as 27 million metric tons of nanoplastic in the North Atlantic alone. That's in the ballpark of previous global estimates for larger plastic waste across all of the ocean.\nIn another new study, researchers from France's University of Toulouse found we may be breathing in up to 100 times more microplastic particles indoors than previous estimates, based on measurements of airborne microplastics in the researchers' own apartments and car cabins.\nThe situation is urgent, especially for vulnerable populations, said Carney Almroth. \"The amounts of plastics we're producing today and the amount of plastic in the environment are astronomical,\" said Carney Almroth. As of a few years ago, \"we had twice the mass of plastic on the planet as the mass of all the animals on land, in water, including insects, and we have produced far more plastic since then.\"\nPlastics are \"overwhelming any and all of our waste management infrastructure, so we are not able to prevent pollution. We're not able to mitigate harm,\" Carney Almroth said. \"The impacts of plastics in the environment are very large scale, to the point where they're destabilizing vital Earth functions like climate, like nutrient cycling, like biodiversity. And then we have the human health impacts on top of that. It's an acute problem.\"\nThe logistics of averting catastrophe\nBut, as the past five sessions have illustrated, reaching an agreement on how to solve that problem isn't going to be easy. The trouble, in part, boils down to how the decisions are being made. So far, it's all being done by consensus rather than voting, Carney Almroth and Bonacini explained. That approach allows \"a single country veto power over decisions,\" Bonacini said.\nPetrochemical countries including Saudi Arabia, Russia, China, Iran, Kuwait, Qatar, India and Brazil have reportedly latched onto this, using \"obstructionist tactics\" to drag out the negotiations. Some have insisted \"without legal basis,\" according to CIEL, \"that decisions can only be made by consensus.\" Consensus, however, isn't the only option.\nThe draft Rules of Procedure allow for majority voting in the event a consensus can't be reached, but whether that will happen is yet to be seen. \"There are opportunities to force that rule,\" Carney Almroth said. But, a country (or countries) would have to step up and invoke it.\nAt this stage of the negotiations, there is a risk that countries will compromise on key provisions for time's sake, Bonacini said, which would ultimately weaken the treaty. And once a treaty is finalized, \"it can take years, if not decades, to make amendments to the original text,\" so getting it right the first time is crucial. International agreements that have taken a softer approach to addressing environmental issues, like the Paris Agreement — which lets countries set their own targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions — have been criticized for being insufficient in the face of rapidly rising global temperatures and climate change.\nIn June at the UN Ocean Conference, representatives for 95 countries that are part of the INC reaffirmed their commitment to a treaty that addresses the full life cycle of plastics, phases out \"the most problematic plastic products and chemicals of concern,\" improves product design to reduce environmental and health impacts and employs effective means of implementation. \"A treaty that lacks these elements, only relies on voluntary measures or does not address the full lifecycle of plastics will not be effective to deal with the challenge of plastic pollution,\" the group — which includes Canada, Australia, Colombia, Zimbabwe, the UK and Germany — wrote in a joint statement. These countries added that \"the treaty should provide for the possibility of decision-making, through regular UN procedures if all efforts to reach consensus have been exhausted.\"\nIf an agreement isn't reached this time around, there are a number of ways the next steps could play out. The talks could be stretched even further into another meeting, or countries could decide to take the matter somewhere else.\n\"Many countries are considering alternatives if negotiations fail,\" Christina Dixon, Ocean Campaign Lead for the Environmental Investigation Agency told Mongabay. \"Options include returning to the United Nations Environment Assembly (UNEA) to establish a new expanding mandate, creating a convention outside the UN for committed countries to move forward or adopting a protocol under an existing convention.\" The UNEA meets next in December.\nWe are, as Courtene-Jones wrote in The Conversation, at \"a critical crossroads.\" That's something advocates for a strong, science-based treaty all seem to agree on. \"There are a lot of places where we can really do a lot to make a difference, and make things better,\" said Carney Almroth. \"Countries need to be ambitious, and need to stand up and demand this.\"This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/science/will-the-un-finally-broker-a-treaty-to-end-plastic-pollution-130022025.html?src=rss",

Apple deals to exist, if you know where to look.Engadget keeps track of deals like these on a regular basis, so we can help you there. Below, we’ve collected the best Apple deals you can get right now on items like AirPods, MacBooks, iPads and more. Arguably the biggest caveat to note about Apple sales is that you’re almost never going to see discounts directly at Apple.com. Unless you shop refurbished, you’ll always pay top dollar direct at Apple, and for some things (like iPhones), that might be best. But you’ll find more discounts more often if you’re willing to shop at retailers like Amazon, Best Buy, Walmart, Target and others.\nBest MacBook deals\n \nApple MacBook Air (15-inch, M4) for $999 ($200 off): The 15-inch MacBook Air is nearly identical to the smaller version but features more robust speakers and a more spacious trackpad alongside its roomier display. $999 is the lowest price we've tracked.\nApple MacBook Air (15-inch, M3, 24GB RAM) for $1,299 ($400 off): The last-gen M3 MacBook Air has officially been discontinued, but it remains a superb laptop while the last bits of stock remain available. We gave this 15-inch model a score of 90 in our review — outside of its slower chip (which is still plenty fast for everyday use), marginally improved camera and inability to power two external displays with the lid open, it's virtually identical to the newer version. This deal applies to the model with the larger 24GB of memory in the Starlight colorway.\nApple iMac 24-inch (M4) for $1,185 (9 percent off): For an all-in-one solution, the M4 iMac is a good pick thanks to its powerful performance, standard 16GB of RAM and improved webcam. Just note that it only comes in the 24-inch screen size option. $1,149 is the lowest price we've tracked, but note that the deal only applies to the Pink model. Other colors are also on sale, but more expensive. \nBest Apple Watch deals\n \nApple Watch Ultra 2 for $650 ($149 off): Apple’s most premium smartwatch, the Ultra 2 has a killer 36-hour battery life, a handy Low Power mode for extended use and cellular connectivity by default.

This deal applies to the watch with the orange band. $650 is the lowest price we've tracked. \nApple Watch SE for $169 (32 percent off): We wouldn’t be surprised to see an update to Apple’s budget smartwatch sometime soon (and we have a few suggestions on the matter). But thanks to some serious discounts, the Apple Watch SE has turned out to be the most affordable way to get an iPhone companion for your wrist. Despite the lackluster screen and limited extra features, it handles the basics well. Also available at Walmart.\nBest AirPods deals\n \nAirPods Max (USB-C) for $450 ($99 off): If you’re looking for over-ear headphones with all of the conveniences of in-ear AirPods, the AirPods Max are one of your only options (with the others being Beats devices). The latest models have the same design as the originals, but now charge up via USB-C instead of Lightning. They went as low as $430 for Amazon's Prime Day. \nBest iPad deals\n \niPad Pro (M4, 11-inch) for $899 ($100 off): The most powerful iPad is the iPad Pro, and it’s the one to get if you’re even toying with the idea of using your new slab as a laptop replacement. Both the 11- and 13-inch models have gorgeous displays, thinner and lighter designs, a repositioned front camera and the excessively powerful M4 chip inside. Also at B&H Photo.\nBest Apple accessories deals\nApple Pencil (USB-C) for $69 ($10 off): This more affordable Apple Pencil doesn’t support pressure sensitivity, but it still makes for a useful stylus for the basics. If you’re a casual note-taker and can live without wireless charging, you’ll save a few bucks by picking this one up. Also available at Walmart.\nApple Pencil (2nd gen) for $99 ($30 off): The Second gen Pencil both attaches and charges magnetically, supports tilt and pressure sensitivity and allows for tool changes with a tap of the flat edge.

    "summary": "Most people think of AirTags when they picture a Bluetooth tracker. And indeed, Apple’s little white discs used to be the most capable option, relying on a vast finding network of nearby iPhones to pinpoint lost tags. But now, both Google and Samsung have implemented finding networks of their own. And other Bluetooth tracker companies, like Chipolo and Pebblebee, now have trackers that pair with either Google or Apple’s network too. In short, you’ve got a lot of options for tagging and tracking your keys, backpacks, luggage and more. So we tested all the major brands out there to see how they work and put together a guide to help you get the most out of your chosen tracker. Here are the best Bluetooth trackers you can buy.\nTable of contents\n\nThe best Bluetooth trackers for 2025\nWhat to look for in a Bluetooth tracking device\nHow we tested Bluetooth trackers \nOther Bluetooth trackers we tested \nBluetooth tracker FAQs\n\nBest Bluetooth trackers for 2025\n \n \n \n \nWhat to look for in a Bluetooth tracking device\nBluetooth trackers are small discs or cards that rely on short-range, low-energy wireless signals to communicate with your smartphone. Attach one of these gadgets your stuff and, if it’s in range, your phone can “ring” the chip so you can find it. These tracking devices offer other features like separation alerts to tell you when you’ve left a tagged item behind, or where a lost item was last detected. Some can even tap into a larger network of smartphones to track down your device when you’re out of range. Depending on what you want the tracker to do, there are a few specs to look for when deciding which to get. \nDevice compatibility\nLike most things from the folks in Cupertino, AirTags only work with products in the Apple ecosystem. Both Apple and Google have opened up access to the Find My and Find Hub networks to third-party manufacturers, including Chipolo and Pebblebee. Those two companies make device-agnostic models that will work with the larger tracking network from either brand, so iPhone and Android users can buy the same tag. Tile trackers work with either Android or Apple devices, but use Tile’s own Life 360 finding network. Samsung’s latest fob, the Galaxy SmartTag2, only works with Samsung phones and taps into a finding system that relies on other Samsung devices to locate lost tags.\nFinding network\nCrowd-sourced finding capabilities are what make headlines, with stories about recovering stolen equipment or tracking lost luggage across the globe. Using anonymous signals that ping other people’s devices, these Bluetooth tracking devices can potentially tell you where a tagged item is, even if your smartphone is out of Bluetooth range.\nApple’s Find My network is the largest, with over a billion iPhones and iPads in service all running Apple’s Find My app by default. So unless an iPhone user opts out, their phone silently acts as a location detector for any nearby AirTags. Apple recently increased the AirTag’s finding power by enabling you to share the location of a lost tag with a third party, party, like an airline. Chipolo fobs that work on Apple’s network have the same ability. Google launched its Find My Device network in 2024 and has since renamed it Find Hub, which, like Apple's fining app, combines devices and people finding in one place. That network is now a close second for the largest in the US\nNow that Google’s Find Hub network is up and running, it’s a close second for the largest in the US. Like Apple, Android users are automatically part of the network, but can opt-out by selecting the Google services option in their phone’s Settings app and toggling the option in the Find Hub menu. Samsung’s SmartTag 2 and related network also defaults to an opt-in status for finding tags and other devices.\nTile offers a large finding grid that includes Tile users, Amazon Sidewalk customers and people running the Life360 network. Life360 acquired Tile in 2021, and, according to the company, the Life360 network has more than 70 million monthly active users.\nIn our tests, AirTags and third-party tags using its network, like the Chipolo Pop and Pebblebee Clip Universal, were the fastest to track down lost items. They offered nearly real-time location data in moderately to heavily trafficked spots around Albuquerque, including a bar, bookstore and coffee shops in Nob Hill, along with various outdoor hangouts on UNM’s campus.\nSamsung's SmartTags were able to locate our lost items most of the time, though not with the same precision finding accuracy as AirTags. When we tested Google’s Find Hub (then called Find My Device) network right after launch, it was noticeably slower than Apple’s network when using the community finding feature. Testing it again in 2025, the time it took to locate a lost item was considerably improved, taking just a couple minutes for the community to track a fob. In our tests, Tile’s finding network wasn’t able to consistently locate its lost fobs.\n\n\n\n\n   Amy Skorheim / Engadget \n \n\nSeparation alerts\nHere’s where a tracker’s day-to-day utility really shines. A separation alert lets you know when you’ve traveled too far from your tagged items, which is useful if you want to make sure your laptop bag, or jacket or umbrella always comes with you when you leave the house.\nThese notifications work when you’re out and about too. If you’ve got a Bluetooth tracking device in your wallet and walk out of a restaurant without it, the separation alert should kick in, resulting in fewer lost items. This feature also tells you where your tagged item and phone were last paired, allowing you to retrace your steps if you happen to miss the alert.\nEach tracker handles left-behind items differently. AirTags and third-party fobs using its network (such as from Chipolo or Pebblebee) include the feature by default. Tile trackers require a yearly subscription to enable the alerts (currently $30 annually). Tags working with the Google's Find Hub network don’t offer the feature at all, but Chipolo Pop tags can issue left-behind alerts using its own Android app. Both AirTags and Tiles allow you to turn off separation alerts at certain locations, meaning you can set your home as a “safe” place where items can be left behind, but alerts will still trigger elsewhere.\nIn our tests, AirTags and others using the Find My network alerted us between the 600- and 1,400-foot mark. Tiles sent a notification after about an average of 1,500 feet and were more consistent when using an Android phone than an iPhone. Chipolo Pop tags paired with an Android phone and using its own app sent an alert when we got around 450 feet away from our tagged item.\nConnectivity, volume and design\nThe feature you may use most often is the key finder function, which makes the tracker ring when you hit a button in the app. With Apple's AirTags, you can say \"Hey Siri, where are my keys?\" and the assistant will ring the tag (assuming it doesn't mistakenly think you're asking for directions to the Floridian archipelago). You can also use the Find Item app in your Apple Watch to ring your fob. Asking smart home/personal assistants like Alexa or the Google Assistant to find your keys will work with Chipolo, Tile and Pebblebee trackers linked to your Android device.\nIf you have your tag but can’t find your phone, some trackers will let you ring them to find your handset. SmartTag2 fobs reliably rang our Galaxy phone when we double-pressed it. Tile trackers have the same feature. Chipolo Pop trackers can ring your phone, but uses the Chipolo app to do so, which can run concurrently with the Find My or Find Hub connection. AirTags and any third-party tags using only Apple or Google’s networks don’t offer this feature.\nThe volume of the Bluetooth tracking device may determine whether you can find an item buried in your couch cushions or in a noisy room. AirTags have a reputation for being on the quiet side, and that aligned with what we saw (measuring roughly 65 decibels). Chipolo’s Pop tags and Tile’s Pro model measure between 83 and 86 decibels on average. Pebblebee’s new Clip Universal was the loudest of any tag we’ve tested, clocking in at 91 ear-splitting decibels.\nDesign will determine what you can attach the tracker to. AirTags are small, smooth discs that can’t be secured to anything without accessories, which are numerous, but that is an additional cost to consider. Chipolo, Pebblebee and Tile offer trackers with holes that easily attach to your key ring, and all three companies also offer card-shaped versions designed to fit in your wallet. Pebblebee Clip Universal tags come with a handy carabiner-style key ring.\nBatteries are replaceable for AirTag, Tile Pro, SmartTag2 and Chipolo Pop fobs and each should go for at least a year before needing to be swapped. Tile Mate and card-shaped trackers don’t have replaceable batteries, which means you’ll have to replace the entire unit whenever it dies. Pebblebee trackers are rechargeable in both the disc and wallet variety. They’re also the only tags equipped with onboard LEDs.\nStalking, theft and data privacy\nAirTags have gotten a lot of attention and even prompted some lawsuits for Apple due to bad actors planting them on people in order to stalk them. While this fact may not influence your buying decision, any discussion of Bluetooth trackers should note what steps Apple, Google and Tile have taken to address the issue. Last year, all the major players in the Bluetooth tracker business teamed up to combat misuse and standardize how unauthorized tracking detection and alerts work for iOS and Android.\nLast year, Tile launched a feature called Anti-Theft Mode, which enables you to render one of its trackers undetectable by others. That means if someone steals your tagged item, they won’t be able to use the anti-stalking features to find and disable the tracker. That sort of negates one of the major ways potential stalking victims can stay safe, so Tile hopes ID verification and a $1 million penalty will deter misuse. Separately, Tile was hit by a data breach, raising different privacy concerns. The company issued a statement about the event, which it shared with Engadget:\n\nSimilar to many other companies, Life360 recently became the victim of a criminal extortion attempt. We received emails from an unknown actor claiming to possess Tile customer information. We promptly initiated an investigation into the potential incident and detected unauthorized access to a Tile customer support platform (but not our Tile service platform). The potentially impacted data consists of information such as names, addresses, email addresses, phone numbers, and Tile device identification numbers. It does not include more sensitive information, such as credit card numbers, passwords or log-in credentials, location data, or government-issued identification numbers, because the Tile customer support platform did not contain these information types.\n\n\nWe believe this incident was limited to the specific Tile customer support data described above and is not more widespread. We take this event and the security of customer information seriously. We have taken and will continue to take steps designed to further protect our systems from bad actors, and we have reported this event and the extortion attempt to law enforcement. We remain committed to keeping families safe online and in the real world.\n\nAs a theft deterrent, a Bluetooth tracker may or may not be the best option. Anecdotal stories abound in which people have recovered stolen goods using a tracker — but other tales are more cautionary. Neither Apple nor Google promotes its trackers or finding networks as a way to deal with theft. GPS trackers, on the other hand, are typically marketed for just that purpose.\nHow we tested Bluetooth trackers\nBefore deciding on which trackers to test, we researched the field, looking at user reviews on Amazon, Best Buy and other retailers, along with discussions on sites like Reddit. We also checked out what other publications had to say on the matter before narrowing down our options to Apple AirTag, Tile, and Chipolo trackers. When Samsung's SmartTag 2 came out in October of 2023, we added that to our testing, along with Pebblebee's rechargeable Clip tracker. After Google launched its finding network (now called Find Hub), both Chipolo and Pebblebee released trackers in 2025 that work with either network and we tested the Pop and Universal key fob models and updated our top picks accordingly.\nHere’s the full list of every tracker we tested:\n\nApple AirTag\nChipolo Card Spot\nChipolo One Spot\nChipolo One\nChipolo Card\nChipolo Pop\nPebblebe Clip Universal\nPebblebee Clip\nSamsung SmartTag 2\nChipolo One Point\nPebblebee Clip for Android\nTile Pro (2024)\nTile Mate (2024)\nTile Mate (2022)\nTile Pro (2022)\nTile Slim (2022)\n\nAfter acquiring the trackers, I tested each one over the course of a few weeks using both an iPhone 11 and a Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra. I recreated likely user experiences, such as losing and leaving items behind at home and out in the city. I planted trackers at different spots near downtown Albuquerque, mostly concentrated in and around the University of New Mexico and the surrounding neighborhood of Nob Hill. Later, I conducted tests in the Queen Anne neighborhood of Seattle. Each test was performed multiple times, both while walking and driving and I used the measure distance feature on Google Maps to track footage for alerts. I paid attention to how easy the app was to use, how reliable the phone-to-tracker connection was and any other perks and drawbacks that came up during regular use.\nAs new trackers come to market, or as we learn of worthy models to try, I'll test them and add the results to this guide. I'm currently in the process of obtaining Motorola Moto tags and look forward to seeing how they work with an Android phone. \nOther Bluetooth trackers we tested\nTile Pro and Tile Mate (2024)\nTile recently came out with a new suite of trackers, replacing the Tile Mate, Tile Pro, Tile Sticker and Tile Slim with updated models. In addition to fun new colors for the Mate and Slim, Tile added an SOS feature that can send a notification to your Life360 Circle when you triple press the button on the tracker. It’s a clever addition that turns your keys into a panic button, something offered by personal safety companies as standalone devices.\nThere are a few caveats: You and the people you want to notify in an emergency will need the Life360 app installed on your phones. If you want your Tile to also trigger a call to emergency services, you’ll need a $15-per-month Life360 subscription (that’s in addition to a Tile membership, which starts at $3/month or $30 annually). And enabling the SOS triple-press disables the ability to ring your phone with the fob.\nI tested the SOS feature and it did indeed send a text message to my Circle, with the message that I had triggered an SOS and a link to a website that showed my current location. I thought it odd that the link didn’t open the Life360 app (which shows the location of users' phones), but I wasn’t as much concerned with Tile’s personal safety features as I was with the tracking capabilities, which turned out to be less than ideal.\nFor my tests, I planted Tile trackers in a densely populated area of Seattle (about 15,000 people per square mile). After setting the trackers to “lost” in the Tile app, I waited. After four hours, one of the trackers was not discovered by the finding community, so I went and retrieved it. Another fob I planted alerted me that the tracker had been found by the Tile community after three hours — but the location it gave me was off by a third of a mile. I then decided to plant a tracker in the most populated place I could think of — the dried fruit and nuts aisle of a Trader Joes on a Friday evening before a major holiday. It still took over a half an hour before another Tile user anonymously pinged my lost tracker.\nIn my tests with Samsung’s trackers and the fobs on Google’s Find Hub network, it took around ten minutes for them to be discovered. AirTags took half that time and all were tested in a far less populated city. Four hours with no ping and over a half hour before getting a hit in a crowded TJs were pretty long stretches.\nOur top pick, the classic Chipolo, has virtually no finding network. But if you’re getting a tracker for that feature alone, you should go with AirTags if you have an iPhone or the Google-enabled Chipolo or Pebblebee trackers if you use an Android phone. We prefer the Chipolo because it works with either iOS or Android devices, it rings loud, it’s quick to tell you when you’ve left it behind and it connects nearly instantly when you’re searching for a misplaced tracker around the house.\nTile devices also work with both mobile operating systems and its latest models are indeed louder than they were before. But they aren’t as quick to connect and you need to pay for a membership to activate left-behind alerts. And when you do, those notifications don’t kick in as quickly as they do with competing trackers.\nBluetooth tracker FAQs\nWhich Bluetooth tracker has the longest range?\nBoth the Tile Pro and the Samsung Galaxy SmartTag2 claim a maximum range of around 400 feet, which is longer than the 300-foot claim for Chipolo’s Pop tags. The Pebblebee Clip Universal claims a 500-foot range, though other trackers with a shorter claimed range performed better in our tests. Apple doesn’t make range claims for AirTags. Any Bluetooth signal, of course, is dependent on a few factors. Obstacles like walls and people can block the signal, so a clear line of sight is the only way to achieve the maximum range. Other signals, like Wi-Fi, can also interfere with Bluetooth connections. Even high humidity can have an effect and lessen the distance at which your phone will connect to your tracker.\nRemember, when considering the range of Bluetooth trackers, the size of the “finding network” also comes into play. This is the number of nearby phones that can be used to anonymously ping your tracker when your own phone is out of Bluetooth range. As of now, Apple AirTags have the largest network, followed by Google’s Find Hub, Samsung’s finding community and Tile’s Life360 members.\nWhat is the best Bluetooth tracker for a car?\nBluetooth trackers are designed to track small, personal items like keys, jackets, backpacks and the like. All trackers have safeguards to prohibit the tag from being used to stalk people, so most will alert someone if a tracker that does not belong to them is detected following them. That means a car thief may get tipped off that there’s a tracker in the car they’re trying to steal. That said, you’ll see plenty of stories about people finding their car thanks to a Bluetooth tracker. Some police departments have even handed out trackers to combat high rates of carjacking. In most instances, the tracker of choice has been AirTags thanks to their wide finding network. If you’re looking for a tracker for your car, you may want to look into GPS trackers, some of which are designed for just that purpose.\nHow accurate are Bluetooth trackers?\nAccuracy for Bluetooth trackers can be looked at in two ways: Finding items nearby and finding items misplaced outside your home. For nearby items, you’ll most often use the ring function on the device to hunt it down. Two tags, Apple’s AirTags and Samsung’s Galaxy SmartTag2, also use ultra-wideband technology, which creates directional navigation on your phone to get you within a foot of the tracker.\nAccurately finding lost items outside your home depends on the size of the finding network. Since this relies on the serendipity of a random phone passing within Bluetooth range of your tracker, the more phones on a given network, the better. And since Bluetooth ranges and distance estimates are only precise within about a meter or so, getting pings from more than one phone will help locating items. Here again, it’s worth noting that Apple’s Find My network is the largest, followed by Google, Samsung and Tile (both Chipolo and Pebblebee have fobs that work with the Apple and Google networks).\nRecent Updates\nAugust 2025: Updated the name of Google's finding network to Find Hub, instead of Find My Device. Added details about Pebblebee's new Alert feature. Added a table of contents. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-bluetooth-tracker-140028377.html?src=rss",

    "full_text": "The Switch 2 Pro controller is the best controller Nintendo has ever made – and that’s saying something. It’s incredibly comfortable to hold, its joysticks are buttery smooth, and all of its buttons are wonderfully responsive. Nintendo even made it customizable this time with rear buttons that can easily be mapped inside of any game. The Switch 2 Pro Controller costs $85, which seems a bit egregious when you can get an excellent controller like 8BitDo’s Ultimate 2 wireless gamepad for $60. As good as the competition is, though, you won’t find anything that can be easily configured directly from within the Switch 2’s user interface. My hands often feel cramped when I play that game with the Switch 2’s Joy-Con 2 controllers for too long. But there’s none of that with the Switch 2 Pro controller. I was able to race for an hour without any discomfort, and I also noticed that it was easier for me to pull off the game’s tricky jump maneuvers and rail sliding. The Switch 2 Pro controller is also seriously helpful with fighting games, thanks to its smooth and accurate directional pad. It acquits itself to most genres easily, though it would have been nice to see analog triggers for more precise control in serious racing games."

According to a report from Bloomberg, the latest BioShock game that's being developed by Cloud Chamber failed a review with executives at 2K Games. Bloomberg's sources explained that the execs wanted improvement with the game's narrative, which \"will be revamped in the coming months.\"\n2K Games said in a statement to Bloomberg that it currently has a \"good game, but we are committed to delivering a great one.\" As the fourth installment in the hit BioShock franchise, it has to follow up on the success of BioShock Infinite, which was released in 2013 and earned several awards for overall design, gameplay, story and original soundtrack.

The breakout hit that threw players into the unique setting of Rapture came out in 2007 and has since been remastered in 2016 as part of BioShock: The Collection.

    "full_text": "BioShock fans will have to wait even longer to find out if we're going to Rapture, Columbia or a brand new city since the next game in the franchise may be headed back to the drawing board. According to a report from Bloomberg, the latest BioShock game that's being developed by Cloud Chamber failed a review with executives at 2K Games. Bloomberg's sources explained that the execs wanted improvement with the game's narrative, which \"will be revamped in the coming months.\" 2K Games said in a statement to Bloomberg that it currently has a \"good game, but we are committed to delivering a great one.\" As the fourth installment in the hit BioShock franchise, it has to follow up on the success of BioShock Infinite, which was released in 2013 and earned several awards for overall design, gameplay, story and original soundtrack. The latest development hitch also comes along with some major changes in the game studio's leadership.

    "summary": "Amazon is selling the DJI Mini 4K drone for just $249, which is a discount of $50. The deal is only for Prime members. This is the lowest price we've seen for this particular model since early in the year.\nThe Mini 4K is a beginner-friendly drone, but it's still got plenty of nifty features. As the name suggests, it can capture 4K video at up to 30 FPS. It can also record 2.7K footage at 60 FPS. There's 2x digital zoom, a 3-axis gimbal and electrical image stabilization. The drone can transmit 1080p video from up to 10km away. \n \nIt offers level-5 wind resistance, which is nice, and can fly for up to 31 minutes per charge. The drone allows for one-tap movements and comes with a dedicated remote. Users can also access the companion app for additional controls and to access flight tutorials.\nPerhaps the coolest feature here is the size and form factor. The Mini 4K is small enough that it doesn't require FAA registration, so you can take it out immediately after unboxing. It's also foldable, making it easy to store when not in use. This particular model didn't make our list of the best drones, but its more expensive sibling, the Mini 4 Pro, was our very favorite.\nFollow @EngadgetDeals on X for the latest tech deals and buying advice.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/prime-members-can-get-the-dji-mini-4k-drone-on-sale-for-249-150201768.html?src=rss",

The boy's mother also filed a report, didn't receive anything but an automated response, and had to follow up before receiving a response that Twitter didn't find any policy violations and wouldn't take further action, according to the lawsuit. The suit claimed that Twitter eventually removed the post nine days after the initial report, suspended the poster's account and reported the content to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, which is required by federal law. The lawsuit could set a major precedent in how social media platforms operate, especially if it makes it to the Supreme Court, but X will first have to defend itself against these claims again in district court thanks to this latest decision.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/x-has-to-prove-it-wasnt-negligent-when-removing-csam-from-its-site-173645506.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Whew, it's been a crazy few weeks for us at Engadget. School may still be out, but there's no summer break for the steady stream of new gadgets coming across our desks. I'll forgive you if you missed a review or two over the last few weeks — we've been busy. Here's a quick rundown of what we've been up to, just in time for you to catch up over the weekend. \nSamsung Z Flip 7\n \nAlongside the Z Fold 7, Samsung debuted an updated version of its more compact foldable, the Z Flip 7. UK bureau chief Mat Smith noted that the company managed to provide a substantial overhaul, but there are some areas that were left untouched. \"Certain aspects of the Flip 7 are lacking, most notably the cameras, which haven’t been changed since last year,\" he said. \"Samsung also needs to put more work into its Flex Window.\" \nOakley Meta glasses\n \nMeta's first non-Ray-Ban smart glasses have arrived. While we wait for a more affordable version to get here, senior editor Karissa Bell put the white and gold option through its paces. \"While I don't love the style of the Oakley Meta HSTN frames, Meta has shown that it's been consistently able to improve its glasses,\" she wrote. \"The upgrades that come with the new Oakley frames aren't major leaps, but they deliver improvements to core features.\"\nDJI Osmo 360\n \nReporter Steve Dent argued that DJI is finally giving Insta360 some competition in the 360-degree action cam space. The design and performance of the Osmo 360 are great, but the problem comes when it's time to edit. \"The all-new DJI Studio app also needs some work,\" he explained. \"For a first effort, though, the Osmo 360 is a surprisingly solid rival to Insta360’s X5.\"\nNothing Phone 3\n \nNothing's first \"true flagship\" phone has arrived, ready to take on the likes of the Pixel 9 and Galaxy S25. Despite the company's lofty chatter, Mat argued the Nothing Phone 3 is hampered by a lower-power chip and disappointing cameras. \"While I want Nothing to continue experimenting with its phones, it should probably prioritize shoring up the camera performance first,\" he said.\nSamsung Galaxy Watch 8\n \nSamsung debuted a big update to its Galaxy Watch line when it unveiled the Z Fold 7 and Z Flip 7. Senior buying advice reporter Amy Skorheim spent two weeks testing the new wearable, which impressed her so much she declared it was \"Samsung's best smartwatch in years.\" You can read her in-depth review here.\nEverything else we tested\nHere are the rest of the reviews you might have missed:\n\nLegion Go S powered by SteamOS by Sam Rutherford\nBowers & Wilkins Px7 S3 by Billy Steele \nNordVPN, Proton VPN, ExpressVPN and Surfshark VPN reviews by Sam Chapman\ns.p.l.i.t by Jessica Conditt\nPorsche 911 GTS by Tim Stevens\niOS 26 beta by Mat Smith\nDonkey Kong Bananza by Nathan Ingraham\nAnker Nebula X1 by Steve Dent\nWaterfield Magnetic Case for Switch 2 by Sam Rutherford\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/engadget-review-recap-samsung-z-flip-7-oakley-meta-glasses-dji-osmo-360-and-more-130012194.html?src=rss",

DJI/Engadget 86 100 Expert Score DJI Osmo 360 DJI’s Osmo 360 is a worthy rival to Insta360’s X5, thanks to the innovative sensor and 8K 50 fps video. Reporter Steve Dent argued that DJI is finally giving Insta360 some competition in the 360-degree action cam space. \"The all-new DJI Studio app also needs some work,\" he explained. The bigger screen, battery and new Glyph Matrix make it a major step up from Phone 2, but camera performance is erratic and you’d expect a more powerful processor at this price.

    "summary": "Welcome to our latest recap of what's going on in the indie game space. A bunch of new games dropped this week that are more than worthy of your attention, including a modern take on an old-school Ninja Gaiden side-scroller and a joyful (perhaps even profound) puzzler about the life of a housefly.\nBy far the biggest story in indie games over the last few weeks concerns payment processors pressuring the likes of Steam owner Valve and Itch to remove or de-index games that feature adult, NSFW and LGBTQIA+ themes. Under the guise of helping to protect women and children, an conservative activist group in Australia has taken credit for the delistings, as well as stricter rules regarding adult-themed games that Steam and Itch have implemented. But some affected developers suggest this is a smokescreen to push forward an agenda of anti-LGBTQIA+ censorship.\nThis week, Engadget senior editor Jess Conditt spoke with solo developer Cara Cadaver of Final Girl Games about the impact of the censorship campaign. Valve permanently banned Cadaver's new game, VILE: Exhumed, from Steam for allegedly depicting \"sexual content with depictions of real people,\" though the developer says that assessment is inaccurate. While Cadaver and publisher DreadXP are working on alternative distribution for VILE: Exhumed, Steam is the go-to marketplace for many PC gamers and the ban cuts off what surely would have been a critical source of revenue for the game.\nFor its part, Itch has started reindexing free adult-themed games on its platform. The company has relied on Stripe and Paypal for processing payments. It has suspended payments via Stripe for 18+ content and it's talking to other potential payment partners \"that are more willing to work with this kind of content.\" In any case, payment processors should not be the arbiters of morality, and they certainly should not be helping activists restrict access to perfectly above-board works of art.\nOne other piece of news that caught my eye this week is about a game jam that's taking place this month. Participants will have just over three weeks to make games based on real-life investigative reporting. According to Global Game Jam, the teams will gain access to exclusive reporting on organized crime and corruption from around the world and be able to ask journalists behind those stories questions about their work. It's a fascinating idea, and I'm really looking forward to seeing what the developers that get involved come up with.\nNew releases\n\nNinja Gaiden: Ragebound is what I like to call a “hell yeah\" game. There are few purer joys than getting about 15-20 minutes into a new game and thinking “hell yeah, this rules.” Even better, that feeling lasted through the other four hours or so I spent with Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound.\nThis is a throwback 2D hack-and-slash platformer from The Game Kitchen — the studio behind the Blasphemous series — and publisher Dotemu, which is building quite the reputation for itself as a purveyor of retro-style games (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge, the upcoming Marvel Cosmic Invasion). Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound looks and sounds sumptuous, with gorgeous pixel art and stellar level, character and audio design. It’s got combat that's somehow both sticky and slick, and it’s challenging without being too frustrating.\nI've had a tremendous time with this one, which, if memory serves me correct, is the first Ninja Gaiden game I’ve played. I can’t really find any notable faults with Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound. It’s well worth checking out. It’s out now on Steam, PS5, Xbox Series X/S and Nintendo Switch.\n\nHere’s another “hell yeah\" game. I’ve been looking forward to Time Flies ever since I clapped eyes on it during a Day of the Devs showcase a couple of years ago. You play as a fly and the goal is to check off a bucket list of items before the insect perishes (their lifespan equates to the average life expectancy of a country of your choosing but in seconds).\nIt’s a clever, funny and slightly rude — in a playful, Thank Goodness You’re Here sort of way — blend of exploration and puzzle game that makes a strong case as to why we should make the most of our limited time. It’s a short game, as it took me about 90 minutes to roll credits. That's pretty much the ideal length for this one.\nThe controls are simple (only a D-pad, pause button and a way to call up the bucket list are required) and the aesthetic, which features hand-drawn art, is delightfully low-key too. In fact, this would be a perfect fit for the Playdate, which just happens to come from Panic, the publisher of Time Flies. For now, though, you can check out this lovely little game from the team at Playables on Steam, PS5 and Nintendo Switch.\n\nWhatnot Games released the 1.0 version Star Racer on Steam this week after over a year of early access. This is a retro racer very much in the vein of the F-Zero series that features local multiplayer (here's hoping for online multiplayer at some point) and music from Grant Kirkhope of Banjo-Kazooie and GoldenEye 007 fame. You can also create your own tracks and share them with others online.\nI love the launch trailer for Star Racer, which blends gameplay with '80s-style animation. I also adore that — per Rock Paper Shotgun — one of the characters is a \"detective-looking fella called Thrash Whiplash.\" If that's not in the running for the best video game character name of the 2020s, we're all going to need to take a long, hard look in the mirror.\n\nWe have yet another flavor of pretty, retro-tinged pixel art this week thanks to developers Ancient Corporation and Bitwave Games, as well as publisher Limited Run Games. Their 16 bit-style shoot-'em-up Earthion landed on Steam this week.\nIt features music from legendary composer Yuzo Koshiro (Streets of Rage, ActRaiser, Shenmue and many more games). That probably should not come as a huge shock given that he co-founded Ancient. \nEarthion is also slated to hit consoles starting in September. Being a Limited Run title, physical editions are of course on the way for PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox Series X and Nintendo Switch. Expect those later this year. A physical version is also expected for Sega Genesis/Mega Drive in 2026.\n\nSurgent Studios went in a completely different direction for its follow-up to its well-received Metroidvania from last year, Tales of Kenzera: Zau. Its latest project (released with the help of the publishing arm of Palworld creator Pocketpair), Dead Take, is a first-person psychological horror about an actor who is looking for a friend who has vanished after a Hollywood party.\nThere's top-tier videogame acting talent here, with Neil Newbon (Astarion in Baldur's Gate 3) and Ben Starr (Clive Rosfield in Final Fantasy XVI) taking on the lead roles, and a litany of other well-known performers — from Laura Bailey to Sam Lake — also making appearances. That cast alone makes this worthy of attention. Dead Take is out now on Steam and the Epic Games Store.\n\nIt feels like we've been waiting forever for Hobbit life sim Tales of the Shire: A The Lord of the Rings Game to drop and, following some delays, it's now available on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch and Steam. (This is now technically an indie game because Take-Two sold off publisher Private Division last year.)\n\nI love games that tell you exactly what they're about in their title and A Game About Digging A Hole sure is one of those. You dig a hole, find buried goodies, and sell them to help you buy better gear. \nDeveloper DoubleBee and publishers Rokaplay and Headup brought this exploration game to iOS and Android this week after a hugely successful debut on Steam earlier this year. A Game About Digging A Hole has now sold more than 1 million copies.\n\nPerhaps you're looking for a different digging game to check out this weekend. In that case, Mashina may be worth considering. The titular character is a robot that searches for valuable minerals to help repair and expand her community. Mashina can also use the minerals to build machines that can help with her digs, while she can use items she stumbles upon for base decoration.\nDevelopers Jack King-Spooner and Talha Kaya (who previously released Judero) used traditional stop-motion techniques to animate Mashina. This charming-looking puzzle/exploration game is now available on Steam.\n\nLet's wrap up this section with a short, experimental game about anxiety. A Dream About Parking Lots has been out on Steam for a few months and the aptly named Interactive Dreams (with the help of Take It Studio!) brought it to PS5, Xbox Series X/S and Nintendo Switch this week. It's said to be based on real dreams and will see you looking for your car among parking lots and mazes while chatting with a therapist. \nUpcoming\n\nWander Stars — from Paper Castle Games and publisher Fellow Traveller — was supposed to be arriving this week, but the developers have pushed the release date back until September 19. The team wants to carry out some changes to improve the game following feedback from an open beta.\nI really like the look of this one, and though turn-based combat isn't usually my cup of tea, I'm very intrigued by the system that's in use here. You'll find and combine words into phrases that convert into devastating attacks. There are more than 200 words and they have cooldowns, so combining them in smart ways will be a key to success. Using words \"with honor\" can seemingly help you unlock more useful phrases too. Very curious to see how all of that works in practice. We'll get a better idea next month, when Wander Stars lands on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch and PC.\n\nSpeaking of games with a killer look, a gameplay trailer for I Hate This Place hooked me in this week. This is an isometric survival horror game that pulls from the visual stylings of its comic book origins. Crafting is vital here, both in terms of your arsenal and strengthening your shelter before nightfall. This stylish title from Rock Square Thunder and publisher Broken Mirror Games is bound for PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S and Nintendo Switch later this year.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/a-terrific-2d-ninja-gaiden-housefly-bucket-lists-and-other-new-indie-games-worth-checking-out-110005806.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "A jury in Florida has found Tesla partially liable for a 2019 crash involving the company's Autopilot self-driving feature, The Washington Post reports. As a result, the company will have to pay $43 million in compensatory damages and even more in punitive damages.\nAutopilot comes pre-installed on Tesla's cars and handles things like collision detection and emergency braking. Tesla has mostly avoided taking responsibility for crashes involving cars with the Autopilot enabled, but the Florida case played out differently. The jury ultimately decided that the self-driving tech enabled driver George McGee to take his eyes off the road and hit a couple, Naibel Benavides Leon and Dillon Angulo, ultimately killing one and severely injuring the other. \nDuring the case, Tesla's lawyers argued that McGee's decision to take his eyes off the road to reach for his phone was the cause of the crash, and that Autopilot shouldn't be considered. The plaintiffs, Angulo and Benevides Leon's family, argued that the way Tesla and Elon Musk talked about the feature ultimately created the illusion that Autopilot was safer than it really was. \"My concept was that it would assist me should I have a failure … or should I make a mistake,\" McGee said on the stand. \"And in that case I feel like it failed me.\" The jury ultimately assigned two-thirds of the responsibility to McGee and a third to Tesla, according to NBC News.\nWhen reached for comment, Tesla said it would appeal the decision and gave the following statement: \nToday’s verdict is wrong and only works to set back automotive safety and jeopardize Tesla’s and the entire industry’s efforts to develop and implement life-saving technology. We plan to appeal given the substantial errors of law and irregularities at trial. Even though this jury found that the driver was overwhelmingly responsible for this tragic accident in 2019, the evidence has always shown that this driver was solely at fault because he was speeding, with his foot on the accelerator – which overrode Autopilot – as he rummaged for his dropped phone without his eyes on the road. To be clear, no car in 2019, and none today, would have prevented this crash. This was never about Autopilot; it was a fiction concocted by plaintiffs’ lawyers blaming the car when the driver – from day one – admitted and accepted responsibility. \nIn a National Highway Traffic Safety Administration investigation of Autopilot from 2024, crashes were blamed on driver misuse of Tesla's system and not the system itself. The NHTSA also found that Autopilot was overly permissive and \"did not adequately ensure that drivers maintained their attention on the driving task,\" which lines up with the 2019 Florida crash.\nWhile Autopilot is only one component of Tesla's larger collection of self-driving driving features, selling the idea that the company's cars could safely driving on their own is a key part of its future. Elon Musk has claimed that Full Self-Driving (FSD), the paid upgrade to Autopilot, is \"safer than human driving.\" Tesla's Robotaxi service relies on FSD being able to function with no or minimal supervision, something that produced mixed results in the first few days the service was available. \nUpdate, August 1, 6:05PM ET: This story was updated after publication to include Tesla's statement.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/tesla-found-partially-liable-for-a-deadly-2019-crash-193612682.html?src=rss",

It can now generate revenue from licensing its remaining spectrum and towers."

After complaints, OpenAI's chief information security officer, Dane Stuckey, said the company is working to remove the chats from search engines.\nThe public outrage stems from a Fast Company article from earlier this week (via Ars Technica). Fast Company said it found thousands of ChatGPT conversations in Google search results. The indexed chats didn't explicitly include identifying information. But in some cases, their contents reportedly contained specific details that could point to the source.\nTo be clear, this wasn't a hack or leak. It was tied to a box users could tick when creating a shareable URL directing to a chat. In the pop-up for creating a public link, the option to \"Make this chat discoverable\" appeared. The more direct explanation (\"allows it to be shown in web searches\") appeared in a smaller, grayer font below. Users had to tick that box to make the chat indexed.\nYou may wonder why people creating a public link to a chat would have a problem with its contents being public. But Fast Company noted that people could have made the URLs to share in messaging apps or as an easy way to revisit the chats later. Regardless, the public discoverability option is gone now.\nIn Fast Company's report, Stuckey defended the feature's labeling as \"sufficiently clear.\" But after the outcry grew, OpenAI relented. \"Ultimately, we think this feature introduced too many opportunities for folks to accidentally share things they didn't intend to, so we're removing the option,\" Stuckey announced on Thursday.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/openai-is-removing-chatgpt-conversations-from-google-194735704.html?src=rss",

While paid communities were meant to appeal to Reddit power users, the company still very much needs to grow its user base, according to Huffman. \"The folks previously working on user economy will join our efforts to improve the core app, including onboarding and personalization,\" the CEO explained in another AMA response. \"That gets at our most important need today, which is logged-in core user growth.\"\nWhile Huffman has spent the last year hinting at paid features, it's not hard to understand why Reddit would now be shifting away from that model. Advertising is still very much the most important part of the company's business, as Huffman explained. And adding more core users to the platform will be key to growing that business. To put this in perspective, during the last quarter, Reddit pulled in $465 million in ad revenue and just $35 million from \"other\" sources, like data licensing and Reddit premium. Even if paywalled subreddits could substantially increase that \"other\" number, it would still be a small fraction of what the company is making from advertisers.\nSo while paid subreddits may still be on the company's roadmap, users shouldn't expect to see them any time soon. They can, however, probably expect to see more ads in more places on Reddit over time. For example, Huffman said that the company sees \"ads on search return pages … as a future opportunity.\"This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/reddit-puts-its-plans-for-paid-subreddits-on-hold-181455933.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Nothing did things differently with its third generation of phones. First came the midrange Nothing Phone 3a (and 3a Pro), which combined stylish hardware with a competitive price. Now, the company has launched the Nothing Phone 3, which it's calling its first \"true flagship.\" At $799, it's Nothing's most expensive phone yet, featuring a bigger screen, four 50-megapixel cameras and a major redesign of the company’s signature Glyph interface, which has evolved into the more compact Glyph Matrix.\nNothing's hardware design is what truly sets its phones apart from the established players, and the 2025 model is more elaborate and complex than ever. At this price, however, it faces stiff competition from entry-level flagships like the Galaxy S25 and iPhone 16. Beyond the innovations and occasional gimmicks, has Nothing nailed the fundamentals enough to compete? \n\n\nHardware and design\n\n\n\n\n  Image by Mat Smith for Engadget\n \n\nOnce again, Nothing has made a phone that commands attention like no other. Everywhere I go, people are curious when they see me using the Phone 3, and the Glyph Matrix seems to both confuse and delight them.\nUnlike the protruding camera unit on the Nothing Phone 3a Pro, the Phone 3’s three cameras are separately lodged in the back and jut out a fraction of a millimeter. The see-through exterior returns, displaying screws and hardware modules organized into three vertical rows. This time, it’s more apparent that this is a design flourish rather than a genuine glimpse into the phone’s components. For example, a curious semi-circle of frosted glass beneath the flash doesn't seem to have a purpose (beyond an aesthetic one).\nElsewhere, a red square next to the ultrawide camera now acts as a recording light. It's another charming touch that can be disabled in the settings if you find it distracting. The off-center telephoto camera lens might also irk symmetry fans, but it's a choice that I don't particularly mind. The Phone 3 is 18 percent thinner than the Phone 2 and, without the camera bump of the 3a Pro, it looks and feels a step above its predecessors.\nThe main attraction is the Glyph Matrix: a circular dot-matrix display made of 489 LEDs that shows simple notifications, the time and battery level. While some loyal fans might miss the bold light show of previous models, this iteration is far more useful. Instead of a barrage of flashing lights, the Matrix can tell you who is calling through unique patterns and, with future updates, custom art assigned to your contacts.\nNothing continues to lean into its retro tech design inspiration, and I'll admit I'm a sucker for it. The dot-matrix text and numbers align perfectly with Nothing's Android skin, making the entire device feel cohesive. A capacitive haptic Glyph button beneath the Matrix lets you cycle through notifications and tools. Interactions are simple: a short press to switch modes or a long press to start tools like the stopwatch.\n\n\n\n\n  Image by Mat Smith for Engadget\n \n\nFortunately, you can use the Phone 3’s settings menu to assign Glyph Matrix tools and \"toys.\" Most of them are playful and frivolous, like Spin The Bottle and Magic 8 Ball, and Nothing is tapping into its community to create new Matrix widgets. Hopefully, functionality will expand as more users get involved. Some tools are less useful though, like a level that uses the phone’s accelerometer for a pixelated readout. It just seems a little imprecise; how much accuracy can you derive from less than 500 pixels? Others are quite slick, like a pixelated camera readout for framing selfies.\nWith Essential Notifications, you can assign specific app notifications or contacts to a unique pattern or a pixelated photo. However, it's challenging to create anything that doesn't look like a blurry mess. The same settings menu allows you to adjust the Matrix's brightness and how long the notifications persist.\nThe front of the Phone 3 is all display, with a 6.67-inch screen and a resolution of 2,800 x 1,260. If you prefer a large screen, this is probably its biggest advantage over the iPhone 16 and Galaxy S25. It’s also Nothing’s brightest phone yet, reaching up to 4,500 nits for HDR content — noticeably brighter than the Nothing Phone 3a. It supports HDR 10+ and a 120Hz refresh rate, all protected by Gorilla Glass 7.\nCameras\n\n\n\n\n  Image by Mat Smith for Engadget\n \n\nNothing has the fundamentals covered with the Phone 3’s cameras. The triple-camera system includes a 50-megapixel f/1.7 main sensor with optical image stabilization, a 50MP ultrawide and a new 50MP telephoto camera with 3x optical zoom.\nAs we noted in our Nothing Phone 3a review, telephoto cameras are rare on more affordable smartphones. On the Phone 3, there’s a periscope zoom, keeping the camera unit svelte and barely protruding from the device. It’s also impressive to see a 3x zoom paired with a high-resolution 50-megapixel sensor, which allows you to crop into images while retaining fidelity. Nothing even added a 6x zoom button in the camera app that crops the image further. The app also uses pixel-binning for more accurate color and better low-light pictures by default, which results in them being saved as 12-megapixel images.\nOverall, the camera system can be a little inconsistent. During a vacation in Amsterdam, the Phone 3 captured crisp images of wildlife and architecture. Its Action mode was particularly impressive, effortlessly adding motion blur to shots while keeping the subject sharp. However, at other times, what should have been vibrant cityscape shots and street art came out muted and grainy. For example, psychedelic cat artwork that was incredibly vibrant in person looked flat in the photos. The metadata revealed the phone had cranked up the ISO, a setting I haven't had to manually adjust on a smartphone in years.While some color variation between the three lenses is expected, images often looked as if they were taken on different phones, something that was especially evident in scenes with blue skies.\n\n\n\n\n  Image by Mat Smith for Engadget\n \n\nThe telephoto camera is the standout feature on the Phone 3. I love the ability to play with zoom, and the 3x optical zoom (plus the additional crop) makes this a more useful camera than those on the iPhone 16 or Pixel 9, which top out at 2x zoom. It’s also an excellent macro camera, using the zoom to prevent the phone from casting a shadow on the subject.\n\nSoftware\n\n\n\n\n  Image by Mat Smith for Engadget\n \n\nNothing once again outfits its phone with its own distinctive Android skin. The aesthetic is all monochrome, serif fonts and dot-matrix touches. I immediately chose this skin when setting up the phone for the first time, though finding some app icons can be more challenging without their original colors.\nEssential Space, with its dedicated hardware button, remains Nothing’s most interesting software addition. Since launching on the Nothing Phone 3a, it can now add events to your Google Calendar, remind you of tasks and summarize audio recordings. My biggest issue, however, is accidentally hitting the power button instead of the Essential Key, or vice versa. The keys need to be a different size or at least have a more distinct feel.\nPerformance and battery life\n\nWith a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8s Gen 4 processor, the Phone 3 performs solidly, but it’s not as snappy as a device with true flagship silicon, like the Snapdragon 8 Elite or Apple A18. Some might argue that the Phone 3 isn't a \"true flagship\" because its processor can be found in sub-$400 devices, but the chip is still powerful enough for most tasks and games, and can even deliver ray-traced graphics.\nNothing opted for a 5,150mAh silicon-carbon battery, making it one of the first phones we’ve tested with this new technology. It can store more lithium ions than traditional lithium-ion batteries, which Nothing claims adds a 10 percent boost in energy density compared to its predecessor. I didn’t feel any notable difference of the Phone 3 running cooler, however. In our battery rundown test, the Phone 3 was able to play a video file for just over 23 hours. That falls slightly shy of the Phone 2, but that has a smaller screen.\nThe Phone 3 also gets flagship-level charging speeds, supporting 65W wired charging that gets the device from empty to full in under an hour (with a compatible charger). It also supports 15W wireless charging and reverse wireless charging for earbuds. However, the lack of Qi2 support seems like an oversight for a \"true flagship.\"\n\nWrap-up\n\n\n\n\n  Image by Mat Smith for Engadget\n \n\nHow does Nothing’s flagship phone stack up against similarly priced smartphones? The Phone 3 offers a big 6.67-inch screen, a large battery with fast charging and 256GB of storage — double the amount found in the base Pixel 9 and Galaxy S25.\nHowever, a less-than-flagship chipset and inconsistent camera performance detract from the appeal of an otherwise intriguing phone with slick software and a unique design. The Glyph Matrix is much more useful than the flashing lights of the Phone 3’s predecessors, even if the design isn’t quite as bold. I just hope the company continues to evolve the tools available on it.\nThe Phone 3 is a much better phone than the two-year-old Nothing Phone 2, but it's also $200 more expensive, making any shortcomings more apparent. While I want Nothing to continue experimenting with its phones, it should probably prioritize shoring up the camera performance first.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/nothing-phone-3-review-143006151.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Digital storefront Itch.io is reindexing its free adult games, and is talking to its partnered payment processors about plans to gradually reintroduce paid NSFW content. In a new Developer Update, the company said the decision will ensure it can \"confidently support the widest range of creators in the long term.\"\nItch.io has instructed developers and creators who want their games back on the store to tick a “no payments” box that sits in the pricing section of a game’s edit page. It adds that any game that uses \"individually priced files” will have those files converted into free content by checking the box. The company is also introducing a new content warnings system for NSFW-tagged pages, which it says all page owners are required to update accordingly before being reindexed.\nItch.io says it has talked to one of its long-standing payment processors, Stripe, about its policies on explicit adult content, and said it will no longer be able to take payments for games deemed to be \"designed for sexual gratification\" via the platform. This is due to new restrictions enforced by Stripe’s banking partners. In a statement included in the Itch.io update, Stripe said it hasn’t closed the door on the possibility of being able to support adult content again in the future. In the meantime, Itch.io says it is talking to its other payment partners about accepting the card payments Stripe is currently no longer able to process.\nThe future of adult content on Itch.io appears to be uncertain. It was only last week that all NSFW games on the platform were deindexed and hidden, following the new payment processor policies. The sudden and frustratingly vague rules Steam and Itch.io introduced to remain in compliance with those payment processors have resulted in unjust casualties. This week, solo developer Cara Cadaver told Engadget that her game, VILE: Exhumed, has been removed from and banned by Steam on the basis of it having scenes of \"sexual content with depictions of real people,\" a description she says is not accurate. VILE: Exhumed is a mainly text-based game, and has been well received in previews, landing a spot on Six One Indie’s Best of PAX East roundup back in May. Steam’s decision to remove the game is not eligible for appeal.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/itchio-starts-reindexing-free-nsfw-content-152431716.html?src=rss",
