It might seem like an odd place to fall short, given the wide range of AI coding tools already publicly available – but with benchmarks becoming too easy, many critics see projects like the K Prize as a necessary step toward solving AI’s growing evaluation problem. “I’m quite bullish about building new tests for existing benchmarks,” says Princeton researcher Sayash Kapoor, who put forward a similar idea in a recent paper. “If we can’t even get more than 10% on a contamination free SWE-Bench, that’s the reality check for me.”"

Alongside xAI’s DOD funding, the company announced that “Grok for Government” had been added to the General Services Administration schedule, meaning that xAI products are now available for purchase across every government office and agency. “The right question is this: would they ban Grok, the AI they just signed a large contract with, because it has been deliberately engineered to give politically charged answers?” Lemley said in an email interview. In some cases, an overabundance of caution among developers and AI trained on internet content that promotes values like inclusivity have led to distorted model outputs. Chowdhury says her biggest fear with this executive order is that AI companies will actively rework training data to tow the party line. Achieving unbiased or neutral results is impossible, especially in today’s world where even facts are politicized."

These state-sponsored savings plans allow relatives and other individuals to put aside money for a child's education and come with tax benefits like tax-free withdrawals if the money is used for educational expenses. You could also consider a low-risk government-backed investment like an I bond, which can preserve your purchasing power in the face of inflation. Retirement accounts like 401(k)s and IRAs are designed to help you maximize your tax advantages. While brief stock market swings can cause panic, investing is still critical for long-term financial stability. The S&P 500 has historically delivered an annual return of about 10% for investors who stick it out over decades. Instead of trying to beat the market, focus more on your ideal investing strategy."

Many variables exist (including the internet connection type), so when you sign up for internet service, you shouldn't assume AT&T will always be your fastest option. That said, Ookla's report shows AT&T Fiber at the top of its charts, registering a median download speed of just over 363 megabits per second in tests collected by Ookla from January through June 2025. Ookla is an internet speed-test company that collects data via its Speedtest.net tool, which gathers insights from millions of daily customer uses. For example, it can help you pinpoint when and where your connection may be laggy. Many things can affect a speed test, including whether or not you're using Wi-Fi or a hardwired Ethernet connection, the time of day you're running the test and so on. It was the fastest provider in nine of the country's top 100 cities (second only to AT&T Fiber), but it didn't reach enough households to meet Ookla's mark for national inclusion. Yes, nabbing the top spot is certainly something a company like AT&T can brag about."

This growth brings YouTube’s total ad revenue to $9.8 billion, up from $8.7 billion in the same period last year. The company slightly exceeded analyst expectations, which had forecast YouTube’s Q2 ad revenue to be around $9.6 billion. For years, YouTube has been striving to capture a larger share of television ad dollars, especially as its popularity on TV has grown, accounting for a significant portion of its viewership. A recent report from Nielsen indicated that YouTube held the largest share of TV viewing for three consecutive months, representing 12.4% of the total audience time spent watching television. In response to YouTube’s success, rival streaming services, such as HBO Max and Amazon Prime Video, have ramped up their advertising strategies, increasing ad placements to stimulate growth. Additionally, Netflix is emerging as a key competitor to YouTube, particularly after it announced its intentions to double its advertising revenue within the year during the company’s earnings call last week. Although Netflix has not publicly disclosed its ad revenue figures, an analyst from Madison & Wall estimates that it’s around $3 billion. Overall, Alphabet reported strong results, with total revenue of $96.4 billion in the second quarter, representing a 13% year-over-year increase."

    "summary": "After largely focusing Google I/O 2025 on the ways the company wants Gemini to change everything from searching the web to filmmaking, Google is finally ready to launch new hardware. The next Made by Google event is on the books for August 20, and Google has already confirmed what at least one of its new Pixel 10 phones will look like.\nAs in past years, Google isn't the only source for information on its new phones and wearables. Nearly all the new hardware the company is expected to announce has leaked in one form or another ahead of the event. With that in mind and after sifting through what's leaked, here's what Google is likely to show off at the Pixel 10 launch event in New York City on August 20.\nPixel 10, 10 Pro, 10 Pro XL and 10 Pro Fold\nAndroid Headlines / Onleaks \nGoogle's invitation for the event says that the company is sharing \"the latest on our Pixel phones, watches, buds and more,” which more or less confirms the company will introduce a slate of products that's similar to what it launched in 2024. That means a Pixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro, Pixel 10 Pro XL and Pixel 10 Pro Fold are absolutely on the menu.\nGoogle's tease of the Pixel 10 confirmed what leaked renders have already signaled: the company isn't abandoning the new design language the Pixel 9 established. The pill-shaped camera bump and flat front display will still be present on the Pixel 10, and the real changes will be in the details, like for example, how the flat sides of the Pixel 10 join with the phone's back.\nThose subtle changes will apparently also include the thickness of the Pixel 10s. While both the Pixel 10, 10 Pro, 10 Pro XL and 10 Pro Fold will use the same sized OLED screens as their Pixel 9 counterparts, they'll be housed in thicker and heavier bodies, according to Android Headlines. Google's new Pixels are also supposed to come in new colors. The Pixel 10 will come in \"Frost\" (a royal blue), \"Lemongrass\" (a yellow), \"Indigo\" (a light purple) and \"Obsidian\" (a dark gray), while the Pixel 10 Pro / Pro XL will come in Obsidian, \"Porcelain\" (off-white), \"Moonstone\" (a bluish gray) and \"Jade\" (a light green). Less information is known about the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, though recent leaks suggest it'll come in Moonstone and Jade, as well.\nAndroid Headlines\nThe most visible external change that'll be introduced on the Pixel 10 is the addition of a new telephoto camera. The new telephoto camera is a 11-megapixel 5x telephoto, Android Authority reports, similar to the one on the Pixel 9 Pro Fold. Meanwhile, the Pixel 10 Pro and 10 Pro XL are expected to feature a 50-megapixel wide, 48-megapixel ultrawide, 48-megapixel telephoto and 48-megapixel selfie cameras. The Pixel 10 Pro Fold could feature a different lineup, with a similar main camera, but 12-megapixel ultrawide and telephoto cameras, and 11-megapixel selfie cameras.\nInside the new phones, Google is laying the groundwork for future performance gains with a new Tensor G5 chip. It's likely be much more power-efficient thanks to the company switching to a 3nm design produced by TSMC. Reports suggest the chip might not be all that different in terms of raw power, but the Tensor G5 is likely designed to be extra capable when it comes to using local AI features.\nPixel Watch 4\n91mobiles / Onleaks\nThe third time was the charm for the Pixel Watch 3, so the main task Google has with the Pixel Watch 4 is to not squander the solid base it already has. Leaks for the company's new smartwatches have been limited so far, but renders of the Pixel Watch 4 shared by 91mobiles do suggest Google has a few changes planned.\nNamely, much like the company's phones, the new Pixel Watch seems like it'll be a little bit thicker and come with smaller bezels. The Pixel Watch 4 should be available to purchase in the same 41mm and 45mm sizes as before, but a thicker frame that could accommodate a larger battery, or a new wireless charging system. Notably, the renders are missing the charging pins used on the Pixel Watch 3.\nBeyond that, Google has already indicated how Wear OS is evolving. The new Wear OS 6 update is debuting on the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8, and will presumably be available on the Pixel Watch 4 at launch. It includes built-in access to Gemini, among other tweaks. Given Google also manages the Fitbit Premium subscription, it wouldn't be all that surprising if the Pixel Watch 4 gets some exclusive fitness tracking features, too.\nPixel Buds 2a\nBilly Steele for Engadget\nGoogle launched the Pixel Buds Pro 2 last year, and it typically doesn't update its premium earbuds on a yearly cadence. So instead, Tom's Guide reports Google might pair the Pixel 10 with the Pixel Buds Pro 2 in a new color, and save its new hardware announcements for a sequel to the Pixel Buds A-series called the Pixel Buds 2a.\nUnlike the company's premium wireless earbuds, the A-series Pixel Buds have historically skimped on things like active noise cancellation to hit a lower price. There's little reporting on where Google will take the Pixel Buds 2a, but you can expect the new earbuds to come in some of the new colors being introduced on the Pixel 10.\nPixelsnap\nThe Qi2 wireless charging standard is available for all phone makers to use, but it hasn't been widely adopted among Android phone makers. Qi2 uses magnets to offer improved charging speeds, just like Apple's MagSafe, and the Pixel 10 could mark Google's adoption of Qi2 through a new feature called \"Pixelsnap.\"\nA report from Android Authority suggests the Pixel 10 will include the necessary magnets to make Qi2 happen, and will be introduced alongside a lineup of Pixelsnap accessories. Adding some weight to the report, the Wireless Power Consortium has announced that its faster Qi2 25W charging is coming to \"major Android phones.\" It would make sense if Google's Pixel 10s were included.\nGemini and other exclusive software features\nGemini is Google's current favorite, and the company is pushing the AI assistant everywhere it makes sense. The last few Pixel Drops — Google's regular Pixel-focused software updates — have primarily included Gemini features. It would make sense for Google to include a few more software exclusives on the Pixel 10.\nGoogle is hosting the Pixel 10 launch event on August 20 at 1PM ET / 10AM ET. The company has invited press to attend in person, and you can read coverage of everything Google announces right here on Engadget.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/what-to-expect-at-the-google-pixel-10-launch-event-on-august-20-214510264.html?src=rss",
    "full_text": "The next Made by Google event is on the books for August 20 , and Google has already confirmed what at least one of its new Pixel 10 phones will look like. As in past years, Google isn't the only source for information on its new phones and wearables. With that in mind and after sifting through what's leaked, here's what Google is likely to show off at the Pixel 10 launch event in New York City on August 20. Reports suggest the chip might not be all that different in terms of raw power, but the Tensor G5 is likely designed to be extra capable when it comes to using local AI features. Leaks for the company's new smartwatches have been limited so far, but renders of the Pixel Watch 4 shared by 91mobiles do suggest Google has a few changes planned. Beyond that, Google has already indicated how Wear OS is evolving. Google launched the Pixel Buds Pro 2 last year, and it typically doesn't update its premium earbuds on a yearly cadence. Qi2 uses magnets to offer improved charging speeds, just like Apple's MagSafe, and the Pixel 10 could mark Google's adoption of Qi2 through a new feature called \"Pixelsnap.\" It would make sense for Google to include a few more software exclusives on the Pixel 10.

Carr’s proposal argues that this is a flawed way to measure progress toward closing the digital divide. It all hinges on one key sentence used in Section 706: “The Commission shall determine whether advanced telecommunications capability is being deployed to all Americans in a reasonable and timely fashion.” Carr’s proposal argues that the FCC has been (wrongly) measuring where broadband has been deployed already, not where it is in the process of being deployed. “That interpretation seemingly found anything short of 100% was insufficient to warrant a passing grade and thus disregarded Congress's use of the present progressive tense in ‘is being deployed.’” Section 706 requires that if broadband is not being deployed to all Americans, the FCC must “accelerate deployment of such capability by removing barriers to infrastructure investment and by promoting competition.” It says that the previous FCC read “several extraneous universal service criteria” into section 706. Most broadband experts agree that cost is the main reason people don’t have home internet, not a lack of availability."

In addition, Google’s Gemini app has grown to 450 million monthly active users. “We continue to see strong growth and engagement with daily requests growing over 50% from Q1,” Pichai said of the app. Meanwhile, AI Mode — a way to use Google Search via an AI chat experience to get more in-depth answers — has over 100 million monthly active users, Pichai said. On the developer front, Google said more than 9 million have built with Gemini and over 70 million videos have been produced with the Veo 3 AI model since May. The stats are meant to illustrate consumer demand for AI features. For instance, Google shared that AI Overviews were driving over 10% more Google Search queries, for the types of searches that show them. Across Google’s platform and products, Google quantified its growth by monthly tokens processed, saying that it had announced at its developer conference in May that it had processed 480 trillion monthly tokens, and that figure has now doubled to 980 trillion monthly tokens. “We are seeing significant demand for our comprehensive AI product portfolio,” Pichai told investors. “Of course, this is all possible because of the long-term investments we have made in our differentiated, full-stack approach to AI.”"

After years of exponential growth, the sudden reversal in Tesla’s fortune has left many investors and supporters with whiplash. But even though he is now publicly feuding with Trump, Musk hasn’t completely backed away from his political activities. Earlier this month, he said he would create a new political party called “the America Party,” following through on his threat to challenge Republicans who supported Trump’s budget bill. After that happens, Tesla’s sales are predicted to drop even more.

    "summary": "At its best, AI is a tool, not an end result. It allows people to do their jobs better, rather than sending them or their colleagues to the breadline. In an example of \"the good kind,\" Google DeepMind has created an AI model that restores and contextualizes ancient inscriptions. Aeneas (no, it's not pronounced like that) is named after the hero in Roman mythology. Best of all, the tool is open-source and free to use.\nAncient Romans left behind a plethora of inscriptions. But these texts are often fragmented, weathered or defaced. Rebuilding the missing pieces is a grueling task that requires contextual cues. An algorithm that can pore over a dataset of those cues can come in handy.\nAeneas speeds up one of historians' most difficult tasks: identifying \"parallels.\" In this setting, that means finding similar texts arranged by wording, syntax or region. DeepMind says the model reasons across thousands of Latin inscriptions. It can fetch parallels in seconds before passing the baton back to historians.\nDeepMind says it turns each text into a historical fingerprint of sorts. \"Aeneas identifies deep connections that can help historians situate inscriptions within their broader historical context,\" the Google subsidiary wrote.\nGoogle DeepMind\nOne of Aeneas' most impressive tricks is restoring textual gaps of unknown length. (Think of it as filling out a crossword puzzle where you don't know how many letters are in each clue.) The tool is also multimodal, meaning it can analyze both textual and visual input. DeepMind says it's the first model that can use that multi-pronged method to figure out where a text came from.\nDeepMind says Aeneas is designed to be a collaborative ally within historians' existing workflows. It's best used to offer \"interpretable suggestions\" that serve as a starting point for researchers. \"Aeneas' parallels completely changed my perception of the inscription,\" an unnamed historian who tested the model wrote. \"It noticed details that made all the difference for restoring and chronologically attributing the text.\"\nAlongside the release of Aeneas for Latin text, DeepMind also upgraded Ithaca. (That's its model for Ancient Greek text.) Ithaca is now powered by Aeneas, receiving its contextual and restorative superpowers.\nResearchers can take Aeneas for a spin at DeepMind's \"Predicting the Past\" website. It also open-sourced the model's code and dataset.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/google-deepminds-aeneas-model-can-restore-fragmented-latin-text-202004714.html?src=rss",

    "full_text": "Got some subscriptions on an Apple device you're looking to cancel? You might be in for an extra step in the near future -- or a deal you decide you can't pass up. I don't know about you, but often when I'm trying cancel a subscription (like Starz, when Outlander isn't airing), I get an offer to stick around for a temporarily discounted price. It can be annoying sometimes, but I'd be lying if I said I've never taken them up on the deal. However you feel about that common customer retention practice, you can expect to see it on your Apple devices in the near future, according to findings from 9to5Mac. Spotted in the company's App Store documentation, developers now have a few options for presenting you with a further message whenever you attempt to end a subscription, including messages encouraging you to consider a different price tier, or a message offering you a promotional discount. At that point in the process, you'll still have the standard \"Confirm Cancellation\" and \"Don't Cancel\" options available to you, so no need to worry about further complications to cancellation beyond this extra decision. It comes just after the US Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals struck down the Federal Trade Commission's \"Click to Cancel\" rule, which sought to make cancelling subscriptions as simple as the push of one button. The rule might make a comeback soon, as the ruling was only because the FTC had not undertaken the necessary regulatory analysis for a move that would have an impact on the US economy greater than $1 million. Apple did not respond to CNET's request for comment prior to publication."

I should note that I performed this testing a couple days before T-Satellite went live, so it was technically during the T-Satellite beta period, and using a beta version of the Messages app on Android. The only difference over satellite is that it took around two and a half minutes to send. T-Mobile has cited AllTrails as an example of apps that'll be compatible with the service. But at one point after sending a message, some text below it said the app was waiting to connect. I also ran into some confusion with my iPhone 16 Pro running T-Satellite as a secondary eSIM. On further research, I discovered that an active third-party satellite connection shows \"SAT\" in the menu bar. Will satellite services cover the remaining dead zones and allow easy communication even in remote areas? As companies build up the capacity and performance of satellite services, it's easy to see a near future where you don't have to think about how you're getting data, just as we currently don't ever think about which cellular tower is relaying our data. As someone who lives in cellular-saturated Seattle, I probably won't need to rely on satellite data."

    "full_text": "There are a ton of laptops on the market at any given moment and almost all of those models are available in multiple configurations to match your performance and budget needs. If you're feeling overwhelmed with options when looking for a new laptop, it's understandable. When deciding on a screen, there are a myriad number of considerations: How much you need to display (which is surprisingly more about resolution than screen size), what types of content you'll be looking at and whether you'll be using it for gaming or creative work. You can always make things bigger on a high-resolution screen, but you can never make them smaller -- to fit more content in the view -- on a low-resolution screen. There are some games and creative software that won't run unless they detect a dGPU or sufficient VRAM. For memory, I highly recommend 16GB of RAM (8GB absolute minimum). Most manufacturers disclose this but if the RAM type is LPDDR, assume it's soldered and can't be upgraded. Some PC makers will solder memory on and also leave an empty internal slot for adding a stick of RAM. Not all SSDs are equally speedy, and cheaper laptops typically have slower drives; if the laptop only has 4GB or 8GB of RAM, it may end up swapping to that drive and the system may slow down quickly while you're working. The one exception is gaming laptops: I don't recommend going with less than a 512GB SSD unless you really like uninstalling games every time you want to play a new game."

AI can easily create songs and imitate certain styles, but in addition to copyright issues, that creates legal problems when AI pretends to be an existing artist. It's not clear what Syntax Error is exactly, but it's certainly not Blaze Foley, who was killed in 1989. There are also reports that fake songs have appeared under the profiles of other real artists in Spotify, like Guy Clark. \"This violates Spotify's policies and is not allowed. It seems like Spotify relies on third parties to prevent songs from being uploaded to the wrong artist profile, but questions remain on how this process works. Fans may soon have to start double-checking when a new song drops from popular artists they follow: Is it an AI fake or the real deal from a favorite band? Craig McDonald, the owner of Lost Art Records, confirmed to CNET that the track was not performed or written by Blaze.

Since it was released in October 2023, the game has sold more than 11 million copies worldwide. With its joyous platformer gameplay and signature PlayStation character cameos, Astro Bot is a critically acclaimed standout that should please many gamers."

There are certainly some characters lacking in-depth and the planetside procedurally generated exploration wears thin fast, but anyone looking for a solid sci-fi first-person looter shooter will find themself at home in Starfield's galaxy. You could just as easily oppress nearby settlements or build a strong isolationist fortress to keep strangers out. If you're interested in the logistics behind keeping a community standing, State of Decay 2 has that covered. He's a symbol of hope that will put his life on the line if it means saving even one more human being. Like No Man's Sky and Cyberpunk 2077, this game proves that years of TLC can transform a dud into an all-time great. It's also a never-ending cartoonish caper for treasure and adventure that encourages you to get in touch with your inner swashbuckler. Continual support for Minecraft has added new items, biomes and mobs each year since its original release way back in 2009. These games often have a higher frame rate, auto HDR and improved screen resolution when played on the Xbox Series X. Picking out the best Xbox Series X/S game is subjective and answers will vary according to each gamer's preferences."

    "full_text": "That was supposed to start changing under former President Joe Biden’s direction. He set a goal for the US to get all its electricity from carbon pollution-free sources by 2035. If it had stayed intact, the law was expected to reduce US greenhouse gas emissions by around 40 percent this decade. But Trump is making it harder to build those projects in the US. The bill will likely decrease electricity generation capacity in 2035 by 340 GW, according to one analysis, with the vast majority of losses coming from solar and wind farms that will no longer get built. Even if AI models become more efficient over time, the amount of electricity they’re currently projected to demand could lock communities across the US into prolonged reliance on fossil fuels as utilities build out new gas infrastructure. Zeldin also writes that when it comes to Clean Air Act permits for polluters it considers “minor emitters,” the EPA will only meet “minimum requirements for public participation.” An AI Action Plan that the White House dropped on July 23rd proposes creating new categorical exclusions for data center-related projects from the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), a sunshine law that mandates input from local communities on major federal projects. There are other factors at play that could derail Trump’s fossil-fueled agenda, including a backlog for gas turbines in high demand. But so far, things are shaping up differently in the real world. “There’s no question right now that AI is driving greater fossil fuel use in the United States and really setting us back in terms of climate change,” says Cathy Kunkel, an energy consultant at IEEFA."

Gurman did say in his post that Apple could release the public beta \"around\" July 23, which could mean Thursday or Friday. So public beta testers could get to experience new iOS 26 features, like Liquid Glass and backgrounds in Messages, before the weekend. That means the update might be buggy and your device's battery life may be affected so it's best to keep those troubles off your primary device. If you want to try the beta, I recommend downloading it on a secondary device. You should also know iOS 26 is only compatible with devices newer than the iPhone 11. So if you have an iPhone XR -- like I do -- you can't download the developer or public beta of iOS 26.

The company also reported that in June, 1 million Teen Accounts reported or blocked accounts, and another 1 million used the Location Notice feature to see if an account messaging them was in a different country. Just last year, bombshell accusations emerged from a memoir by a Meta whistleblower, claiming that the company served ads to teenagers based on their emotional states. Meta denied those claims but has taken steps in recent years to offer improved safety features for underage users on its platforms, built around new \"Teen Accounts,\" which limit the ability of young users to be contacted and to see certain content. Meta will also be rolling out similar protections for accounts run by adults that share a great deal of content related to children, such as those who post pictures and videos of their children, and accounts for children managed by their parents. The blog post explained that while such accounts \"are overwhelmingly used in benign ways, unfortunately there are people who may try to abuse them, leaving sexualized comments under their posts or asking for sexual images in DMs.\""

YC laid off most of the folks putting on this event between a small layoff about a year ago and a larger one in 2023. These layoffs were surprising at the time because Y Combinator’s events have always been highly popular and were a major force in making San Francisco the hub for the burgeoning AI startup community. (Of course, the center of that universe is YC-affiliated OpenAI, also headquartered in San Francisco and run by former YC president Sam Altman.) The people putting on this event are doing it because they are appalled at how often early-stage startups are led to believe they must pay tens of thousands of dollars to hire PR and social media agencies, one person involved told TechCrunch. Still, in the wake of startups that routinely go viral, like Cluely, founders feel pressured to do the same. It’s also true that a single social media post can make an early-stage startup go viral these days. The founders of app vibe coding startup Rork were almost broke when a viral tweet led them to raise $2.8 million and nab a spot in a16z’s Speedrun program. Defense tech startup Theseus landed a contract with the U.S. Special Forces, $4.3 million in funding, and a spot in YC, from a viral X post.

    "full_text": "is The Verge’s senior AI reporter. The White House unveiled its long-awaited “AI Action Plan” on Wednesday, and it included a zombie: a resurrected form of the controversial AI law moratorium that died a very public death. The failed congressional moratorium would have stipulated that no state could regulate artificial intelligence systems for a 10-year period, on pain of being barred from a $500 million AI development fund and potentially losing rural broadband funding. It states that “AI is far too important to smother in bureaucracy at this early stage” and that the government “should not allow AI-related Federal funding to be directed toward states with burdensome AI regulations that waste these funds,” though it should also “not interfere with states’ rights to pass prudent laws that are not unduly restrictive to innovation.” The White House’s Office of Management and Budget will work with federal agencies that have “AI-related discretionary funding programs to ensure, consistent with applicable law, that they consider a state’s AI regulatory climate when making funding decisions and limit funding if the state’s AI regulatory regimes may hinder the effectiveness of that funding or award.” Essentially, states that do choose to enforce their own AI regulations may be punished for it on a federal level, under a different sort of AI law moratorium — one with, as described in this plan, no expiration date. More detail about Trump’s plan — which encourages rapid adoption of AI tech and expansion of AI infrastructure, as well as attempts to root out diversity and climate science in AI systems used by the government — will come in a series of executive orders this week. The congressional moratorium initially passed the House of Representatives, but it was largely condemned by Democrats and divisive among some Republicans. Some industry activists believed it would prohibit not just new AI regulation, but data privacy, facial recognition, and other tech-related rules in states like Washington and Colorado. After an intense 24-hour period of lobbying and back-door dealmaking — including 45 rounds of votes — 99 out of 100 senators voted for the moratorium’s exclusion from Trump’s funding bill."

On Wednesday, Microsoft backtracked on the price increase for The Outer Worlds 2. The game now costs $70, which itself was considered outrageous only a few years ago.\nMicrosoft told Windows Central that those who already pre-ordered Obsidian's shooter at $80 can get refunds at the point of purchase. Unfortunately, you can't simply get a $10 price adjustment. You'll have to refund the full $80 and then pre-order again for $70. I'm beginning to think consumer-friendliness isn't the priority here.\nThe $80 pricing push began with Mario Kart World. Comments by Gearbox CEO Randy Pitchford initially suggested Borderlands 4 might have followed. Fortunately, 2K Games saw something in the backlash that made it balk; it's launching at $70. A Bluesky user summed it up in a reply to Obsidian's U-turn. \"Consumer advocacy in this awful state of the industry WORKS,\" ‪@johnbrebbia posted.\nNintendo\nThe gaming industry is caught in a godawful whirlwind of layoffs, studio closures and price increases. That's happening against a backdrop of rising costs for consumers. Meanwhile, the gaming industry is projected to reach $189 billion this year, a 3.4 percent increase. That's a combustible mixture if ever there was one.\nIronically, Obsidian's sci-fi RPG deals with themes of late-stage capitalism.

The organization on Wednesday announced it’s launching a campaign that introduces banners inside its Android and iOS apps, prompting users to make a monetary donation. These banners will be easy to dismiss, Mastodon says, and will only be shown to people who have accounts that have existed for at least four weeks. The organization promises that it won’t continually prompt users to donate, either. Such campaigns can work well for nonprofit organizations at scale. Still, the banners could encourage people who haven’t actively sought out ways to contribute to now do so, as it makes the process more seamless as an in-app feature. The latter would allow individual server admins to receive direct support from their own users, which could help keep them operational. It has also accepted a handful of donations from open source-focused funds and foundations over the years. That decline could have pushed it to look into more aggressive fundraising tactics, especially as competition from Meta and newcomers like the VC-backed startup Bluesky is growing. “We know that collecting money can present complexities and questions,” a Mastodon blog post stated."

While some streaming devices like Fire TV Stick and Apple TV offer native support for VPN apps, allowing you to download the VPN app directly to the device, Roku devices do not. Although not nearly as straightforward as downloading the VPN app directly to your device, getting a VPN set up on Roku is relatively easy -- and there’s a good chance that you already have the necessary equipment to make it work. Alternatively, you can share a mobile hotspot from your Windows or Mac computer. However, even though many VPNs have tutorials on how to do this on a variety of router models, it can still be a tricky process and probably risky to try if you’re not particularly technically inclined. If you’re an ExpressVPN user, you can purchase its Aircove router, which comes in a portable version for $170 or a standard size for $190. Simply connect your Roku or any other device (whether it supports VPN apps or not) to your VPN router network and you’re good to go. Using one of the methods outlined above, most any VPN would technically work with your Roku device. If you want the best VPN for streaming overall, ExpressVPN is a great option. If you’re on a budget, Surfshark and Private Internet Access are both excellent choices because they deliver premium VPN performance at wallet-friendly prices."

    "summary": "2024 was an awful year for Sonos. Its long-awaited entry into a crowded headphones market was eclipsed by a bungled app launch which had a knock-on effect that impacted everything the company had planned to do for the rest of the year. Plus, those Ace headphones were missing a major feature.\nOne year later, that TrueCinema spatial audio enhancement is finally ready. And with that update, Sonos added a few more improvements to the Ace, including two-person TV Audio Swap, adaptive noise cancellation and better calls. I spent some time testing every aspect of the update that arrived in June to determine if Sonos’ headphones really are better after the tweaks.\nTrueCinema is finally here\nThe first time I tried the Ace at a press event last spring, TrueCinema was one of the main parts of the demo. From the jump, Sonos was clear this wouldn’t arrive when the headphones first went on sale, but I also didn’t expect the company to take a full year to have it ready.\nAs a refresher, TrueCinema is a feature for the Ace that takes into account the acoustics of the room where one of its soundbars is located. It then creates spatial audio for the headphones based on that info when TV Audio Swap is active. According to Sonos, it supposedly “understands the dynamics of your space, acoustically treats it and makes it sound like you have a beautifully tuned 3D audio system right in your headphones.” It’s similar to the company’s TruePlay tuning that calibrates its soundbars to your living room or home theater space.\nSonos has championed TrueCinema as a more realistic listening experience. Since it simulates the characteristics of the room, it’s supposed to make it seem like you aren’t wearing headphones at all. I’m not convinced on that point, but the feature does significantly enhance the spatial audio capabilities of the Ace for TV Audio Swap.\nFor example, subtle details in movies — things like footsteps, as well as various beeps, clicks and taps in Rogue One — are a lot more obvious with TrueCinema. There’s more overall depth and direction to the sound as well, which makes this the optimal mode for watching TV or movies with Sonos’ headphones. I’m confident my review score would’ve been higher if this was part of the original package since it makes such an obvious improvement to sound quality.\nTV Audio Swap for two\nBilly Steele for Engadget\nThe marquee feature for the Sonos Ace for the last year has been TV Audio Swap. This allows you to send the sound from a compatible Sonos soundbar to the headphones for an individual listening experience. Of course, this means you can watch an action flick at full volume after your family goes to bed or to tune in to a sporting event without annoying your partner. This has worked well for me both during my review and in the time since.\nUnfortunately, I don’t have a second pair of the Ace, so I can’t vouch for how well TV Audio Swap now works with a companion. But since the ability to send soundbar audio to two sets of Ace headphones is one of the main items in the recent software update, I can’t discuss the overall state of the device without mentioning this feature’s availability.\nImproved ANC and clearer calls\nAnother aspect of the Ace’s update is improved active noise cancellation (ANC), but not in the way you might expect. The company didn’t figure out a way to block more noise per se, but it does account for any sound leaks that may impact performance. Sonos says its refined ANC setup can adapt to changes in fit caused by hair, glasses and hats in real time using the sensors inside the Ace. With that tweak, I noticed the slightest difference in ANC performance when sunglasses or a hat kept the ear pads from sitting flush on my face, but it’s not quite as good as a tight seal. I’d characterize this update as a modest improvement, but it’s still an improvement nonetheless.\nSonos also claims that this software update offers an improved call experience thanks to higher resolution audio. The company also added Sidetone, or the ability for you to pipe in your voice during calls when ANC is enabled. Plenty of companies have this, to varying degrees, and the effectiveness depends on how natural the sound is and whether or not you’re able to make any adjustments. In the case of the Ace, Sidetone acts as an enhanced ambient mode, and it definitely improves the call experience. Since I could speak normally and didn’t feel the need to shout to hear myself, video and voice calls felt more natural.\nWrap-up\nA year after their debut, the Sonos Ace is living up to the lofty expectations the company set when the headphones arrived. After spending time with this batch of updates, I’m convinced the Ace would’ve benefitted from having all of this ready at launch, especially TrueCinema. Since one of the Ace’s main functions is personal living room listening, taking so long to deliver the feature that would boost sound quality this much is another misstep.\nOn the other hand, it’s good to see Sonos is still working to improve the Ace. When you consider the company spent most of 2024 fixing a majorly botched app redesign, it would have been understandable if Sonos left the Ace to languish until it was time for version 2.0. The company had to delay products last summer, and according to a report in March, it even canceled another entirely. When CEO Patrick Spence resigned in January, interim chief executive Tom Conrad expressed the need for “getting back to basics” (Conrad was named permanent CEO on July 23). Improving a major new product that was overshadowed by a poor run of form is certainly one way to reclaim some of your reputation. It also doesn’t hurt that the Ace is currently available for $149 less than its original $449 price.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/a-year-later-the-sonos-ace-is-finally-fulfilling-its-potential-170035355.html?src=rss",

Tying back to other Trump themes of beating China, the strategy focuses on locking out foreign tech and emphasizing security protections to keep “adversarial technology” — like Chinese-made chips and hardware — out of the U.S. supply chain. One of the recommended policy actions is to update federal procurement guidelines to ensure the government only contracts with frontier large language model developers who “ensure their systems are objective and free from top-down ideological bias.” The implications of Trump’s policy suggestion and his impending executive order, could be far-reaching. He added: “If the order instructs agencies to select AIs based on a combination of accuracy and neutrality, leaving each agency with some latitude to decide what that means, that might be more viable.” These resources are expensive and typically were only possible for tech companies that could strike million- or billion-dollar contracts with cloud providers. Under Trump’s plan, federal agencies will work together to collect intelligence on foreign frontier AI projects that could threaten American national security.

Meta’s wristband employs a technique called surface electromyography (sEMG), which detects electrical signals generated by muscle activity to interpret user movements, as explained in a research paper published in the journal Nature. These signals can sense a person’s intended actions, even before they do them. The goal of this wristband is to provide less invasive tools to interact with computers for people with motor disabilities. The company is collaborating with Carnegie Mellon to test the wristband with people who have spinal cord injuries, enabling them to use computers even if they are unable to fully use their arms or hands. Douglas Weber, a professor in the Department of Mechanical Engineering and the Neuroscience Institute, noted that even people with complete hand paralysis still exhibit some muscle activity. As a result, the device is able to interpret their intended actions. The wristband is a simpler alternative to other projects, such as Elon Musk’s Neuralink, which aims to implant brain chips in individuals with severe paralysis. Other non-invasive approaches include headsets that utilize electroencephalogram (EEG) signals; however, these have limitations due to the weak signals they produce. Meanwhile, Meta’s wristband could be used immediately without surgical intervention, and its use of sEMG signals means it operates at a higher frequency than EEG."

I've had the 12,000 BTU Windmill WhisperTech air conditioner for three years, and it keeps our master bedroom comfortable during intense temperatures. We will be testing the Windmill AC unit there this summer to see how fast it can cool a heated 92 degree Fahrenheit room and how well it can maintain 68 degrees Fahrenheit -- a tough test many AC units fail at. The Windmill air conditioner has a sleek, minimal design that many of my friends and family have commented on. The LED display lights automatically dim, so you don't have to worry about any visual disruptions at night. The Windmill app makes it easy to control settings for multiple window air conditioners in one spot."

    "summary": "My dream projector delivers the brightest and sharpest image. But it also has to be easy to move around and set up anywhere — especially outdoors. Anker’s Nebula X1 long-throw projector promises all of that with a three-laser engine that beams out a category-leading 3,500 ANSI lumens at 4K resolution. It also has features never seen before on a home projector, like liquid cooling to reduce fan noise and a motorized lens gimbal that automates setup. Plus, it offers good sound that can be upgraded with optional satellite speakers.\nThe rub is the price. At $3,000 ($3,298 with the satellite speakers for a limited time) it’s one of the more expensive consumer projectors, right up there with models like Epson’s LS11000 or the Valerion VisionMaster Pro2. After testing it, I can say that it offers the clearest, most vivid image quality I’ve seen and has the simplest setup to boot. However, the high price puts it far out of reach for most portable projector buyers. \n\n\nFeatures and design\nThe Nebula X1 follows in the footsteps of other Anker projectors, like the original Nebula and Cosmos, with a tall rectangular design and handle that neatly retracts with a press. While that makes it easy to carry, it also means the Nebula X1 hangs down more than most indoor projectors when ceiling-mounted.\nTo eliminate the tedious setup that typically plagues projectors, Anker did a clever thing: it placed the lens mechanism on a gimbal that can tilt up to 25 degrees. When combined with a 1.67x zoom, autofocus, keystone correction and ambient light detection, the projector fully automates setup. First, you have to choose a screen or wall location and position the projector at a prescribed distance between 8 and 35 feet, depending on the screen or wall size. You should center the projector as well as you can to avoid any digital (keystone) correction that can adversely affect image quality. Then the magic happens at the press of a button.\nThe Nebula X1 uses a function it calls Spatial Adaptation to scan the area in front of it. The lens tilts up and down, before displaying a checkerboard pattern and then beaming the final image pretty much precisely where it should be. It’s not perfect, as some obstacles like small plants or fine wires can throw it off, but it worked nicely for me on both a wall and dedicated screen. The projector can adapt to ambient light and even the wall color, and another function called Spatial Recall lets you save those settings for frequently used locations.\n\n\n\n  The Nebula X1's Spatial Adaptation feature in action.\n \n\n  Steve Dent for Engadget\n \n\nLaser engines get hot and are normally cooled with fans that can generate distracting noise. However, the Nebula X1 is the first consumer model with liquid cooling which reduces fan noise to a barely audible 26dB whisper. Thanks to this cooling system, the projector can also have a smaller footprint. That’s a big quality-of-life improvement compared to much of the competition.\nAs for inputs, the X1 comes with two HDMI 2.1 ports, including one with Enhanced Audio Return Channel (eARC) functionality. That standard supports fast refresh rates of up to 240Hz at 4K, though the X1 tops out at 4K 60Hz so it’s not ideal as a gaming projector. It also offers USB Type-A and USB Type-C ports, along with a S/PDIF optical audio port.\nGoogle TV is built in for streaming and projector control. It provides a large library of apps via Google Play along with a familiar interface. You also get Netflix’s official application with support for 4K Dolby Vision without the need to plug in a streaming device, plus Chromecast support and Google Assistant for voice control. The downside is that it can occasionally be sluggish, particularly with menu settings like projector image control.\nImage quality\n\n\n\n\n  Steve Dent for Engadget\n \n\nAnker uses what it calls “cinema-grade glass” in the Nebula’s 14-element lens to increase brightness, color accuracy and lens durability. The 4K triple laser engine is rated at up to 3,500 ANSI lumens with a 5,000:1 contrast ratio. At the same time, it offers color accuracy with a Delta E value of less than 0.8 and an impressive 110 percent of the Rec.2020 color spectrum, matching high-end ultra short throw (UST) models from Samsung, LG and Formovie. That 4K Dolby Vision support I mentioned is also rare among the competition.\nThe result is the sharpest and brightest image I’ve seen on any projector in this price range. It was bright enough for me to comfortably watch a soccer match on a sunny day without the shades lowered. And if you switch it to Conference mode, you can ramp the brightness up further for a viewable image even with lights on, but there’s the downside of a slight blue color cast.\nWhen used in a darkened room or outside at night, the Nebula’s image quality is the best of any projector I’ve tested. Even though it uses the same Texas Instruments 0.47-inch DMD (digital mirror device) as many other 4K models, the image is clearer and sharper thanks to the glass element lens. Contrast and black levels are also tops in this price range and not far off high-end projectors from JVC and Sony that cost twice as much. Once again, that’s due to the optics along with Anker’s 6-blade dynamic iris — another feature usually only found on high-end projectors — and the company’s “NebulaMaster 2.0” picture quality algorithm.\nColor accuracy is outstanding out of the box in both HDR and non-HDR modes thanks to the ISF (Image Science Foundation) certification normally reserved for more expensive projectors. In fact, I found the color calibration nearly perfect on my unit in “ISF Night” mode. That meant images were close to how they were calibrated by the filmmakers for TV series and movies like Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, Andor, Dune 2 and Spider-Man: No Way Home. If the colors aren’t quite to your liking, you can make fine adjustments manually. Like many other 4K projectors of this type, the X1 has a slight amount of light spill around the edge of the image. However, it’s well-controlled and only noticeable when the projected image is particularly dark.\nSound\n\n\n\n\n  Steve Dent for Engadget\n \n\nAnker put some extra work into the sound as well. Audio quality is solid thanks to the four built-in speakers with 40 watts total output. The lack of fan noise is a big help here. By itself, the X1 offers decent high-end and bass, but more importantly, dialog is easy to hear and understand.\nFor a big sonic upgrade, you can add a pair of Anker’s optional Nebula-branded satellite speakers that connect to the projector automatically via Wi-Fi. Each one has a pair of 40-watt front drivers, a 20-watt upward-firing driver and a 20-watt side-firing driver that combine to create a surround effect. Together with the projector, they deliver an impressive 200 watts of sound with Dolby Audio support (though not Dolby Atmos unfortunately). They’re also battery-powered with up to eight hours of use, which is especially handy for outdoor viewing. However, that also means you need to keep them charged.\nTo test these speakers, I selected several music-oriented movies including A Complete Unknown, Maestro and Rocketman, along with an action movie that has an impressive score and sound effects, Dune 2. In spite of their small size, the satellite speakers kept elements like music, dialog and sound effects crisp, clear and evenly balanced with powerful dynamic bass. You could certainly do better with a dedicated 5.1 or 7.1 surround sound system, but these speakers offer very respectable audio quality, are easy to set up and automatically sync with the picture. The X1 also supports other external Bluetooth speakers, but you may have to adjust the timing in the menus to ensure perfect sync for picture and sound.\nAnker also offers a $4,000 package that includes a pair of its Soundcore microphones along with the speakers. Those also connect to the X1 automatically and let you use it as a very expensive karaoke machine. They provide clear sound but you don’t get the usual benefits of a karaoke setup like AI vocal removal and vocal enhancement.\nWrap-up\n\n\n\n  The Nebula X1 offers a pair of HDMI 2.1 ports along with USB-C, USB-A and S/PIDF\n \n\n  Steve Dent for Engadget\n \n\nThe Nebula X1 is an odd proposition. It’s marketed as a portable outdoor projector, but it also happens to be the best indoor projector I’ve ever tested. With an impeccably sharp, high-contrast and color-accurate image, the video quality is irreproachable. The ease of setup and overall size also makes it an outstanding choice if you want to move the X1 around. With the optional satellite speakers, it’s the best portable projector you can get, hands down.\nThe Nebula X1 doesn’t have a lot of competition in the portable category, apart from Valerion’s $3,000 VisionMaster Pro 2, which also has a 4K triple laser engine. However, the X1 beats that model on image quality, portability and ease of setup.\nThe thing is, most people looking for a portable projector won’t spend more than $500, let alone $3,000. So who is this for? I think it’s ideal for buyers looking at a UST or high-end long-throw projector who want a bit more versatility. Some may even use it as a standalone indoor projector as it can be mounted on the ceiling or on a stand. In other words, if you have the means, use it any way you want — it’s that versatile.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/anker-nebula-x1-projector-review-the-king-of-outdoor-movies-if-you-can-afford-it-161519956.html?src=rss",

The capability is powered by Google's Veo 2 engine, and users will be able to select either \"Subtle movements\" or \"I'm feeling lucky\" as the prompt for their video. Google Photos is also getting a Remix feature that recreates images in other artistic styles, such as anime, comics, sketches, or 3D animation. Remix will begin rolling out in the coming weeks for US users on both Android and iOS. These tools will eventually be housed in a new Create tab that's due to start rolling out within the Google Photos platform in the US in August.\nYouTube Shorts will also add a photo-to-video capability.

The company noted that, like with Google Photos, the tool is powered by Veo 2, although Veo 3 support is slated to arrive in YouTube Shorts later this summer.

It also gives Google a large base to learn from as people try out the new features. The company noted these features are experimental, so it will ask users to leave a thumbs-up or thumbs-down on the AI-generated images and videos to provide feedback. That feedback will help Google to improve the product and overall experience, it says. Now that ability is being commoditized with the use of AI. Once you’ve selected a photo, you can choose from one of two prompts — “Subtle movements,” or “I’m feeling lucky” — to turn the photo into a six-second video clip. Both features will include an invisible SynthID digital watermark on their outputs to identify them as being AI-generated. The AI features were introduced alongside similar tools for YouTube Shorts, which is also now offering its own photo-to-video option as well as new AI effects, powered by Veo 2.

The move is designed to create a more open, competitive environment for the app economy and user choice. However, Apple and Google have pushed back at the proposals, with Apple saying changes would compromise user security and privacy. A final decision on the matter will arrive in October, after the two companies present their cases. If the proposal goes through, it would give the CMA the ability to address issues like the commission rates on in-app purchases, the app review process, app rankings, restrictions on developer access to certain technology, and default settings that could reduce competition, among other things. Tim Sweeney, CEO of Epic Games, which has been involved in antitrust lawsuits against the tech giants, expressed his disappointment in the proposed roadmap, as it doesn’t allow for competing mobile app stores like the Epic Games Store."

The intercepted messages “revealed numerous illicit activities related to cybercrime and ransomware,” and allowed investigators to identify at least $7 million in proceeds from cybercrime. The closed-access forum had more than 50,000 registered users and was a key marketplace for selling stolen data and hacking tools.

Lumo can search the web to answer questions beyond its knowledge cut-off date, but by default that feature is turned off to further protect user privacy. You can also upload files to Lumo. Here again Proton says the chatbot won't save any information.\nProton isn't touting the performance of Lumo's large language models, but if you're curious about this sort of thing, it's powered by a handful of open-source systems, including Mistral NeMo and Mistral Small 3, among others. Proton told The Verge Lumo will filter requests through the model best suited for the task. For example, it will use NVIDIA's OpenHands system for coding requests.\nLumo is free to use, with a weekly query limit. You don't need a Proton account to begin a conversation with the chatbot.

    "summary": "Apple has introduced a new tier of its AppleCare insurance policy called AppleCare One. This allows you to cover up to three of your Apple products under a single plan for $20 per month. If you want to add extra devices beyond that, you can do so for an additional $6 per month, per product.\nApple first introduced AppleCare+ in 2011 as a means of insuring your iPhone against accidental damage, and has since expanded the plan to its entire product line, adding coverage for theft and loss. Currently, AppleCare+ costs from $10 per month to insure an individual iPhone, with subscription prices starting at $3.49 per month for a Mac, and $5 for an iPad, depending on the model you own. You can also insure your Apple Watch, Vision Pro headset, AirPods, Apple TV and HomePod either individually, or as part of your new AppleCare One plan.\nAppleCare One features all the same benefits as AppleCare+, including unlimited repairs for accidents such as drops and spills, round-the-clock support from Apple experts, servicing and battery coverage. The theft and loss protection that was previously exclusive to iPhone plans now also covers iPad and Apple Watch if they’re included in your AppleCare One plan. You can make up to three claims a year for theft or loss of an iPhone, iPad or Apple Watch.\nThe $20 monthly price is fixed regardless of which products you include (as is the $6 you pay to add an additional device), meaning the amount you actually save will depend on what they would cost to insure individually, so it’s worth looking into that before you take out the new plan. Apple says that people who cover their iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch could save as much as $11 per month on AppleCare One compared to what they’d pay if each device was insured under AppleCare+.\nAlso new with AppleCare One is the ability to add devices you already own to a protection plan. Previously you’d have to decide within 60 days of purchasing an Apple device. Apple says that providing they’re under four years old, are in good condition when added and are in your Apple account, they can be covered under AppleCare One. You may need to run a diagnostic check either on the device itself or at an Apple Store to get it approved.\nAppleCare One also simplifies the trade-in process. If you trade in a product covered by your plan directly to Apple, it is automatically taken out and replaced by the new device. Unlike AppleCare+, though, there doesn’t appear to be a way to pay annually for your plan. Instead, it rolls monthly for as long as you need it, and Apple will let you move products in and out of coverage whenever you want.\nAppleCare One launches tomorrow in the US, and can be activated either on your iPhone, Mac or iPad, or in an Apple Store.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/applecare-one-lets-you-protect-three-devices-under-one-subscription-135559271.html?src=rss",

Apple first introduced AppleCare+ in 2011 as a means of insuring your iPhone against accidental damage, and has since expanded the plan to its entire product line, adding coverage for theft and loss. The theft and loss protection that was previously exclusive to iPhone plans now also covers iPad and Apple Watch if they’re included in your AppleCare One plan. The $20 monthly price is fixed regardless of which products you include (as is the $6 you pay to add an additional device), meaning the amount you actually save will depend on what they would cost to insure individually, so it’s worth looking into that before you take out the new plan. Apple says that people who cover their iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch could save as much as $11 per month on AppleCare One compared to what they’d pay if each device was insured under AppleCare+. Previously you’d have to decide within 60 days of purchasing an Apple device. Apple says that providing they’re under four years old, are in good condition when added and are in your Apple account, they can be covered under AppleCare One. You may need to run a diagnostic check either on the device itself or at an Apple Store to get it approved. If you trade in a product covered by your plan directly to Apple, it is automatically taken out and replaced by the new device. If you buy something through a link in this article, we may earn commission."

    "full_text": "The Switch 2 Pro controller is the best controller Nintendo has ever made – and that’s saying something. It’s incredibly comfortable to hold, its joysticks are buttery smooth, and all of its buttons are wonderfully responsive. Nintendo even made it customizable this time with rear buttons that can easily be mapped inside of any game. The Switch 2 Pro Controller costs $85, which seems a bit egregious when you can get an excellent controller like 8BitDo’s Ultimate 2 wireless gamepad for $60. As good as the competition is, though, you won’t find anything that can be easily configured directly from within the Switch 2’s user interface. My hands often feel cramped when I play that game with the Switch 2’s Joy-Con 2 controllers for too long. But there’s none of that with the Switch 2 Pro controller. I was able to race for an hour without any discomfort, and I also noticed that it was easier for me to pull off the game’s tricky jump maneuvers and rail sliding. The Switch 2 Pro controller is also seriously helpful with fighting games, thanks to its smooth and accurate directional pad. It acquits itself to most genres easily, though it would have been nice to see analog triggers for more precise control in serious racing games."

    "summary": "Meta is adding some of its teen safety features to Instagram accounts featuring children, even if they're ran by adults. While children under 13 years of age aren't allowed to sign up on the social media app, Meta allows adults like parents and managers to run accounts for children and post videos and photos of them. The company says that these accounts are \"overwhelmingly used in benign ways,\" but they're also targeted by predators who leave sexual comments and ask for sexual images in DMs. \nIn the coming months, the company is giving these adult-ran kid accounts its strictest message settings to prevent unsavory DMs. It will also automatically turn on Hidden Words for them so that account owners can filter out unwanted comments on their posts. In addition, Meta will avoid recommending them to accounts blocked by teen users to lessen the chances predators finding them. The company will also make it harder for suspicious users to find them through search and will hide comments from potentially suspicious adults on their posts. Meta says will continue \"to take aggressive action\" on accounts breaking its rules: It has already removed 135,000 Instagram accounts for leaving sexual comments on and requesting sexual images from adult-managed accounts featuring children earlier this year. It also deleted an additional, 500,000 Facebook and Instagram accounts linked to those original ones.\nMeta introduced teen accounts on Instagram last year to automatically opt users 13 to 18 years of age into stricter privacy features. The company then launched teen accounts on Facebook and Messenger in April and is even testing AI age-detection tech to determine whether a supposed adult user has lied about their birthday so they could be moved to a teen account if needed. \nSince then, Meta has rolled out more and more safety features meant for younger teens. It released Location Notice in June to let younger teens know that they're chatting with someone from another country, since sextortion scammers typically lie about their location. (To note, authorities have observed a huge increase in \"sextortion\" cases involving kids being threatened online to send explicit images.) Meta also introduced a nudity protection feature, which blurs images in DM detected as containing nudity, since sextortion scammers may send nude pictures first in an effort to convince a victim to send reciprocate. \nToday, Meta is also launching new ways for teens to view safety tips. When they chat with someone in DMs, they can now tap on the \"Safety Tips\" icon at the top of the conversation to bring up a screen where they can restrict, block or report the other user. Meta has also launched a combined block and report option in DMs, so that users can take both actions together in one tap. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/meta-is-adding-new-safety-features-to-kid-focused-ig-accounts-run-by-adults-110000524.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Whether you're backing up important files, editing videos on the go or just freeing up space on your laptop, a fast and reliable SSD drive can make your workflow a whole lot smoother. The best portable SSD options in 2025 combine speed, durability and wide compatibility, often using USB Type-C connections for quick transfers across devices. Unlike a traditional thumb drive or even the best external hard drives, these compact powerhouses can offer faster read speeds, often hitting several hundred or even thousands of Mbps, especially with high-performance NVMe SSD models.Whether you're managing large files or launching apps directly from your drive, we've rounded up the best SSDs that deliver excellent performance without weighing you down.\nTable of contents\n\nBest external SSDs for 2025\nOther external SSDs we tested\nWhat to consider before buying an external SSD\nHow we test external SSDs\nRecent updates\n\nBest external SSDs for 2025\n \n \n \nOther external SSDs we tested\nThe pre-built OWC Express 1M2 is a premium-feeling USB4 SSD that’s roughly as fast as the ADATA SE920, but it’s larger and significantly more expensive as of this writing. \nIf you’re in the relatively small group with a PC that supports USB 3.2 Gen 2x2 but not Thunderbolt or USB4, the Crucial X10 Pro is essentially a faster version of our top pick. The Lexar SL600 is a larger but slightly quicker option, while the Lexar SL500, Kingston XS2000 or Samsung T9 could also work if you see them on discount. As a reminder, though, drives like these are aimed primarily at content creators and other professionals, and you have to make sure you won’t upgrade to a device with a faster USB interface anytime soon.\nThe Samsung T7 Shield has a conveniently rugged design with a rubberized, IP65-rated shell. It also comes with both USB-C and USB-A cables. But it was consistently slower than the X9 Pro and XS1000 in our benchmark tests, plus it has a shorter three-year warranty.\nThe Silicon Power PX10 is an especially affordable USB 3.2 Gen 2 model. Its peak speeds weren’t too far off the X9 Pro or XS1000 in synthetic benchmarks, but it can get distractingly hot and its sustained writes are markedly worse. It took 50 seconds longer to move our 70GB custom test folder to this drive compared to the X9 Pro, for example.\nThe Crucial X6 is another low-cost option that’s a good bit slower than our top picks. It’s limited to a three-year warranty and lacks an IP rating as well. It’s not a terrible option for the basics, but there’s little reason to get it over the XS1000 when their prices are similar.\nThe OWC Envoy Pro FX is well-built and supports Thunderbolt 3 and USB 3.2 Gen 2, but it’s a smidge slower than the SE920 and Express 1M2, and it’s much pricier than the former.\n\n\n\n   The Samsung T9 portable SSD. \n \n\n   Samsung \n \n\nWhat to consider before buying an external SSD\nCapacity\nThe first thing to figure out before buying a portable SSD is just how much storage space you need. Most of the SSD drives we considered for this guide are available in capacities ranging from one to four terabytes, though plenty of smaller and larger options exist.\nThere’s no hard-and-fast rule for which size is “best” — that’ll ultimately depend on your budget and what exactly you’re looking to stash. But in general, it’s better to overcompensate than underdo it. Nobody wants to be forced into buying a second drive because they filled the first one up too quickly. If you’re backing up a PC, a good rule of thumb is to buy an external SSD with twice as much space as your computer’s internal storage. This way, you can save at least one full backup while also having room for additional data. If you want to store a bunch of PlayStation or Xbox games with huge install sizes, you may need more space. If you just want to back up a small collection of files, you may be better off saving your cash and just getting a smaller USB flash drive or thumb drive instead, which aren’t quite the same as the best portable SSDs we tested for this guide.\nPrice\nIn general, you get a better price-per-gigabyte ratio the further you go up the capacity ladder. As of this writing, the 1TB Samsung T9 is priced at $130, or $0.13 per gigabyte (GB), while the 4TB version is available for $297 or $0.07 per GB. That technically makes the larger model a better “value,” but not everyone needs to pay that much more upfront.\nSSDs in the same speed class tend to not vary too wildly in terms of performance, so part of our decision-making for this guide came down to which ones are often the cheapest. But prices can fluctuate over time; if you see that one of our top picks is priced way higher than a comparable honorable mention, feel free to get the latter. At this point in time, costs are broadly trending upwards for even the best SSDs.\n\n\n\n   The ADATA SE920 portable SSD connected to an Apple MacBook Pro. \n \n\n   Photo by Jeff Dunn / Engadget \n \n\nSpeed and USB interface\nJust about all external SSDs are significantly faster than mechanical hard disk drives (HDDs), so you’ll save time waiting for files to transfer and games to load no matter what. Within the market, however, there are distinct performance tiers. These are defined in large part by the USB interface a drive supports. While all of the SSDs we considered for this guide can connect over USB Type-C, some USB-C connections can supply faster transfer speeds than others. Sorting through this can get real confusing real fast, so we’ll try to put it in simple terms.\nYou can essentially divide today’s crop of portable SSDs into different segments. At the very top are drives that utilize the (relatively) new Thunderbolt 5 standard, which has a theoretical maximum transfer rate of 80 gigabits per second (Gbps). (You may see it advertise speeds up to 120 Gbps, but that boost doesn’t apply to storage devices.) But portable SSDs that support this tech only just started to trickle out toward the end of 2024, and the market for devices with Thunderbolt 5 ports is still fairly limited, with the most notable exceptions being Apple’s top-end Macs with an M4 Pro or M4 Max chip.\nThunderbolt 5 is built on a spec called USB4, which can technically reach up to 80 Gbps as well but is more typically available in a flavor that tops out at 40 Gbps. Portable SSDs based on that standard started to roll out toward the end of 2023 but are still relatively infrequent. The older Thunderbolt 3 and Thunderbolt 4, which other high-end external SSDs continue to use, support the same 40 Gbps maximum.\nA third version of USB4, meanwhile, maxes at 20 Gbps, as does an older yet more frequently used standard called USB 3.2 Gen 2x2. Below that is USB 3.2 Gen 2, which maxes at 10 Gbps. Then there’s USB 3.2 Gen 1, which is capped at 5 Gbps. Lastly, we’ll bundle together SSDs that use older standards and aren’t worth considering here.\nTo make this easy: For everyday folks, a good USB 3.2 Gen 2 drive is the sweet spot between fast-enough performance, wide-enough compatibility and cheap-enough price, so those make up our primary recommendations above. If you work in a creative field or don’t mind paying extra to shave seconds off your large file transfers, though, a “higher-tier” model would make sense. However, note that actual computers that utilize USB 3.2 Gen 2x2 aren’t super common — no Mac supports it, for one — and the interface is effectively being replaced by USB4.\nIn general, your chain is only as strong as its weakest link: If your computer only has USB 3.2 Gen 2 ports, for example, you could still use a Thunderbolt SSD, but you won’t get beyond Gen 2 speeds. Make sure you know what you’re working with before you buy.\nAs a refresher, storage devices are broadly measured in terms of read speeds and write speeds. The former refers to how long it takes to access something from the drive; the latter, how long it takes to save something to it. From there, you can break these metrics into sequential and random performance. Sequential speeds tend to matter more with portable SSDs, since most people use them to save or access long, constant streams of data such as a bunch of high-res photos. Random speeds would be important if you want to run video games or apps off the drive, since that’d involve reading and writing smaller, more scattered files. Either way, how well an SSD can sustain its performance with extended use is also critical.\nOther performance factors and enclosures\nA modern portable SSD’s speeds aren’t just about its USB interface, though. Its performance can also depend on how advanced its controller is, whether it has a native USB flash controller or a separate bridge chip to communicate with a host device, the kind and quality of NAND flash memory it uses, whether it has a DRAM cache or it’s DRAM-less, and more.\nWe’re simplifying things, but here are some quick tips: Drives with triple-level cell (TLC) memory aren’t as cheap as quad-level cell (QLC) SSDs, but they’re generally more reliable and they offer better write performance. Having a dedicated DRAM cache helps if you plan to hit your drive with more intense, sustained workloads, but may not be worth the extra cost for most people. Some models with native flash controllers may not perform as well as those with a bridging chip, depending on the SSD inside, but they typically draw less heat and are physically smaller. All of this is to say that an external SSD’s speeds aren’t quite as straightforward as what the manufacturer chooses to advertise on the box.\nIt’s also worth remembering that you can turn an internal SSD into a portable solution with a good enclosure. If you have a spare drive and don’t mind going the DIY route, this can be a cheaper and more flexible solution, though we’ve stuck to pre-built models for this guide for the sake of simplicity.\n\n\n\n\n   Photo by Jeff Dunn / Engadget \n \n\nSize, durability, endurance and warranty\nMost portable SSDs are impressively small and light, so they won’t be difficult to tuck in a bag (or even a pocket) and take on the go. We note above if any drive is bulkier than usual.\nNothing we’re talking about matters if your drive can’t last in the long term. It’s hard to definitively say which external SSDs are the most reliable, but we scoured through user reviews and feedback while researching this guide to ensure none of our picks show a pattern of catastrophic errors. If there was too much smoke around a particular model, we steered clear. We ruled out certain drives from SanDisk and Western Digital, for instance, after reports from Ars Technica and The Verge noted an issue that led to data loss (and lawsuits) in 2023.\nThat said, one of the big reasons you’d buy an SSD in general is its superior durability. Because it has no moving mechanical parts inside, an SSD has far fewer avenues to failure than an external hard drive. You still don’t want to be careless with them, but an accidental drop shouldn’t be the end of the world.\nSome portable SSDs build on this inherent ruggedness with plastic or rubberized casings and more robust waterproofing. These aren’t necessary for everyone, but if you’re a frequent traveler or someone who often works outdoors, there are options for you.\nStill, all drives can fail. If you have any sort of data you’d be distraught to lose, you should back it up regularly, then make a second backup, ideally with a cloud service. Along those protective lines, we also took note of the warranty policy for each drive we tested. Just about all of them are backed for either three or five years; of course, longer is better.\nEncryption and software\nIt’s not uncommon to store sensitive data on a portable SSD, so some models offer extra security features like hardware-based encryption — i.e., direct scrambling of data stored on the drive itself — built-in keypads and fingerprint readers to protect against unauthorized access if the drive is lost or stolen. While not top requirements, perks like these are certainly good to have. Some SSDs also come with companion software to further manage the drive. The best of those can be handy to have around, but we wouldn’t call them essential.\nHow we test external SSDs\nUnfortunately, we did not have access to a device that can make full use of USB 3.2 Gen 2, USB 3.2 Gen 2x2 and Thunderbolt/USB4 speeds interchangeably, so we had to split our testing across multiple devices, including an M1 Pro MacBook Pro and an Alienware gaming PC running Windows 11. Because of this, we primarily compared the portable SSDs within each “class” against one another. Before switching OSes, we reformatted each drive to each platform’s standard file system format: APFS for macOS and NTFS for Windows.\nAfter researching which SSDs had enough positive feedback to be worth testing in the first place, we put 13 drives through a range of synthetic and “real-world” benchmark tests. On Windows, these included CrystalDiskMark, PCMark 10’s Data Drive Benchmark and 3DMark’s gaming-focused Storage Benchmark. On macOS, we used AmorphousDiskMark (effectively a Mac version of CrystalDiskMark), BlackMagic Disk Speed Test and ATTO Disk Benchmark.\nWe also timed how long it took for each drive to read and write a custom 70GB folder filled with roughly 11,500 different files, including photos, videos, music files, PDFs and other large and small data types scattered across numerous subfolders. We performed multiple passes for each test to avoid irregularities, and we kept track of each SSD’s heat levels over the course of the whole suite. Our process wasn't a perfect science, but it gave us a general sense of how each drive compares to other models in its price and performance range.\nRecent updates\nFebruary 2025: We’ve checked to ensure the pricing info and links in this guide are still accurate. We’ve also added details on the (relatively) new Thunderbolt 5 interface, which has been implemented in a couple recent portable SSDs like the OWC Envoy Ultra and LaCie Rugged SSD Pro5. We’ll look to include testing notes for those for our next update, as they should be faster than the ADATA SE920, our current premium pick, albeit for a much higher price. For now, though, our top picks remain the same.\nOctober 2024: We’ve taken a sweep through this guide to ensure all pricing and availability info is still correct. Our recommendations are unchanged.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-portable-ssd-120043652.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Welcome to Video Games Weekly on Engadget. Expect a new story every Monday or Tuesday, broken into two parts. The first is a space for short essays and ramblings about video game trends and related topics from me, Jess Conditt, a reporter who's covered the industry for more than 13 years. The second contains the video game stories from the past week that you need to know about, including some headlines from outside of Engadget.\nPlease enjoy — and I'll see you next week.\n\nThis week, I’m fried. Maybe it’s the plodding and ever-present crumbling of society and human decency, or maybe it’s because Love Island USA just ended so I’m feeling extra listless. It’s a familiar summer sensation, but this year everything is exaggerated and extra tense, the stakes of every action seem higher, and instead of melting into the warmth of the season with a popsicle and a smile, I often find myself frozen and numb. I am the popsicle, coo coo ca choo.\nI’m not sure exactly what I’m trying to convey here, but I think it’s clear that I shouldn’t be writing anything too serious at the moment. I’m working on a few reports and trying to keep my composure amid the chaos, and all the while, the video game headlines keep rolling on. I’ve included a few more than usual this week, as penance for my popsicle state.\n\nThe news\nThe Chinese Room escapes from Tencent\nUK studio The Chinese Room, creator of Still Wakes the Deep and Everybody’s Gone to the Rapture, is independent once again. The Chinese Room leaders completed a management buyout with help from VC firm Hiro Capital to fully split the studio from Tencent subsidiary Sumo Digital, which acquired it in 2018. A number of people were laid off as part of the transition and the studio is left with a total of 55 employees. The Chinese Room is still working on Vampire: The Masquerade — Bloodlines 2 for Paradox Interactive, and it also has original projects in development.\nStill Wakes the Deep was one of my absolute favorite games of 2024. Whether you’re a fan of beautiful paranormal horror or you're just really into oil rigs, give it a go.\nRead these stories that Vice censored\nVice’s owner, Savage Ventures, doesn’t want you to read this story. Or this one.\nVice removed two articles about Steam’s new ban on certain “adult-only” content and the organization that pushed for the change, Collective Shout, which has the support of prominent anti-pornography groups with conservative religious foundations. The stories were written by contributor Ana Valens, who said the removals were “due to concerns about the controversial subject matter — not journalistic complaints.” Valens has vowed to never write for Vice again and a handful of reporters there have resigned in solidarity.\nCensoring stories about censorship is certainly a choice, Vice.\nSupermassive delays Directive 8020 and shrinks its team\nThe home of Until Dawn and The Dark Pictures Anthology, Supermassive Games, is laying off 36 people, restructuring its team and delaying one of its projects into 2026. A statement from the studio says the decisions were in response to the video game industry’s “challenging and ever-evolving environment.” It’s estimated that Supermassive had more than 300 employees before the layoffs.\nDirective 8020, the fifth installment in the Dark Pictures Anthology, is now due to come out in the first half of 2026, rather than this fall. Honestly, I’m not surprised to hear Supermassive needs more time to work on Directive 8020. I watched Engadget UK bureau chief Mat Smith play the demo at Summer Game Fest in June, and while it looked great, we were both surprised by how short and non-interactive the segment was. He summed up this feeling in his preview with the line, “Finally, I got to play (but only for a few minutes).”\nSupermassive is also working on Little Nightmares III, a series that it took over from Tarsier Studios. Tarsier created Little Nightmares and its sequel, but lost the rights to the IP when the team was acquired by a subsidiary of Embracer Group in 2019. Series publisher Bandai Namco kept the Little Nightmares brand and commissioned Supermassive to build the third game, while Tarsier is working on its own project, Reanimal.\nIt makes sense that Supermassive would prioritize Little Nightmares III in order to fulfill its obligations with Bandai. The game has already been delayed once, and it’s set to hit PC and consoles on October 10.\nFBC: Firebreak is getting less busted\nI still have high hopes for FBC: Firebreak to be the Left 4 Dead revival we’ve always wanted, but fact is, it’s not quite there yet. Remedy Entertainment is aware of this hard truth and has a plan to fix it. The studio laid out its pipeline for making FBC: Firebreak easier to jump into, more fun to play and less confusing overall, with most major changes coming in an update this winter.\nValve is still the best retirement community in game development\nPCGamesN published an interview with Counter-Strike co-creator Minh Le, who left Valve years ago to try out independent development. One sentiment stuck out to me.\n“They didn't force me out or anything,” Le told PCGamesN. “But a part of me kind of regrets it. Looking back, my decision to leave Valve was, financially, kind of a poor decision. If I had stayed with Valve, I would have been able to retire by now.”\nIt’s not presented as an indictment of Valve, but I find it notable that Le describes the studio as a place to retire, rather than a space to innovate and create the next generation of video games. At this rate, Valve will never outrun its reputation as the studio where talented game developers go to die (professionally speaking). \nBut, hey, at least they're not getting laid off en masse. Which, unfortunately, brings us to the next headline.\nYour favorite studio’s favorite studio faces layoffs\nCyberpunk 2077, Sea of Thieves and Dune: Awakening support studio Virtuos is laying off 270 developers, which is about seven percent of its staff. Virtuos is currently best known as the studio behind The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remastered alongside Bethesda, and it has more than 4,000 employees across Asia, Europe and North America. The cuts affect developers in Asia and Europe, with “fewer than 10” in France, where work on Oblivion Remastered was headquartered.\nHeck yeah, there’s gonna be a Hellraiser game\nMake sure to pin this one on your calendar. Saber Interactive is making Clive Barker's Hellraiser: Revival, a first-person, action-survival horror game that features actor Doug Bradley as Pinhead for the first time in nearly 20 years. Barker himself provided input on the story, too. It’s coming to PlayStation 5, PC and Xbox Series X/S, with no release date yet.\n\"The Hellraiser universe is defined by its unflinching exploration of pain, pleasure, and the thin and terrifying line that separates the two,\" a description from Saber Interactive reads. \"That essence is at the heart of our game.\"\n\nAn inside look at the fallout of the Zenimax layoffs\nGame Developer reporter Chris Kerr spoke with a number of employees at Zenimax who are still reeling from the layoffs that Microsoft enacted in early July. The vibes there sound pretty terrible.\n“This carcass of workers that remains is somehow supposed to keep shipping award-winning games,\" one senior QA tester told Kerr. The developer continued, “Microsoft just took everything that could have been great about the culture and collaboration and decimated it. Morale is terrible. It's grotesque. People are stressed. They're crying.”\nXbox cloud play anywhere\nWhen Xbox isn’t firing thousands of employees in one blow, it’s quietly laying the groundwork for the future of video game distribution. An update for Xbox Insiders this week introduces cross-platform cloud support, bringing your cloud library and play history to the Xbox PC app. This means you can access cloud activity on an Xbox console, PC or Windows handheld, and seamlessly play cloud games across devices. This is just how video games are going to work in the coming decades, and it’s interesting to watch our future slowly roll out in blog posts and software updates.\nSubnautica 2 scandal catch-up\nDid you miss all of the mess around Subnautica 2 last week? Or, more accurately, this past month? To quickly summarize, Subnautica publisher Krafton is being sued by the series creators after it fired them and then delayed their game, allegedly sabotaging a $250 million bonus payout due to developers. To not-quickly summarize, see my complete breakdown of the drama.\nMy Melody & Kuromi hits Netflix this week\nI don’t know who else needs a little levity in their life right now, but I certainly do. Thankfully, the stop-motion show My Melody & Kuromi is coming to Netflix on July 24, and there’s already an adorable tie-in music video by LE SSERAFIM to enjoy. Zen out, watch all of the Sanrio sweetness and finally settle the debate: Are you more of a Kuromi or a My Melody?\n\nAdditional reading\n\nKris Holt's weekly indie game roundup\n\n\nHave a tip for Jessica? You can reach her by email, Bluesky or send a message to @jesscon.96 to chat confidentially on Signal.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/video-games-weekly-censorship-shrinkage-and-a-subnautica-scandal-221839722.html?src=rss",

The proposed legislation would add schools, town councils, National Health Service (NHS) hospitals and critical infrastructure managers to a ban which already applies to the national government.\nThe logic behind banning payments is simple. If cybercriminals know a ransomware attack against a UK school or hospital won't get them paid, they'll look somewhere else for a more lucrative target. Security Minister Dan Jarvis said that the government is \"determined to smash the cyber criminal business model,\" and added that laws in the proposed package will require even private businesses to seek guidance from the government before paying a ransom.\nSince the WannaCry attack on the NHS in 2017 launched the modern era of ransomware attacks, the UK has suffered a number of serious incidents. In the last two years alone, attacks have hit the British Library, the BBC and the Ministry of Defence. This may explain why, according to the government's announcement, \"nearly three quarters\" of public comments on the ban legislation were supportive.\nAlthough bans on ransom payments are a popular solution to the ever-increasing scourge of ransomware, there's currently not much data on whether they work. Two US states, North Carolina and Florida, have enacted similar bans, but it's hard to say what impact they've had. Critics argue that some organizations, especially hospitals, can't afford the long-term disruption of leaving the ransom unpaid, and may choose to pay in unaccountable ways. Furthermore, some hacking groups have aims other than money, and may continue ransomware attacks to sow political chaos.\nThe UK is moving into uncharted territory as the first nation to pass a ransomware payment ban. We'll be interested to see whether it helps get attacks under control. Either way, the outcome is likely to inform how other countries respond to the continuing threat of cybercrime.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/new-uk-law-would-ban-ransomware-payments-by-publicly-funded-orgs-210851334.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Meta is no longer paying creators to post on Threads. The company quietly ended the Threads bonus program, which offered some creators thousands of dollars a month in bonuses, earlier this year, Engadget has confirmed.\nThe company hasn't officially commented on why it stopped the payments, but an Instagram support page that once listed details about the creator incentives no longer references Threads at all. In posts on Threads, creators who were once part of the program have said they stopped receiving payments around the end of April. That's roughly one year after Meta first started paying creators for popular posts. Though Meta never publicly shared a lot of details about how the program worked, creators who previously spoke with Engadget reported that they were able to earn monthly bonuses ranging from $500 to $5,000 in exchange for hitting specific metrics around post counts and views.\nIt's not clear what Meta's strategy for creators on Threads is going forward. The company is still trying to lure more brands and notable faces to the platform, and has tested features to help people find popular creators they previously followed on X. Meta has also added creator-friendly tools, like the ability to add more links to profiles and more detailed analytics for the app.\nBut Meta has yet to clearly explain what it can offer creators in return. The platform is hardly driving any traffic to outside websites. It's also much harder to build a following on Threads, since the platform defaults to an algorithmic timeline consisting mainly of recommended content. This means that it's easier for a post from an unknown account to go viral, but viral posts rarely lead to an influx of new followers.\nMeta may simply be calculating that Threads already has enough momentum without paying people for viral content. At the same time, Mark Zuckerberg has repeatedly said he believes the app can be Meta's next billion-user platform. It's difficult to see how that happens without the buy-in of creators.\nHave a tip for Karissa?

    "summary": "Gamers aren't usually known for their sartorial elegance. But that doesn't mean we don't deserve nice things. So after checking out a very utilitarian carrying case for the Switch 2, I wanted to explore the other side of things with a more lavish travel bag. And while Waterfield's Magnetic case for Nintendo's latest console certainly isn't the most rugged or affordable way to lug a handheld console around, it might just be the most luxurious.\nDesign: Drape me in this leather\nCompared to most Switch 2 travel bags that are made out of materials like plastic and polyester, Waterfield's case is an exercise in opulence. It's crafted from buttery full-grain leather that's softer than than a perfectly worn in baseball mitt or fancy Dior gloves. It really is that nice. \n \nI've been using the white leather model as I love how clean and simple it looks while still giving you that irresistible pillowy exterior. But for the kind of folk who get excited about patina, the chocolate model features a more distressed look that isn't afraid to show off oil, scuffs and blemishes. And if the need arises, you can always hit the case with hot air from a hair dryer to reduce the appearance of scratches.\nBut the thing that sets Waterfield's case apart from its competition is that instead of relying on a zipper, the pouch has a series of magnets to keep everything together. And honestly, there's just something really nice about not having any sharp objects near or around the case, so there's no fear of your Switch 2 getting nicked. This enclosure system also makes it super simple to thread a cable inside, allowing you to charge Nintendo's latest handheld without it needing to leave the safety of its case. On a practical level, I've also found that because taking the console in and out is so quick and easy, I'm much better about putting things back when I'm done gaming.\nThe obvious downside to this is that it's easier for stuff like sand to get inside and if you're storing tiny accessories like a microSD Express card, there's no real guarantee it won't fall out while you're in transit. Additionally, the trade-off for the case's fancy leather exterior is that it doesn't have the hard, rigid panels used in a lot of competitors, so it's not the most rugged travel companion. If you press down on the outside of the case, you can feel things like console's buttons and joysticks, so this definitely isn't something you'll want to cram into an already stuffed piece of luggage.\nOn the inside, Waterfield's case is lined with a plush microfiber fabric that will keep the Switch 2 nice and cozy. There are also two pockets for stashing small items like charging cables, game cartridges or Joy-Con straps. But I do mean small, because anything larger will cause the case to bulge, which may put undue stress on the console.\nOptional accessories\n\n\n\n\n   Sam Rutherford for Engadget \n \n\nThis case doesn't come with much in the way of bundled extras. Though like a lot of luxury products (just look at the options list on a Porsche or Ferrari), you can purchase additional accessories such as cord clips, AirTag holders and more. But the most important of these are Waterfield's game card holders, which are available in several sizes (4, 10 and 20). So I went and bought a 10-slot sleeve and it really is the perfect complement to the case. Cartridges fit snug and the holder itself nestles neatly into the pouch's built-in pockets. I just wish one came included, as you're looking at an extra $10 to $30 on top of an already pricey travel protector.\nWrap-up\nStarting at $90 for the nylon or waxed canvas models or $120 for the leather versions, Waterfield's Magnetic Case for the Switch 2 certainly ain't cheap. That's more expensive than Belkin's Charging Case, which comes with its own battery pack. And that's before you factor in a game card holder.\n\n\n\n\n   Sam Rutherford for Engadget \n \n\nBut the sheer suppleness of its leather and its super soft interior might be the comfiest cocoon Nintendo's handheld will ever experience. Then you add in a magnetic enclosure system and it feels like Waterfield has managed to transform a product that might normally be an afterthought into something that's a joy to use all by itself. So for those who want a travel pouch that looks and feels just as good as the console it's protecting (if not better), this case is in a class of its own.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/waterfield-magnetic-case-review-the-most-lavish-way-to-carry-your-switch-2-around-200052731.html?src=rss",

This goes live on July 31, allowing folks to juice up at more than 12,000 Supercharger stations throughout North America. Some of the company's vehicles can already use these charging stations, with the Gravity SUV gaining access earlier this year.\nThat leaves the Air line of luxury EV sedans. These vehicles will be able to roll up to a Tesla Supercharger for a top-off at the end of the month, but there are some major caveats. First of all, Lucid Air EVs will require an official adapter that costs $220, as they don't ship with a built-in NACS ports. This adapter won't work with V1 or V2 charging stations, which whittles down the convenience factor a bit.\nThere's another problem for Air owners. The adapter is limited to a 50kW peak charge rate, which provides around 200 miles of range per hour of charging. The Air can typically achieve a 300kW peak charge rate. Not only is this hobbled charge rate bad for Lucid Air devotees, it's also annoying for people that own other EVs. Remember, the Air will have to sit at the charger for an entire hour, which will increase traffic at the station.\nLuckily, there are other charging stations available that make use of that 300kW peak rate. Air owners can use stations by Electrify America, EVgo and ChargePoint for a quick jolt. It's good to know that the Tesla Superchargers will be there in a pinch, which could come in handy during a road trip.\n\n\nThe company also recently unveiled the 2026 lineup of Air EVs. There's the Lucid Air Pure, which is a relatively streamlined option. Prices for this one start at $70,900. The Lucid Air Touring boasts an estimated range of 431 miles per charge, which is a decent metric. It starts at $79,900. Finally, the Lucid Air Grand Touring is the baddest of the bunch, with an estimated range of 512 miles per charge.

The Game Capture 4K S works with just about any modern console, PC or handheld gaming device, including the Switch 2. Retailing for $160, this is the CORSAIR subsidiary’s best value yet for capturing in 4K. Elgato's higher-end 4K X supports 4K capture at 144 fps but costs quite a bit more.\nThough a more affordable model, the 4K S doesn't skimp where it matters. The new capture card features zero-latency passthrough to your main display, and Elgato says latency in software previews can be as low as 30 milliseconds. Short of the most competitive FPS games, this is fast enough to play on a single screen if you must. If you are trying to capture a game like Valorant or CS2 and care more about frame rate than raw resolution, the 4K S can record at 1440p120 or 1080p240.\nThe 4K S also supports HDR10 passthrough up to 4K60, HDR10 capture to 1080p60 on Windows, VRR support and it has an analog audio jack for native team chat. The device is plug-and-play over USB-C for Windows 11, macOS and iPadOS. For those whose creative workflow lives on iPad, the 4K S can capture directly to iPad models with a USB-C port. Thanks to UVC compliance, the device is compatible with OBS Studio, Streamlabs, Zoom, TikTok Live Studio and other major broadcast apps.\n\nElgato is also releasing its newest capture application, Elgato Studio, which will replace 4KCU in the coming months. The software auto-detects the 4K S and offers ultra-low latency on previews. It will also include features like a snapshot tool for social media clips and allow creators to try out beta features through the software.\nThe Game Capture 4K S is available now for $159.99.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/elgatos-new-game-capture-4k-s-is-switch-2-compatible-164745527.html?src=rss",

Billed by its maker as the ideal entry-level fitness watch, the $99 Watch 3 Pro is the most advanced CMF wearable to date, promising updated health tracking and various built-in AI coaching features.\nThe Watch 3 Pro introduces dual-band GPS, which should make its route tracking more accurate, as well as a new four-channel heart rate sensor that Nothing says offers \"improved accuracy across all skin tones and workout intensities.\" You can choose from 131 sports modes, which is 11 more than its predecessor, with a personalized AI coach providing post-workout summaries and guidance. This includes long-distance running endurance predictions to help you train for that looming 10K.\nIn addition to the updated heart rate and sleep tracking, the Watch 3 Pro is also capable of blood oxygen (SpO₂) monitoring, stress tracking, guided breathing exercises, hydration and inactivity reminders, as well as women’s health tracking.\nOn-wrist ChatGPT integration allows you to ask questions and set reminders using \"natural language\" voice prompts, and there’s a voice recorder with autotranscription for when you want to quickly log a mid-run thought. You can also use AI to generate custom watch faces using the Watch Face Studio, in which you’ll find more than 120 styles premade out of the box. Widgets can be applied for fitness, weather, music or reminders, with a full-screen option available.\nCMF’s latest wearable has a 1.43-inch AMOLED, always-on display, and you’re getting a 10 percent increase in screen-to-body ratio compared to the Watch Pro 2 before it. Battery life is 13 days with \"typical\" use, which Nothing says is a two-day improvement over its predecessor. If you're hitting the tracking hard you can expect around 11 days of juice on a full charge. With the always-on display enabled, battery life unsurprisingly takes a significant hit to around 4.5 days.\nNothing says the Watch 3 Pro and all other smartwatches in the CMF lineup now use the Nothing X app, with the new control centre promising improved stability and a more intuitive UI. It also plays nice with Strava, Apple Health, and Google Health Connect\nYou’re getting a fair bit of bang for your buck, then, but we’ll have to wait and see how the Watch 3 Pro fares against pricier alternatives where everyday performance is concerned. When TechRadar reviewed the Watch 2 Pro earlier this year, it had lots of positive impressions of the watch, but noted some spotty fitness tracking and sensor detection. 9to5Google was even more critical, finding fault with the heart rate tracking and concluding that the product felt unfinished. And while the Watch 3 Pro covers a lot of the bases for fitness watches with its various sensors, it still lacks NFC for payments, which could be a deal-breaker for some people.\nAvailable in Dark Grey, Light Grey, and Orange colorways, the CMF Watch 3 Pro costs $99 (a not insignificant $30 bump on the Watch Pro 2) is available to buy now.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wearables/nothings-99-cmf-watch-3-pro-offers-better-battery-life-and-ai-fitness-coaching-151058055.html?src=rss",

He also wrote and directed the first instalment, which premiered in 1987. \nClive Barker’s Hellraiser: Revival is a single-player game that has you play as Aidan while fighting your way through an \"action survival horror experience.\" You also must deal with Pinhead, who's known for harvesting human souls — yeah, this is a creepy game. As Saber Interactive states, \"The Hellraiser universe is defined by its unflinching exploration of pain, pleasure, and the thin and terrifying line that separates the two. That essence is at the heart of our game.\" You can see for yourself in the announcement trailer.\n\nThe team at Saber Interactive took an additional step to ensure fans of the movie franchise are happy.

If you're comfortable slipping an AirTag into an interior pocket of a bag or coat, you can do so without an extra accessory.

But if you’d rather hook the tracker to the outside, you’ll need something a bit larger and more flexible than a standard key ring. Belkin’s Secure Holder with Strap is a good option: it comes in different colors and it’s budget friendly at only $13. The case opens up into two pieces, allowing you to sit the AirTag inside the circle and twist and snap the two halves together to lock it in. You can then attach the AirTag to your luggage handle, dog collar, water bottle or other item with the strap, which feels quite strong. I appreciate the unique design of Belkin’s Secure Holder, although it was hard to twist open when the AirTag was inside of it. But that’s a good thing for daily use; your AirTag isn’t going anywhere when in the Secure Holder. I also liked its slightly raised edges, which provide extra protection against impacts and bumps."

    "summary": "Whether it’s your nephew who wants a new iPad, your sister who needs a new pair of AirPods or your parent who could benefit from an easy-to-use MacBook, Apple devices are some of the most in-demand devices you can get today. That means, unfortunately, that big discounts are few and far between, and they’re often the first to sell out when sales do arise. But make no mistake: you can find good Apple deals across the web, you just have to know where to look.\nEngadget keeps track of deals like these regularly, so we’re here to help. We’ve collected the best Apple deals on items like AirPods, MacBooks, iPads and more that you can get right now. Just note: you’ll find the best Apple deals from retailers like Amazon, Best Buy, Walmart, Target and others — not directly from Apple. Unless you shop refurbished, you’ll always pay top dollar direct at Apple, and for some things (like iPhones), that might be the best route to take.  \nBest Apple Watch deals\n \nApple Watch SE for $169 (32 percent off): We wouldn’t be surprised to see an update to Apple’s budget smartwatch sometime soon (and we have a few suggestions on the matter). But thanks to some serious discounts, the Apple Watch SE has turned out to be the most affordable way to get an iPhone companion for your wrist. Despite the lackluster screen and limited extra features, it handles the basics well. Also at Best Buy and Walmart.\nBest AirPods deals\n \nBest iPad deals\n \niPad Pro (M4, 11-inch) for $899 ($100 off): The most powerful iPad is the iPad Pro, and it’s the one to get if you’re even toying with the idea of using your new slab as a laptop replacement. Both the 11- and 13-inch models have gorgeous displays, thinner and lighter designs, a repositioned front camera and the excessively powerful M4 chip inside. Also at Best Buy. \nBest MacBook deals\n \nApple MacBook Air (15-inch, M3, 24GB RAM) for $1,299 ($400 off): The last-gen M3 MacBook Air has officially been discontinued, but it remains a superb laptop while the last bits of stock remain available. We gave this 15-inch model a score of 90 in our review — outside of its slower chip (which is still plenty fast for everyday use), marginally improved camera and inability to power two external displays with the lid open, it's virtually identical to the newer version. This deal applies to the model with the larger 24GB of memory in the Starlight colorway. \nMacBook Air (M3, 15-inch) for $949 ($350 off): The base model M3 MacBook Air is also available at a sizeable discount..\nApple MacBook Air (15-inch, M4) for $1,049 ($150 off): The 15-inch MacBook Air is nearly identical to the smaller version but features more robust speakers and a more spacious trackpad alongside its roomier display. Also at B&H.\nBest Apple accessories deals\nApple Pencil (USB-C) for $69 ($10 off): This more affordable Apple Pencil doesn’t support pressure sensitivity, but it still makes for a useful stylus for the basics. If you’re a casual note-taker and can live without wireless charging, you’ll save a few bucks by picking this one up. Also available at Walmart.\nApple Pencil (2nd gen) for $90 ($39 off): The Second gen Pencil both attaches and charges magnetically, supports tilt and pressure sensitivity and allows for tool changes with a tap of the flat edge. It’s an older pencil and isn’t compatible with the latest iPad models. This is the lowest price we’ve tracked this year, but it went as low as $80 for last year’s Black Friday sales.\nRead more Apple coverage:\n\nThe best AirPods\nThe best Apple Watches\nThe best MacBooks\nThe best iPhones\nThe best iPads\n\nFollow @EngadgetDeals on X for the latest tech deals and buying advice.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/best-apple-deals-150020110.html?src=rss",
    "full_text": "Whether it’s your nephew who wants a new iPad, your sister who needs a new pair of AirPods or your parent who could benefit from an easy-to-use MacBook, Apple devices are some of the most in-demand devices you can get today. Engadget keeps track of deals like these regularly, so we’re here to help. Apple Watch SE for $169 (32 percent off): We wouldn’t be surprised to see an update to Apple’s budget smartwatch sometime soon (and we have a few suggestions on the matter). Apple MacBook Air (15-inch, M3, 24GB RAM) for $1,299 ($400 off): The last-gen M3 MacBook Air has officially been discontinued, but it remains a superb laptop while the last bits of stock remain available. We gave this 15-inch model a score of 90 in our review — outside of its slower chip (which is still plenty fast for everyday use), marginally improved camera and inability to power two external displays with the lid open, it's virtually identical to the newer version. MacBook Air (M3, 15-inch) for $949 ($350 off): The base model M3 MacBook Air is also available at a sizeable discount.. Apple MacBook Air (15-inch, M4) for $1,049 ($150 off): The 15-inch MacBook Air is nearly identical to the smaller version but features more robust speakers and a more spacious trackpad alongside its roomier display. If you’re a casual note-taker and can live without wireless charging, you’ll save a few bucks by picking this one up. This is the lowest price we’ve tracked this year, but it went as low as $80 for last year’s Black Friday sales. Follow @EngadgetDeals on X for the latest tech deals and buying advice."
