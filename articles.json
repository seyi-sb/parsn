    "summary": "You might find it kind of sad to put a hard-earned gadget into a protective case. To me, it’s freeing. Using a case relieves me of the worry that it will accumulate tons of little scratches. So, I wasted no time testing cases on the new Nintendo Switch 2, and it didn’t take long for […]",
    "full_text": "I also tried slim cases that have one job: to protect the console when it isn’t in use. I just listed my high standards for form-fitting cases made to fit the Switch 2 while it’s in use. The tier I recommend for most Switch 2 players (especially those who will often throw their console into a bag) is the $79.85 “Travel” tier, which includes a semi-transparent travel cover that protects the front of your console during transit, or just for safekeeping when you aren’t using it. When this post originally went live, Dbrand was in the midst of updating its Killswitch so that it wouldn’t allow the Joy-Con 2s’ magnets to break away without pressing their release buttons. Belkin’s case can carry 12 cartridges, and it’s only slightly thicker than the PowerA case, likely to compensate for whatever cables or small gizmos you might stuff into its pocket. Neither of those may be deal-breakers for you, but are worth keeping in mind. JSAUX makes a relatively slim zip-up Switch 2 case that absolutely pops with color. Expressiveness is its main appeal, as this $25.99 case slouches on other features you might want. Underneath it is a fabric tray stitched into the case that can hold 12 game cartridges. If you don’t ever plan to connect your Switch 2 to its dock or detach its Joy-Cons, or it’ll be a rare occurrence, you might pick an all-in-one shell that fits completely around the console."

Kindle Paperwhite (2024) $ 125 $ 160 22 % off $ 125 Amazon’s latest Kindle Paperwhite — aka our favorite ebook reader — is perfect for the valentine who likes to relax by the pool or pretty much anywhere. It’s designed to last for weeks at a time, not days, while a larger seven-inch display and adjustable color temperature allow for more natural lighting in any environment. Amazon’s other discounted Kindles are also worth considering depending on your needs. If you read a lot of textbooks with visuals or enjoy graphic novels, I’d recommend buying the Kindle Colorsoft Signature Edition instead. It is largely similar to the Paperwhite but steps things up with a 150ppi color mode that’s impressively vibrant for an E ink screen. Then there’s the Kindle Scribe, which is designed for readers who like to take notes while reading. The Kindle Scribe even features AI-powered tools that can clean up your handwriting and keep everything organized, making it an excellent all-in-one study companion."

    "summary": "\nIf you're a devoted iPhone owner like me, you'll be excited to check out all the exciting new updates coming to Apple's operating system this fall: iOS 26. The coolest change, in my opinion, is the new Liquid Glass design (think Windows Vista, but arguably more thoughtful), which looks to be Apple's largest visual update in years. We spent two weeks test-driving it — you can check out our detailed hands-on iOS 26 preview, or you can try it out yourself by downloading and installing the public beta, available now. (While the beta is open to the public and stable, always remember there's a degree of risk involved with beta software.) Not ready to upgrade your smartphone this year? No worries, we'll help you find out if your phone will be able to run iOS 26.\nLast year, Apple didn't nix any iPhones from its eligibility list, but that's not the case for 2025 — a few models are getting cut this time. All iPhone 8 models and the iPhone X were the last to get the boot in 2023, and this year the 2018 models are getting left behind. If you have an ineligible device, you won't be able to download iOS 26 when it becomes available this fall.\nWe'll get to the bottom of which iPhones will support iOS 26 this year. To see what's coming with the latest OS and more, check out everything announced at Apple's WWDC June 9 event. One thing you shouldn't immediately expect is Apple's updated version of Siri, though the company is reportedly working on a 'stripped-down' AI chatbot to compete with ChatGPT.\nThese three iPhones won't be compatible with iOS 26\nUnlike last year, several iPhone models won't be eligible to download the newest iOS when it makes its debut this fall. This trio of models first released in 2018 won't be coming to the iOS 26 party:\n\niPhone XR\niPhone XS\niPhone XS Max\n\niPhones compatible with iOS 26\nWhile we don't yet know the new iPhones Apple will be dropping this fall — though there are iPhone 17 rumors — we do know, per Apple's site, that the phones listed below will be compatible with iOS 26. Basically, if you have an iPhone that was announced in 2019 or later, you're in the clear:\n\niPhone SE (second generation or later)\niPhone 11\niPhone 11 Pro\niPhone 11 Pro Max\niPhone 12\niPhone 12 mini\niPhone 12 Pro\niPhone 12 Pro Max\niPhone 13\niPhone 13 mini\niPhone 13 Pro\niPhone 13 Pro Max\niPhone 14\niPhone 14 Plus\niPhone 14 Pro\niPhone 14 Pro Max\niPhone 15\niPhone 15 Plus\niPhone 15 Pro\niPhone 15 Pro Max\niPhone 16e\niPhone 16\niPhone 16 Plus\niPhone 16 Pro\niPhone 16 Pro Max\n\nWhat if I don't want to buy a new iPhone?\nIf you want to continue using your older iPhone that isn't supported by iOS 26, that's fine. However, you'll miss out on security updates which could potentially put your phone at risk for malware and other threats. Additionally, some apps may stop working if they require a certain version of iOS or later. And of course, you won't be able to access the latest features iOS 26 offers.\nWhen will iOS 26 become available?\nApple usually rolls out its latest iOS in mid-September, just a few days before the new iPhones hit store shelves. Last year, it released iOS 18 on Monday, Sept. 16. Expect a confirmation of the release date at the iPhone 17 event, expected in early September. \niOS 26 features we're excited about\nLiquid Glass design: Your home screen is getting revamped with new app icons, including dark mode and all-clear options. You'll also notice buttons with a new floating design. Liquid Glass was designed to make all of Apple's OSes more cohesive.\nPhone app redesign: You'll finally be able to scroll through contacts, recent calls and voicemail messages all on one screen. It also comes with a new feature called Hold Assist that'll notify you when an agent comes to the phone so you can avoid the elevator music.\nLive Translate: iOS 26 is bringing the ability to have a conversation via phone call or text message with someone who speaks another language. Live Translate will translate your conversation in real time. \nPolls feature: Coming to group messages in the Messages app, chat members will be able to create polls. This can help prevent the unwanted 30+ messages when it comes to deciding which restaurant you're meeting at this weekend.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/heres-a-comprehensive-list-of-compatible-iphones-that-can-download-the-ios-26-beta-today-191854632.html?src=rss",

    "full_text": "The Z85’s OLED panel is its standout feature, as it achieves perfect black levels and vivid color. It has a 120Hz refresh rate panel, and two of its four HDMI ports support that speed at 4K. A panel with full array local dimming offers better control of brightness and contrast than direct- or edge-lit LED panels (this video from LG shows how it works, but lower your volume first), providing a more consistent picture across the entire screen. If you want a TV that produces reference-quality images, Sony’s Bravia 8 II (K65XR80M2) is the best choice. Any OLED TV can show true black, but judges agreed that the Bravia 8 II pulled ahead in grayscale and contrast when viewing SDR video. Its embedded A9 AI Processor Gen7 offers higher-quality video upscaling and image optimization compared to the C3. You’ll get great contrast and all of the important gaming features available on higher-end TVs while spending substantially less. Sony’s 65-inch A95L is a premium TV with features that should appeal to gamers and cinephiles alike. Sony’s Cognitive Processor XR powers the A95L, which enables better motion processing so sports and games look less blurry. The A95L is a Bravia-series TV, which means it can access Sony’s Picture Core."

As part of efforts to promote “healthy use” of ChatGPT, which now reaches nearly 700 million weekly users, OpenAI is also rolling out reminders to take a break if you’ve been chatting with the AI chatbot for a while. During “long sessions,” ChatGPT will display a notification that says, “You’ve been chatting a while — is this a good time for a break?” with options to “keep chatting” or end the conversation. OpenAI notes that it will continue tweaking “when and how” the reminders show up. The Google-owned Character.AI platform has also launched safety features that inform parents which bots their kids are talking to after lawsuits accused its chatbots of promoting self-harm. Another tweak, rolling out “soon,” will make ChatGPT less decisive in “high-stakes” situations. That means when asking ChatGPT a question like “Should I break up with my boyfriend?” the chatbot will help walk you through potential choices instead of giving you an answer."

(NYT editors, you missed an opportunity to include \"J is for jacks.\") \"V for vendetta\" can refer to the 2005 movie of the same name -- and it's probably why this category is phrased so awkwardly, because it's not \"V is for vendetta,\" so the always-grammatically correct NYT editors put the word \"is\" in parentheses, since it's not used here. The final one is probably meant to refer to \"A for effort,\" an expression meaning you get good marks for trying, though some people online are saying it should be \"E for effort,\" which doesn't make as much sense to me. But of course many countries don't say \"zee\" for Z, they say \"zed,\" so ziti could be confusing. And some people pronounce decay more like \"duh-kay,\" so that might also be tricky."

The company says that the ban \"reduces competition, decreases consumer choice and drives up consumer costs and inconvenience.\" Rivian believes Ohio's law is particularly unfair because it contains a carveout for the company's competitor Tesla.\nOhio currently requires the state DMV to not provide a dealership license to \"a manufacturer, or a parent company, subsidiary, or affiliated entity of a manufacturer, applying for a license to sell or lease new or used motor vehicles at retail.\" The law keeps car sales in the hands of independently owned car dealerships — except for Tesla. An exception was created for Tesla in 2014, The Columbus Dispatch writes, after the EV maker reached an agreement with the Ohio Dealership Association. Now cars in the state are sold through traditional car dealerships, and three dealerships owned and operated by Tesla.\n\"Rivian believes that consumers should be able to choose the vehicles they purchase,\" Rivian's Chief Administrative Officer Mike Callahan shared in a statement. \"Consumer choice is a bedrock principle of America's economy. Ohio's archaic prohibition against the direct-sales of vehicles is unconstitutional, irrational and harms Ohioans by reducing competition and choice and driving up costs and inconvenience.\"\nThe company's lawsuit does a good job of laying out the illogical situation Ohio has created with its ban. Rivian is allowed to perform repairs on cars in the state and deliver cars purchased out-of-state to Ohioans. \"Nonsensically, the thing that Rivian cannot do is actually complete the sale of Rivian vehicles in Ohio,\" the company writes. \"This imposes an extraordinary burden on Ohio consumers and Rivian for no legitimate reason.\"\nAs The Verge notes, bans on direct car sales have historically exist to prevent large, established car companies from having a monopoly on the sale of their own cars. Going direct to consumer is one of the ways EV makers have differentiated themselves from older brands, something companies like Tesla and Rivian can't do in states with bans. Rivian could try and strike a deal like Tesla, but filing a federal lawsuit suggests the company could be aiming to win a bigger, more lasting change. Rivian has achieved similar wins in the past.

    "summary": "Apple's large internal AI push is aimed at catching up with its competition.",
    "full_text": "Apple is internally working on a \"ChatGPT-like search experience\" to instantly generate answers for users, according to a report from Bloomberg on Sunday. The company is reportedly building an \"answer engine\" -- an AI-powered service that pulls from information online to answer general queries. It's also possible that a separate app might be developed. This AI search could power Siri, Spotlight and Safari. Instead of rushing to build AI models that could power the next generation of Siri, Apple opted to partner with OpenAI and leverage its technology. Reports surfaced earlier this year that Apple was looking to purchase Perplexity, an AI company that's taking on Google with an AI-powered search engine. Currently, Apple has a lucrative $20 billion per year deal with Google to allow it to be the default search engine on Apple devices. That's also why Apple hasn't built its own competing search engine -- although, Apple argues that even if the deal didn't exist, we can't assume it'd have made a competing search engine. That deal is now on shaky ground after the Department of Justice's antitrust division sued Google and won, declaring the company is maintaining an illegal monopoly in online search. As a judge weighs remedies in this case, Apple has been barred from participating in the case, meaning Apple could lose $12.5 billion in annual revenue if the DOJ forces how Google makes these deals."

Amazon CEO Andy Jassy reportedly said that Alexa Plus could open the door to \"significant financial opportunity\" by delivering ads during conversations. Read more: I'm Still Waiting for Amazon's Big Alexa AI Upgrade. If the plan moves forward, it would mark a big shift for Alexa, which until now has mostly steered clear of overt advertising. For now, it's unclear what exactly such advertising would look like, but the idea is that Alexa Plus could showcase ads for products users may be interested in buying and highlight deals. Alexa has struggled to make money for Amazon, and the company has been racing to give its voice assistant an AI upgrade that can compete with OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Gemini. The thinking is that adding ads could help Amazon recoup some of those AI costs, but it might make the user experience less compelling. The service costs $20 per month, but is free for Amazon Prime members. While there are no set plans for advertising in Alexa, it's worth keeping an eye on how Amazon plans to roll out these changes and whether you'll have the option to pay to skip the ads altogether."

    "full_text": "Previously, she was a writer and editor at MUO. The AI search startup Perplexity is allegedly skirting restrictions meant to stop its AI web crawlers from accessing certain websites, according to a report from Cloudflare. The report only adds to concerns about Perplexity vacuuming up content without permission, as the company got caught barging past paywalls and ignoring sites’ robots.txt files last year. Now, Cloudflare, one of the world’s biggest internet architecture providers, says it received complaints from customers who claimed that Perplexity’s bots still had access to their websites even after putting their preference in their websites’ robots.txt file and by creating Web Application Firewall (WAF) rules to restrict access to the startup’s AI bots. To test this, Cloudflare says it created new domains with similar restrictions against Perplexity’s AI scrapers. But if the website has restrictions against AI scraping, Cloudflare claims Perplexity will change its user agent — the bit of information that tells a website what kind of browser and device you’re using, or if the visitor is a bot — to “impersonate Google Chrome on macOS.” Cloudflare says this “undeclared crawler” uses “rotating” IP addresses that the company doesn’t include on the list of IP addresses used by its bots. Additionally, Cloudflare claims that Perplexity changes its autonomous system networks (ASN), a number used to identify groups of IP networks controlled by a single operator, to get around blocks as well. In a statement to The Verge, Perplexity spokesperson Jesse Dwyer called Cloudflare’s report a “publicity stunt,” adding that “there are a lot of misunderstandings in the blog post.” Cloudflare has since delisted Perplexity as a verified bot and has rolled out methods to block Perplexity’s “stealth crawling.” Cloudflare CEO Matthew Prince has been outspoken about AI’s “existential threat” to publishers. Last month, the company started letting websites ask AI companies to pay to crawl their content, and began blocking AI crawlers by default."

    "summary": "Despite securing big names in the business, the company is now shifting its strategy in an effort to better compete with rivals like Spotify and YouTube.",
    "full_text": "Amazon is denying that it’s shutting down Wondery, the podcast studio it acquired in late 2020, after Bloomberg reported on Monday that the company was closing the studio and cutting 110 jobs. Amazon told TechCrunch that Wondery will continue to develop creator-led podcasts under the Wondery brand within a new team. What’s changing is that the company is separating the teams that oversee Wondery’s narrative podcast efforts from those developing its creator-led shows. Wondery is combining its narrative podcast studio, which includes podcasts like Dr. Death and American Scandal, with Audible. “The podcast landscape has evolved significantly in the past few years, particularly with the rise of video-forward, creator-led content,” Amazon said in an emailed statement. “These changes reflect that evolution and will streamline how Wondery integrates further into Amazon. By making these changes, we can better support creators in monetizing their content across multiple channels, help them expand their brand IP, and simplify the process for advertisers while making content more accessible to audiences wherever they prefer to consume it. This evolution builds on Wondery’s early success with video-forward shows and positions us to better serve creators, customers, and advertisers.” Despite securing big names in the business, the company is now shifting its strategy in an effort to better compete with rivals like Spotify and YouTube as the podcasting industry embraces video formats. Update: The article was updated to reflect that Amazon denied reports of Wondery shutting down."

    "full_text": "His work has appeared in The New York Daily News and City & State. Rivian is suing Ohio’s Department of Motor Vehicles over the state’s ban on car companies bypassing dealerships to sell cars directly to consumers. Rivian also notes that Tesla is allowed to sell its vehicles directly to customers in Ohio, which presents an unfair playing field for other EV makers. “Ohio’s prohibition is pure economic protectionism for the benefit of Ohio’s existing auto dealers, putting their profits ahead of consumers.” Dealers have made direct-to-consumer sales as difficult as possible, filing lawsuits and lobbying heavily through their trade group, the National Automobile Dealers Association (NADA). Rivian’s lawsuit accuses the state of carving out deals for Tesla while excluding other similar companies. This imposes an extraordinary burden on Ohio consumers and Rivian for no legitimate reason. This is the first time that Rivian has sued a state over its direct-sales ban. “Consumer choice is a bedrock principle of America’s economy. Meanwhile, Tesla recently settled its lawsuit against Louisiana challenging that state’s direct-sales ban."

    "full_text": "Apple sold its iPhone 16 devices last year with a promise that a new AI-powered version of Siri would soon be a lot more personalized thanks to Apple Intelligence. Almost a year later, that Siri upgrade still isn’t here, and Apple was forced to delay its promised improvements and remove an iPhone 16 commercial instead. Now, Google doesn’t want anyone to forget about this Apple Intelligence debacle. In a new Pixel 10 ad, Google dunks on Apple’s failed promise of Siri AI improvements, with a narrator that suggests you could “just change your phone” if you bought “a new phone because of a feature that’s coming soon, but it’s been coming soon for a full year.” The 30-second spot appeared on YouTube and X today, teasing the launch of Google’s new Pixel 10 devices on August 20th. Google’s latest ad comes just a day after a report from Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman shed some additional light on Apple’s AI delays. In a recent all-hands meeting, Apple’s SVP of software Craig Federighi reportedly put the delay down to Apple’s issues of trying to use a hybrid architecture for Siri. Apple is now reportedly working on a new version of Siri with an updated architecture. “This has put us in a position to not just deliver what we announced, but to deliver a much bigger upgrade than we envisioned,” said Federighi. “There is no project people are taking more seriously.” Federighi previously revealed in June that it was “going to take us longer than we thought” to deliver the promised Siri upgrade."

    "summary": "Elon Musk says the company will bring Vine's archive of videos back online.",
    "full_text": "Elon Musk says he’s bringing back Vine — sort of. Vine — something of a precursor to today’s TikTok, but with only six-second-long looping videos — was acquired by Twitter back in October 2012 for $30 million to expand the social media platform’s video ambitions. Unfortunately for Vine creators and fans, the company fumbled the app’s potential and decided to shut down Vine in 2016 by limiting all new uploads. Despite no longer having an App Store presence, Vine still has a place in the internet’s collective cultural consciousness. Through online compilations of the best Vines uploaded to YouTube, and through the careers of numerous creators who got their start on Vine, the company lives on to some extent, and its content continues to be discovered by new generations. In a poll posted on the social media app, he asked Twitter’s users, “Bring back Vine?” to which nearly 70% responded “yes.” Axios reported at the time that Twitter had devoted some engineers to working on the Vine reboot, but nothing ever came of it. Btw, we recently found the Vine video archive (thought it had been deleted) and are working on restoring user access, so you can post them if you want. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) August 2, 2025 It’s unclear whether Musk has any ambitions for Vine beyond getting its archive back online, however. Whether or not Musk will actually deliver on the promise remains to be seen, as the X post could have just been another way to draw attention to Grok AI, rather than being representative of a real effort inside the company to make old Vines available for reposting."

    "full_text": "Lyft’s European expansion will include Chinese-made robotaxis. The U.S. ride-hailing company announced Monday it has made a strategic partnership with Baidu to deploy the Chinese tech giant’s Apollo Go autonomous vehicles across several European markets. The companies want to launch robotaxi services in Germany and the United Kingdom in 2026, pending regulatory approval. Lyft CEO David Risher said the robotaxi service is an example of its “hybrid network approach, where AVs and human drivers work together to provide customer-obsessed options for riders.” Lyft has historically centered its ride-hailing business on the United States, while rival Uber has expanded globally and into other areas, like food delivery. But earlier this year, Lyft bought its way into the European market when it agreed to acquire the German multi-mobility app FREENOW from BMW and Mercedes-Benz Mobility for about $197 million in cash. Lyft and Uber, both of which sunsetted their own internal autonomous vehicle programs, are in a race to lock up partnerships with companies like Baidu, which have developed the technology. Last month, Uber invested hundreds of millions of dollars into EV maker Lucid and autonomous vehicle technology startup Nuro in a bid to launch its own premium robotaxi service. Lyft hasn’t had the same pace of deals as Uber, but has made a few partnerships in the past year, including a plan to add autonomous shuttles made by Austrian manufacturer Benteler Group to its network in late 2026. Lyft has also said it plans to put AVs from May Mobility on its network in Atlanta later this year."

The list, Google’s 2024 selection of groups and organizations backed by Google’s U.S. Government Affairs and Public Policy team, no longer features the names of 58 DEI groups, including the Latino Leadership Alliance and the ACLU of Illinois. When reached for comment, a spokesperson for Google gave the following statement: “This report mischaracterizes our public policy contributions. We contribute to hundreds of groups from across the political spectrum that advocate for pro-innovation policies, and those groups change from year to year based on where our contributions will have the most impact.” The discovery of the changes comes after the Trump administration said it would target companies openly showing support for DEI. CNBC points out it’s unclear if Google is secretly still supporting these groups, however. This past year, Google said it would no longer have diversity hiring goals, after it removed language referring to “underrepresented” groups from its grant website and removed mention of “diversity” and “equity” from its responsible AI web page; it also removed mention of DEI from its 10-K filings this year. The groups dropped from Google’s funding list had mission statements using words like “race” and “women,” terms the Trump administration instructed federal agencies to dial back on using, the report said. This piece was updated to add a response from Google’s spokesperson."

How to avoid it: Drinking tap water from a stainless steel or glass container can reduce your risk of ingesting plastic particles. How to avoid it: Buying honey from local beekeepers who often use more natural and sustainable harvesting methods may reduce the risk of microplastic contamination. How to avoid it: Wash your fruit thoroughly, peel when possible and opt for local or organic produce. Other potential side effects are hormonal imbalances caused by the endocrine-disrupting chemicals found in plastics. If you can afford it, a special filter will catch microfibers before they pollute water systems. We still have a lot to learn about microplastics and their long-term implications for our health when ingested.

    "full_text": "Researchers at security giant CrowdStrike say they have seen hundreds of cases where North Koreans posing as remote IT workers have infiltrated companies to generate money for the regime, marking a sharp increase over previous years. Per CrowdStrike’s latest threat-hunting report, the company has identified more than 320 incidents over the past 12 months, up by 220% from the year earlier, in which North Koreans gained fraudulent employment at Western companies working remotely as developers. The aim is to generate funds for North Korea’s sanctioned nuclear weapons program, which has so far made billions of dollars for the regime to date. It’s not known exactly how many North Korean IT workers are currently working for unknowing U.S. companies, but some have estimated the number to be in the thousands. According to CrowdStrike, the North Korean IT workers, which the company calls “Famous Chollima” using its naming scheme of hacking groups, rely on generative AI and other AI-powered tools to draft resumes and modify or “deepfake” their appearance during remote interviews. While the scheme is not new, North Koreans are increasingly succeeding at getting jobs, despite sanctions preventing U.S. companies from hiring North Korean workers. CrowdStrike said in its report that one of the ways to prevent hiring sanctioned workers is by implementing better identity verification processes during the hiring phase. TechCrunch has anecdotally heard of some crypto-focused companies asking prospective employees to say critical things about North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong Un, in an effort to weed out potential spies. These operations have included targeting the individuals who run “laptop farm” operations, which include racks of open laptops used by the North Koreans to remotely do their work as if they were physically located in the United States. Prosecutors said in a June indictment that one North Korean operation stole the identities of 80 individuals in the U.S. between 2021 and 2024 to get remote work at more than 100 U.S. companies."

Fabled has 33 cards that we've never seen before, including six Super Rare cards, one of which I'm showing you exclusively today. The card is relatively cheap, with a three-ink cost, but has two decent abilities that could work well with an aggressive ruby/steel deck. Especially helpful if your opponent has sent all their characters out in one go. Getting Challenger +2 on all of your characters when Lilo is played is great, but you'll want to pull her later on in the turn order to make sure you have enough characters on the board to make it worthwhile. Especially helpful if your opponent has sent all their characters out in one go. Go get 'em: This is an ongoing ability that will give any alien character Challenger +2 and the ability to challenge ready characters on the same turn. Pair this with a good Stitch card such as Alien Troublemaker and you could gain some extra lore and draw cards as well. Fabled is due to be released at your local game store on August 29, with a full release in big-box stores on September 5. The trove is big enough to hold just about all of the cards you're likely to buy in each new set, and is a handy way of keeping them separate."

    "summary": "To tackle what's been called the plastic \"epidemic,\" the UN spun up a committee in 2022 tasked with brokering a legally binding global agreement. This ambitious treaty between UN member states was to address the full life cycle of plastics, from production to disposal: In short, define what counts as plastic pollution and curb the sorts of unchecked production that inevitably leads to it. But across five sessions since, countries have failed to reach a consensus on the text.\nWhat was meant to be the final session ended last year in Busan, South Korea without agreement, and representatives from 175 countries are now set to meet again for part two, this time in Geneva, Switzerland. INC-5.2 will take place from August 5 to 14, during which negotiators will attempt to see eye-to-eye on the points of the draft treaty that have thus far proven most contentious. According to the Center for International Environmental Law (CIEL), there are over 370 such points.\nScope\nProduction, the use of chemicals of concern (those considered to be a risk due to toxicity and/or other qualities), product design and the financing of treaty implementation are some of the main points of disagreement. These issues have left countries in a deadlock, according to Cate Bonacini, Communications Manager for CIEL. There are countries that argue health should be excluded from the treaty's scope. These topics will be front-and-center going back into the talks, and UN member states have spent the last eight months \"working hard in closed-door meetings to find points of agreement,\" Bonacini said in an email. \"We’ll see the fruits of that labor soon.\"\n\"At the heart of the issue,\" Bonacini said, \"there is a large disagreement about what plastic pollution is, and what measures are needed to end plastic pollution.\" While the commitment focuses on the full life cycle of plastics, there's been much dispute over where that cycle really begins.\n\"As scientists, we interpret the full life cycle as starting with extraction and production,\" said Bethanie Carney Almroth, a professor of ecotoxicology at the University of Gothenburg and a member of the Scientists' Coalition for an Effective Plastics Treaty. \"That would be fossil fuels and raw plastic production all the way through to product, to use, to trade, to transportation, to waste management, mismanagement and environmental pollution, including remediation of existing legacy plastics. All of it.\"\nWhile over 100 countries last December were in favor of a treaty that would impose production limits, others including Saudi Arabia and Russia opposed the caps. Ahead of that session, the US reportedly also made the decision not to support production caps, despite earlier indications that it would. Unsurprisingly, the countries that have taken issue with the scope of the treaty are also some of the world's top oil producers.\n\"There are other actors,\" Carney Almroth said, \"that are trying to narrow that scope to go from plastic products, like water bottles, to waste management, so sort of excluding the outer boundaries of how we define the plastics life cycle so that it would, in essence, become more of a waste management treaty.\"\nOutside influence\nIn addition to representatives from the participating member states, scientists, environmental organizations and industry lobbyists are present for the negotiation sessions. According to Carney Almroth, who has attended every Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee (INC) meeting and is now in Geneva for INC-5.2, increasingly it's been lobbyists who take up the most space.\n\"At the last round of talks, lobbyists for the petrochemical and plastics industries made up the single largest delegation,\" wrote Bangor University lecturer Winnie Courtene-Jones, who is also a member of the Coalition, in a recent article for The Conversation. CIEL found that \"there were three times more fossil fuel and chemical industry lobbyists than scientists\" at the Busan meetings. Bonacini noted that \"plastics are 99 percent fossil fuels, and these companies have a vested interest in continuing to generate fossil fuel-based products, including plastics.\"\nTheir influence has played a big role in the stalemate. They \"have a lot of power, money and influence,\" Carney Almroth said, \"and their lobbying efforts go beyond the walls of the negotiating space…They have access to decision makers in ways that other observers do not.\"\n\"They don't want to look at chemicals,\" Carney Almroth said. \"They don't want to look at production.\" But the science indicates that looking at chemicals (additives, processing aids, etc.) and production is of utmost importance, not only in the context of environmental sustainability but also human health.\nIn an editorial for the Bulletin of the World Health Organization in July, a group of scientists pointed to the numerous potential health effects that recent studies have linked to plastics, via exposure to hazardous chemicals and from micro- and nanoplastics. That includes an increased risk of \"multiple chronic diseases, including cancer, neurodevelopmental harm and infertility\" as well as \"respiratory, reproductive and gastrointestinal harm, with potential links to lung and colon cancer.\"\nThe authors called on delegates to prioritize these concerns in the upcoming negotiations and work toward a treaty that would end production of toxic chemicals in plastics, ban the recycling of plastics containing those chemicals and reduce plastic production overall. Their letter comes alongside a separate study published this summer in the journal Nature that identified over 4,200 chemicals of concern in plastics, out of the 16,325 total known plastic chemicals. The researchers argue that, on top of establishing transparency around the makeup of plastics and removing chemicals of concern, plastics must be simplified if they're going to be made safer.\nThe many chemicals that go into plastics \"can be released throughout the entire plastic life cycle, from feedstock extraction and production to use and waste,\" the authors write. \"Specific end-of-life treatments, such as uncontrolled landfilling or incineration, can further exacerbate chemical releases.\" The UN has warned that the negative effects at every stage in the life cycle of plastics disproportionately harm vulnerable populations worldwide, including indigenous peoples, low income families and rural communities.\nWhere things stand\nToday, plastic is more or less inescapable — microplastics can even be found in Antarctica now. And research increasingly suggests we aren't fully aware of how bad pollution levels really are.\nGlobal plastic production has more than doubled in the last 25 years, with upwards of 450 million metric tons now estimated to be produced annually. Recycled plastics make up just 6 percent of that total, a figure that's expected to stay the same even as global plastic use and waste generation are projected to rise 70 percent by 2040, according to the international Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). And each year, tens of millions of tons of plastic waste is disposed of in ways considered to be environmentally unsound, ending up in uncontrolled dumpsites, burned openly or accumulating on land and in bodies of water.\nA study published this summer, led by researchers from Utrecht University and the Royal Netherlands Institute for Sea Research, found that there may be far more plastic in the oceans than previously thought when accounting for particles even smaller than microplastics. The team collected water samples from 12 locations across the North Atlantic Ocean and measured the concentration of nanoplastics (plastic particles under 1 micrometer) at different depths. By the researchers' estimate, there could be as much as 27 million metric tons of nanoplastic in the North Atlantic alone. That's in the ballpark of previous global estimates for larger plastic waste across all of the ocean.\nIn another new study, researchers from France's University of Toulouse found we may be breathing in up to 100 times more microplastic particles indoors than previous estimates, based on measurements of airborne microplastics in the researchers' own apartments and car cabins.\nThe situation is urgent, especially for vulnerable populations, said Carney Almroth. \"The amounts of plastics we're producing today and the amount of plastic in the environment are astronomical,\" said Carney Almroth. As of a few years ago, \"we had twice the mass of plastic on the planet as the mass of all the animals on land, in water, including insects, and we have produced far more plastic since then.\"\nPlastics are \"overwhelming any and all of our waste management infrastructure, so we are not able to prevent pollution. We're not able to mitigate harm,\" Carney Almroth said. \"The impacts of plastics in the environment are very large scale, to the point where they're destabilizing vital Earth functions like climate, like nutrient cycling, like biodiversity. And then we have the human health impacts on top of that. It's an acute problem.\"\nThe logistics of averting catastrophe\nBut, as the past five sessions have illustrated, reaching an agreement on how to solve that problem isn't going to be easy. The trouble, in part, boils down to how the decisions are being made. So far, it's all being done by consensus rather than voting, Carney Almroth and Bonacini explained. That approach allows \"a single country veto power over decisions,\" Bonacini said.\nPetrochemical countries including Saudi Arabia, Russia, China, Iran, Kuwait, Qatar, India and Brazil have reportedly latched onto this, using \"obstructionist tactics\" to drag out the negotiations. Some have insisted \"without legal basis,\" according to CIEL, \"that decisions can only be made by consensus.\" Consensus, however, isn't the only option.\nThe draft Rules of Procedure allow for majority voting in the event a consensus can't be reached, but whether that will happen is yet to be seen. \"There are opportunities to force that rule,\" Carney Almroth said. But, a country (or countries) would have to step up and invoke it.\nAt this stage of the negotiations, there is a risk that countries will compromise on key provisions for time's sake, Bonacini said, which would ultimately weaken the treaty. And once a treaty is finalized, \"it can take years, if not decades, to make amendments to the original text,\" so getting it right the first time is crucial. International agreements that have taken a softer approach to addressing environmental issues, like the Paris Agreement — which lets countries set their own targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions — have been criticized for being insufficient in the face of rapidly rising global temperatures and climate change.\nIn June at the UN Ocean Conference, representatives for 95 countries that are part of the INC reaffirmed their commitment to a treaty that addresses the full life cycle of plastics, phases out \"the most problematic plastic products and chemicals of concern,\" improves product design to reduce environmental and health impacts and employs effective means of implementation. \"A treaty that lacks these elements, only relies on voluntary measures or does not address the full lifecycle of plastics will not be effective to deal with the challenge of plastic pollution,\" the group — which includes Canada, Australia, Colombia, Zimbabwe, the UK and Germany — wrote in a joint statement. These countries added that \"the treaty should provide for the possibility of decision-making, through regular UN procedures if all efforts to reach consensus have been exhausted.\"\nIf an agreement isn't reached this time around, there are a number of ways the next steps could play out. The talks could be stretched even further into another meeting, or countries could decide to take the matter somewhere else.\n\"Many countries are considering alternatives if negotiations fail,\" Christina Dixon, Ocean Campaign Lead for the Environmental Investigation Agency told Mongabay. \"Options include returning to the United Nations Environment Assembly (UNEA) to establish a new expanding mandate, creating a convention outside the UN for committed countries to move forward or adopting a protocol under an existing convention.\" The UNEA meets next in December.\nWe are, as Courtene-Jones wrote in The Conversation, at \"a critical crossroads.\" That's something advocates for a strong, science-based treaty all seem to agree on. \"There are a lot of places where we can really do a lot to make a difference, and make things better,\" said Carney Almroth. \"Countries need to be ambitious, and need to stand up and demand this.\"This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/science/will-the-un-finally-broker-a-treaty-to-end-plastic-pollution-130022025.html?src=rss",

    "full_text": "Apple's iPhone 17 is expected to launch in a matter of weeks at its September event. But the long-rumored foldable iPhone Flip isn't expected to be part of this year's launch. Apple dominates in the premium phone category, but foldables -- which fit into the premium space in terms of price -- are already nipping at its heels, with Motorola telling CNET that 20% of customers buying its Razr foldable jumped ship from Apple. Meanwhile, Samsung is in the seventh generation of its Flip and Fold series. As Lisa Eadicicco discovered during a visit to Seoul, \"foldables are everywhere\" in Samsung's home country of South Korea. With nearly every major Android phone-maker entering the foldable market, Apple risks losing potential customers. It's estimated that around 20 million foldables from all manufacturers were sold worldwide in 2023, while Apple reportedly sold 26.5 million iPhone 14 Pro Max handsets in the first half of that year alone. Google's Pixel Fold is a decent phone, but it doesn't drive the category forward in any meaningful way. Apple would be able to change that, as it proved with the iPhone and iPad. Given Apple's close relationships with top-tier developers -- not to mention its own vast developer team -- I expect an eventual Apple foldable to offer innovations that make it more than just an iPhone that folds in half."

    "summary": "It’s obvious that Apple products are some of the most sought-after in the tech world — that means sales are fewer and farther between than other gadgets, and they’re often the first things to sell out when discounts do arrive. But it would be a mistake to assume you’re doomed to always pay full price on things like iPads and Apple Watches. Apple deals to exist, if you know where to look.Engadget keeps track of deals like these on a regular basis, so we can help you there. Below, we’ve collected the best Apple deals you can get right now on items like AirPods, MacBooks, iPads and more. Arguably the biggest caveat to note about Apple sales is that you’re almost never going to see discounts directly at Apple.com. Unless you shop refurbished, you’ll always pay top dollar direct at Apple, and for some things (like iPhones), that might be best. But you’ll find more discounts more often if you’re willing to shop at retailers like Amazon, Best Buy, Walmart, Target and others.\nBest MacBook deals\n \nApple MacBook Air (15-inch, M4) for $999 ($200 off): The 15-inch MacBook Air is nearly identical to the smaller version but features more robust speakers and a more spacious trackpad alongside its roomier display. $999 is the lowest price we've tracked. \nApple MacBook Air (15-inch, M3, 24GB RAM) for $1,299 ($400 off): The last-gen M3 MacBook Air has officially been discontinued, but it remains a superb laptop while the last bits of stock remain available. We gave this 15-inch model a score of 90 in our review — outside of its slower chip (which is still plenty fast for everyday use), marginally improved camera and inability to power two external displays with the lid open, it's virtually identical to the newer version. This deal applies to the model with the larger 24GB of memory in the Starlight colorway.\nApple iMac 24-inch (M4) for $1,185 (9 percent off): For an all-in-one solution, the M4 iMac is a good pick thanks to its powerful performance, standard 16GB of RAM and improved webcam. Just note that it only comes in the 24-inch screen size option. $1,149 is the lowest price we've tracked, but note that the deal only applies to the Pink model. Other colors are also on sale, but more expensive. \nBest Apple Watch deals\n \nApple Watch Ultra 2 for $650 ($149 off): Apple’s most premium smartwatch, the Ultra 2 has a killer 36-hour battery life, a handy Low Power mode for extended use and cellular connectivity by default. It also has a compass app, water temperature gauge and a loud onboard siren that you can trigger in emergencies. This deal applies to the watch with the orange band. $650 is the lowest price we've tracked. \nApple Watch SE for $169 (32 percent off): We wouldn’t be surprised to see an update to Apple’s budget smartwatch sometime soon (and we have a few suggestions on the matter). But thanks to some serious discounts, the Apple Watch SE has turned out to be the most affordable way to get an iPhone companion for your wrist. Despite the lackluster screen and limited extra features, it handles the basics well. Also available at Walmart.\nBest AirPods deals\n \nAirPods Max (USB-C) for $450 ($99 off): If you’re looking for over-ear headphones with all of the conveniences of in-ear AirPods, the AirPods Max are one of your only options (with the others being Beats devices). The latest models have the same design as the originals, but now charge up via USB-C instead of Lightning. They went as low as $430 for Amazon's Prime Day. \nBest iPad deals\n \niPad Pro (M4, 11-inch) for $899 ($100 off): The most powerful iPad is the iPad Pro, and it’s the one to get if you’re even toying with the idea of using your new slab as a laptop replacement. Both the 11- and 13-inch models have gorgeous displays, thinner and lighter designs, a repositioned front camera and the excessively powerful M4 chip inside. Also at B&H Photo.\nBest Apple accessories deals\nApple Pencil (USB-C) for $69 ($10 off): This more affordable Apple Pencil doesn’t support pressure sensitivity, but it still makes for a useful stylus for the basics. If you’re a casual note-taker and can live without wireless charging, you’ll save a few bucks by picking this one up. Also available at Walmart.\nApple Pencil (2nd gen) for $99 ($30 off): The Second gen Pencil both attaches and charges magnetically, supports tilt and pressure sensitivity and allows for tool changes with a tap of the flat edge. It’s an older pencil and isn’t compatible with the latest iPad models. This is the lowest price we’ve tracked this year, but it went as low as $80 for last year’s Black Friday sales.\nRead more Apple coverage:\n\nThe best AirPods\nThe best Apple Watches\nThe best MacBooks\nThe best iPhones\nThe best iPads\n\nFollow @EngadgetDeals on X for the latest tech deals and buying advice.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/best-apple-deals-150020110.html?src=rss",

    "full_text": "The phone is expected to debut in early September, although Apple hasn't confirmed anything yet. Perhaps the biggest looming question is whether iPhones could get pricier, especially with tariffs. President Donald Trump has said Apple will have to pay a 25% tariff on iPhones made outside the US. This could especially be helpful with the slimmer iPhone 17 Air, which will likely also have a thinner battery. With iOS 26, the Camera app also adopts a more minimalistic design and Photos once again makes it easier to find your albums by adding separate tabs for your Library and Collections, instead of forcing you to scroll through a single cluttered screen. We expect the iPhone 17 to become available in September although it's not yet clear exactly when, as Apple hasn't confirmed anything. Historically, Apple has unveiled its new iPhones on the first Tuesday of September after Labor Day. That would mean the phones could then become available on either Sept. 12 or 19. Preorders would kick off a week before general availability, on either Sept. 5 or 12. Bloomberg's Mark Gurman has said that the new iPhone announcement should come Sept. 9 or 10."

    "full_text": "With WatchOS 26 now in public beta, we're getting a telling preview of what's coming to Apple Watches this fall. After using Gemini AI on the Galaxy Watch 8, it's painfully clear just how far Siri is lagging. It handles complex prompts in one go, summarizes aloud and spares you from dead-end results or clunky app handoffs. The Ultra 2 and Series 10 already made strides by enabling on-device Siri for tasks like starting or stopping workouts without needing a phone nearby. The Ultra line has already shown what's possible, pushing up to two days of battery life at full throttle (or 72 hours in low power mode). Blood pressure monitoring might be the most requested health feature I see (based on my very unscientific comment section data). The Apple Watch does have a UV Index complication option on some of its watchfaces but it's passive and easy to ignore. Apple should make this standard across the board, just like Samsung did with its Galaxy Watch 8 lineup. Now we're crossing into software wishlist territory but I'd love to see full-fledged apps like WhatsApp on the watch with full call and message capabilities. But gestures still feel underused (at least by this reviewer), mainly because you can't customize them much beyond the limited list that Apple provides."

Open the default camera app and you're met with a neat interface, comprised mostly of the shutter button and zoom levels, with other shooting modes found alongside. It doesn't try to overcomplicate things here, instead letting you quickly shoot images without messing about with settings. The camera's simple software makes it easy to take photos with little effort on your part. The Pixel does offer deeper control if you want it, conveniently hidden behind a small settings icon, rather than requiring you to switch completely into a \"Pro\" mode. For those of you wanting to take manual control of your white balance to warm up a beautiful sunset, the Pixel 9 Pro offers an easy way in. Google has clearly taken notes from Apple's approach in making the Pixel range. Apple's phones may be derided by Android fans for their lack of customization and \"locked down\" nature, but iPhones are famously more simple to operate."

    "summary": "Most people think of AirTags when they picture a Bluetooth tracker. And indeed, Apple’s little white discs used to be the most capable option, relying on a vast finding network of nearby iPhones to pinpoint lost tags. But now, both Google and Samsung have implemented finding networks of their own. And other Bluetooth tracker companies, like Chipolo and Pebblebee, now have trackers that pair with either Google or Apple’s network too. In short, you’ve got a lot of options for tagging and tracking your keys, backpacks, luggage and more. So we tested all the major brands out there to see how they work and put together a guide to help you get the most out of your chosen tracker. Here are the best Bluetooth trackers you can buy.\nTable of contents\n\nThe best Bluetooth trackers for 2025\nWhat to look for in a Bluetooth tracking device\nHow we tested Bluetooth trackers \nOther Bluetooth trackers we tested \nBluetooth tracker FAQs\n\nBest Bluetooth trackers for 2025\n \n \n \n \nWhat to look for in a Bluetooth tracking device\nBluetooth trackers are small discs or cards that rely on short-range, low-energy wireless signals to communicate with your smartphone. Attach one of these gadgets your stuff and, if it’s in range, your phone can “ring” the chip so you can find it. These tracking devices offer other features like separation alerts to tell you when you’ve left a tagged item behind, or where a lost item was last detected. Some can even tap into a larger network of smartphones to track down your device when you’re out of range. Depending on what you want the tracker to do, there are a few specs to look for when deciding which to get. \nDevice compatibility\nLike most things from the folks in Cupertino, AirTags only work with products in the Apple ecosystem. Both Apple and Google have opened up access to the Find My and Find Hub networks to third-party manufacturers, including Chipolo and Pebblebee. Those two companies make device-agnostic models that will work with the larger tracking network from either brand, so iPhone and Android users can buy the same tag. Tile trackers work with either Android or Apple devices, but use Tile’s own Life 360 finding network. Samsung’s latest fob, the Galaxy SmartTag2, only works with Samsung phones and taps into a finding system that relies on other Samsung devices to locate lost tags.\nFinding network\nCrowd-sourced finding capabilities are what make headlines, with stories about recovering stolen equipment or tracking lost luggage across the globe. Using anonymous signals that ping other people’s devices, these Bluetooth tracking devices can potentially tell you where a tagged item is, even if your smartphone is out of Bluetooth range.\nApple’s Find My network is the largest, with over a billion iPhones and iPads in service all running Apple’s Find My app by default. So unless an iPhone user opts out, their phone silently acts as a location detector for any nearby AirTags. Apple recently increased the AirTag’s finding power by enabling you to share the location of a lost tag with a third party, party, like an airline. Chipolo fobs that work on Apple’s network have the same ability. Google launched its Find My Device network in 2024 and has since renamed it Find Hub, which, like Apple's fining app, combines devices and people finding in one place. That network is now a close second for the largest in the US\nNow that Google’s Find Hub network is up and running, it’s a close second for the largest in the US. Like Apple, Android users are automatically part of the network, but can opt-out by selecting the Google services option in their phone’s Settings app and toggling the option in the Find Hub menu. Samsung’s SmartTag 2 and related network also defaults to an opt-in status for finding tags and other devices.\nTile offers a large finding grid that includes Tile users, Amazon Sidewalk customers and people running the Life360 network. Life360 acquired Tile in 2021, and, according to the company, the Life360 network has more than 70 million monthly active users.\nIn our tests, AirTags and third-party tags using its network, like the Chipolo Pop and Pebblebee Clip Universal, were the fastest to track down lost items. They offered nearly real-time location data in moderately to heavily trafficked spots around Albuquerque, including a bar, bookstore and coffee shops in Nob Hill, along with various outdoor hangouts on UNM’s campus.\nSamsung's SmartTags were able to locate our lost items most of the time, though not with the same precision finding accuracy as AirTags. When we tested Google’s Find Hub (then called Find My Device) network right after launch, it was noticeably slower than Apple’s network when using the community finding feature. Testing it again in 2025, the time it took to locate a lost item was considerably improved, taking just a couple minutes for the community to track a fob. In our tests, Tile’s finding network wasn’t able to consistently locate its lost fobs.\n\n\n\n\n   Amy Skorheim / Engadget \n \n\nSeparation alerts\nHere’s where a tracker’s day-to-day utility really shines. A separation alert lets you know when you’ve traveled too far from your tagged items, which is useful if you want to make sure your laptop bag, or jacket or umbrella always comes with you when you leave the house.\nThese notifications work when you’re out and about too. If you’ve got a Bluetooth tracking device in your wallet and walk out of a restaurant without it, the separation alert should kick in, resulting in fewer lost items. This feature also tells you where your tagged item and phone were last paired, allowing you to retrace your steps if you happen to miss the alert.\nEach tracker handles left-behind items differently. AirTags and third-party fobs using its network (such as from Chipolo or Pebblebee) include the feature by default. Tile trackers require a yearly subscription to enable the alerts (currently $30 annually). Tags working with the Google's Find Hub network don’t offer the feature at all, but Chipolo Pop tags can issue left-behind alerts using its own Android app. Both AirTags and Tiles allow you to turn off separation alerts at certain locations, meaning you can set your home as a “safe” place where items can be left behind, but alerts will still trigger elsewhere.\nIn our tests, AirTags and others using the Find My network alerted us between the 600- and 1,400-foot mark. Tiles sent a notification after about an average of 1,500 feet and were more consistent when using an Android phone than an iPhone. Chipolo Pop tags paired with an Android phone and using its own app sent an alert when we got around 450 feet away from our tagged item.\nConnectivity, volume and design\nThe feature you may use most often is the key finder function, which makes the tracker ring when you hit a button in the app. With Apple's AirTags, you can say \"Hey Siri, where are my keys?\" and the assistant will ring the tag (assuming it doesn't mistakenly think you're asking for directions to the Floridian archipelago). You can also use the Find Item app in your Apple Watch to ring your fob. Asking smart home/personal assistants like Alexa or the Google Assistant to find your keys will work with Chipolo, Tile and Pebblebee trackers linked to your Android device.\nIf you have your tag but can’t find your phone, some trackers will let you ring them to find your handset. SmartTag2 fobs reliably rang our Galaxy phone when we double-pressed it. Tile trackers have the same feature. Chipolo Pop trackers can ring your phone, but uses the Chipolo app to do so, which can run concurrently with the Find My or Find Hub connection. AirTags and any third-party tags using only Apple or Google’s networks don’t offer this feature.\nThe volume of the Bluetooth tracking device may determine whether you can find an item buried in your couch cushions or in a noisy room. AirTags have a reputation for being on the quiet side, and that aligned with what we saw (measuring roughly 65 decibels). Chipolo’s Pop tags and Tile’s Pro model measure between 83 and 86 decibels on average. Pebblebee’s new Clip Universal was the loudest of any tag we’ve tested, clocking in at 91 ear-splitting decibels.\nDesign will determine what you can attach the tracker to. AirTags are small, smooth discs that can’t be secured to anything without accessories, which are numerous, but that is an additional cost to consider. Chipolo, Pebblebee and Tile offer trackers with holes that easily attach to your key ring, and all three companies also offer card-shaped versions designed to fit in your wallet. Pebblebee Clip Universal tags come with a handy carabiner-style key ring.\nBatteries are replaceable for AirTag, Tile Pro, SmartTag2 and Chipolo Pop fobs and each should go for at least a year before needing to be swapped. Tile Mate and card-shaped trackers don’t have replaceable batteries, which means you’ll have to replace the entire unit whenever it dies. Pebblebee trackers are rechargeable in both the disc and wallet variety. They’re also the only tags equipped with onboard LEDs.\nStalking, theft and data privacy\nAirTags have gotten a lot of attention and even prompted some lawsuits for Apple due to bad actors planting them on people in order to stalk them. While this fact may not influence your buying decision, any discussion of Bluetooth trackers should note what steps Apple, Google and Tile have taken to address the issue. Last year, all the major players in the Bluetooth tracker business teamed up to combat misuse and standardize how unauthorized tracking detection and alerts work for iOS and Android.\nLast year, Tile launched a feature called Anti-Theft Mode, which enables you to render one of its trackers undetectable by others. That means if someone steals your tagged item, they won’t be able to use the anti-stalking features to find and disable the tracker. That sort of negates one of the major ways potential stalking victims can stay safe, so Tile hopes ID verification and a $1 million penalty will deter misuse. Separately, Tile was hit by a data breach, raising different privacy concerns. The company issued a statement about the event, which it shared with Engadget:\n\nSimilar to many other companies, Life360 recently became the victim of a criminal extortion attempt. We received emails from an unknown actor claiming to possess Tile customer information. We promptly initiated an investigation into the potential incident and detected unauthorized access to a Tile customer support platform (but not our Tile service platform). The potentially impacted data consists of information such as names, addresses, email addresses, phone numbers, and Tile device identification numbers. It does not include more sensitive information, such as credit card numbers, passwords or log-in credentials, location data, or government-issued identification numbers, because the Tile customer support platform did not contain these information types.\n\n\nWe believe this incident was limited to the specific Tile customer support data described above and is not more widespread. We take this event and the security of customer information seriously. We have taken and will continue to take steps designed to further protect our systems from bad actors, and we have reported this event and the extortion attempt to law enforcement. We remain committed to keeping families safe online and in the real world.\n\nAs a theft deterrent, a Bluetooth tracker may or may not be the best option. Anecdotal stories abound in which people have recovered stolen goods using a tracker — but other tales are more cautionary. Neither Apple nor Google promotes its trackers or finding networks as a way to deal with theft. GPS trackers, on the other hand, are typically marketed for just that purpose.\nHow we tested Bluetooth trackers\nBefore deciding on which trackers to test, we researched the field, looking at user reviews on Amazon, Best Buy and other retailers, along with discussions on sites like Reddit. We also checked out what other publications had to say on the matter before narrowing down our options to Apple AirTag, Tile, and Chipolo trackers. When Samsung's SmartTag 2 came out in October of 2023, we added that to our testing, along with Pebblebee's rechargeable Clip tracker. After Google launched its finding network (now called Find Hub), both Chipolo and Pebblebee released trackers in 2025 that work with either network and we tested the Pop and Universal key fob models and updated our top picks accordingly.\nHere’s the full list of every tracker we tested:\n\nApple AirTag\nChipolo Card Spot\nChipolo One Spot\nChipolo One\nChipolo Card\nChipolo Pop\nPebblebe Clip Universal\nPebblebee Clip\nSamsung SmartTag 2\nChipolo One Point\nPebblebee Clip for Android\nTile Pro (2024)\nTile Mate (2024)\nTile Mate (2022)\nTile Pro (2022)\nTile Slim (2022)\n\nAfter acquiring the trackers, I tested each one over the course of a few weeks using both an iPhone 11 and a Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra. I recreated likely user experiences, such as losing and leaving items behind at home and out in the city. I planted trackers at different spots near downtown Albuquerque, mostly concentrated in and around the University of New Mexico and the surrounding neighborhood of Nob Hill. Later, I conducted tests in the Queen Anne neighborhood of Seattle. Each test was performed multiple times, both while walking and driving and I used the measure distance feature on Google Maps to track footage for alerts. I paid attention to how easy the app was to use, how reliable the phone-to-tracker connection was and any other perks and drawbacks that came up during regular use.\nAs new trackers come to market, or as we learn of worthy models to try, I'll test them and add the results to this guide. I'm currently in the process of obtaining Motorola Moto tags and look forward to seeing how they work with an Android phone. \nOther Bluetooth trackers we tested\nTile Pro and Tile Mate (2024)\nTile recently came out with a new suite of trackers, replacing the Tile Mate, Tile Pro, Tile Sticker and Tile Slim with updated models. In addition to fun new colors for the Mate and Slim, Tile added an SOS feature that can send a notification to your Life360 Circle when you triple press the button on the tracker. It’s a clever addition that turns your keys into a panic button, something offered by personal safety companies as standalone devices.\nThere are a few caveats: You and the people you want to notify in an emergency will need the Life360 app installed on your phones. If you want your Tile to also trigger a call to emergency services, you’ll need a $15-per-month Life360 subscription (that’s in addition to a Tile membership, which starts at $3/month or $30 annually). And enabling the SOS triple-press disables the ability to ring your phone with the fob.\nI tested the SOS feature and it did indeed send a text message to my Circle, with the message that I had triggered an SOS and a link to a website that showed my current location. I thought it odd that the link didn’t open the Life360 app (which shows the location of users' phones), but I wasn’t as much concerned with Tile’s personal safety features as I was with the tracking capabilities, which turned out to be less than ideal.\nFor my tests, I planted Tile trackers in a densely populated area of Seattle (about 15,000 people per square mile). After setting the trackers to “lost” in the Tile app, I waited. After four hours, one of the trackers was not discovered by the finding community, so I went and retrieved it. Another fob I planted alerted me that the tracker had been found by the Tile community after three hours — but the location it gave me was off by a third of a mile. I then decided to plant a tracker in the most populated place I could think of — the dried fruit and nuts aisle of a Trader Joes on a Friday evening before a major holiday. It still took over a half an hour before another Tile user anonymously pinged my lost tracker.\nIn my tests with Samsung’s trackers and the fobs on Google’s Find Hub network, it took around ten minutes for them to be discovered. AirTags took half that time and all were tested in a far less populated city. Four hours with no ping and over a half hour before getting a hit in a crowded TJs were pretty long stretches.\nOur top pick, the classic Chipolo, has virtually no finding network. But if you’re getting a tracker for that feature alone, you should go with AirTags if you have an iPhone or the Google-enabled Chipolo or Pebblebee trackers if you use an Android phone. We prefer the Chipolo because it works with either iOS or Android devices, it rings loud, it’s quick to tell you when you’ve left it behind and it connects nearly instantly when you’re searching for a misplaced tracker around the house.\nTile devices also work with both mobile operating systems and its latest models are indeed louder than they were before. But they aren’t as quick to connect and you need to pay for a membership to activate left-behind alerts. And when you do, those notifications don’t kick in as quickly as they do with competing trackers.\nBluetooth tracker FAQs\nWhich Bluetooth tracker has the longest range?\nBoth the Tile Pro and the Samsung Galaxy SmartTag2 claim a maximum range of around 400 feet, which is longer than the 300-foot claim for Chipolo’s Pop tags. The Pebblebee Clip Universal claims a 500-foot range, though other trackers with a shorter claimed range performed better in our tests. Apple doesn’t make range claims for AirTags. Any Bluetooth signal, of course, is dependent on a few factors. Obstacles like walls and people can block the signal, so a clear line of sight is the only way to achieve the maximum range. Other signals, like Wi-Fi, can also interfere with Bluetooth connections. Even high humidity can have an effect and lessen the distance at which your phone will connect to your tracker.\nRemember, when considering the range of Bluetooth trackers, the size of the “finding network” also comes into play. This is the number of nearby phones that can be used to anonymously ping your tracker when your own phone is out of Bluetooth range. As of now, Apple AirTags have the largest network, followed by Google’s Find Hub, Samsung’s finding community and Tile’s Life360 members.\nWhat is the best Bluetooth tracker for a car?\nBluetooth trackers are designed to track small, personal items like keys, jackets, backpacks and the like. All trackers have safeguards to prohibit the tag from being used to stalk people, so most will alert someone if a tracker that does not belong to them is detected following them. That means a car thief may get tipped off that there’s a tracker in the car they’re trying to steal. That said, you’ll see plenty of stories about people finding their car thanks to a Bluetooth tracker. Some police departments have even handed out trackers to combat high rates of carjacking. In most instances, the tracker of choice has been AirTags thanks to their wide finding network. If you’re looking for a tracker for your car, you may want to look into GPS trackers, some of which are designed for just that purpose.\nHow accurate are Bluetooth trackers?\nAccuracy for Bluetooth trackers can be looked at in two ways: Finding items nearby and finding items misplaced outside your home. For nearby items, you’ll most often use the ring function on the device to hunt it down. Two tags, Apple’s AirTags and Samsung’s Galaxy SmartTag2, also use ultra-wideband technology, which creates directional navigation on your phone to get you within a foot of the tracker.\nAccurately finding lost items outside your home depends on the size of the finding network. Since this relies on the serendipity of a random phone passing within Bluetooth range of your tracker, the more phones on a given network, the better. And since Bluetooth ranges and distance estimates are only precise within about a meter or so, getting pings from more than one phone will help locating items. Here again, it’s worth noting that Apple’s Find My network is the largest, followed by Google, Samsung and Tile (both Chipolo and Pebblebee have fobs that work with the Apple and Google networks).\nRecent Updates\nAugust 2025: Updated the name of Google's finding network to Find Hub, instead of Find My Device. Added details about Pebblebee's new Alert feature. Added a table of contents. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-bluetooth-tracker-140028377.html?src=rss",
    "full_text": "It’s an oblong fob with a big hole for attaching directly to your keys, or you can buy the optional silicone case and ring Samsung offers. Bluetooth trackers are small discs or cards that rely on short-range, low-energy wireless signals to communicate with your smartphone. Crowd-sourced finding capabilities are what make headlines, with stories about recovering stolen equipment or tracking lost luggage across the globe. So unless an iPhone user opts out, their phone silently acts as a location detector for any nearby AirTags. AirTags and third-party fobs using its network (such as from Chipolo or Pebblebee) include the feature by default. AirTags have a reputation for being on the quiet side, and that aligned with what we saw (measuring roughly 65 decibels). We believe this incident was limited to the specific Tile customer support data described above and is not more widespread. I'm currently in the process of obtaining Motorola Moto tags and look forward to seeing how they work with an Android phone. For my tests, I planted Tile trackers in a densely populated area of Seattle (about 15,000 people per square mile). That said, you’ll see plenty of stories about people finding their car thanks to a Bluetooth tracker."

    "full_text": "I think of the Blink Outdoor 4 as a \"jack of all trades\" outdoor camera, which is why it has earned a spot on my best picks for home security cameras as best camera for battery life. I often find myself recommending it for someone who wants an all-purpose camera at a fairly affordable price of $100. Unlike some batteries with \"lithium\" in the name these aren't rechargeable. They offer other benefits instead, including extra power compared to traditional AA batteries and an elongated shelf life of up to 25 years, so you can buy a pack without worrying about them dying out. Blink's app also serves up motion and human detection alerts according to your settings. With extra-long battery life, a solar panel is less necessary, but this is an option if you are putting your Blink camera in a sunny spot and never really want to worry about battery life at all. Lights: 1 blue LED to help you know when it's active (optional). Blink's Outdoor 4 camera combines ease of use and battery life, two things that really make a difference. For me, it's well worth the extra $4 to replace them every year or two. The Blink Outdoor 4 should certainly be on your list if you're looking for a wireless camera."

We're excited to get our hands on some of the newest Switch 2 accessories (more on those below), but plenty of our favorite classics are compatible with the Switch 2 as well as older versions of the console.

    "full_text": "The Switch 2 Pro controller is the best controller Nintendo has ever made – and that’s saying something. It’s incredibly comfortable to hold, its joysticks are buttery smooth, and all of its buttons are wonderfully responsive. Nintendo even made it customizable this time with rear buttons that can easily be mapped inside of any game. The Switch 2 Pro Controller costs $85, which seems a bit egregious when you can get an excellent controller like 8BitDo’s Ultimate 2 wireless gamepad for $60. As good as the competition is, though, you won’t find anything that can be easily configured directly from within the Switch 2’s user interface. My hands often feel cramped when I play that game with the Switch 2’s Joy-Con 2 controllers for too long. But there’s none of that with the Switch 2 Pro controller. I was able to race for an hour without any discomfort, and I also noticed that it was easier for me to pull off the game’s tricky jump maneuvers and rail sliding. The Switch 2 Pro controller is also seriously helpful with fighting games, thanks to its smooth and accurate directional pad. It acquits itself to most genres easily, though it would have been nice to see analog triggers for more precise control in serious racing games."

Gurman also notes that Apple is advertising for jobs with this team, specifically looking for applicants who have experience with search algorithms and engine development. While Apple has already integrated ChatGPT into Siri, a more personalized, AI-powered update to the voice assistant has been repeatedly delayed.

The result, at least from the few hours of Battlefield 6 multiplayer I played, is a polished shooter with a lot of focus on making skirmishes exciting at any scale. Domination ditches vehicles for small-scale squad battles that rack up points with captured zones, king-of-the-hill style. Squad Deathmatch is a simple four-squad competition for who reaches the kill limit first. But the quick time-to-kill made it feel like any moment I wasn't ready to snap my assault rifle to someone popping out of a corner would be a duel I'd lose. At the best moments, I was in tune with my squad, often using the new anyone-can-revive feature to put my teammates back on their feet (Support class does this faster). As I played these maps over and over again, I saw how certain high-traffic zones would get obliterated by the time the match ended, with buildings reduced to rubble and areas around objectives flattened. Then they can combine this with other items like the assault ladder gadget, which Andersson notes could give squads second-floor access to surprise enemies. In that, it's looking like Battlefield 6 could be what those nostalgic gamers are waiting for. Battlefield 6 launches on Oct. 10 for PC, PS5 and Xbox Series X/S."

The birding section at my local plant nursery displays signs showing which seed is best for attracting certain species of birds. The company offers an assortment of bird food ranging from suet cakes to high-quality seed blends. Avoid setting out human food or snacks to protect your wild bird visitors and their digestive health. Securing food sources can be an easy adjustment to help keep wildlife from developing a habit of visiting your yard,\" said Hubbard. I have two different types of feeders: a hanging tray and the Bird Buddy Smart Feeder. Use high-quality feed and avoid offering human food or snacks, as many are toxic to birds. If you have questions regarding your birding journey, the National Audubon Society is an excellent resource for bird feeding and care.

The pot the Piranha Plant sits in functions as both a stand and USB extension for the device. The plant itself detaches from the pot, so the camera can be used in portable mode by popping it into the USB port at the top of the console.\nThere's also a built-in privacy shutter. Just close the plant's mouth to obscure the lens. The actual camera specs here aren't going to win any awards, with a frame rate of 30FPS and a resolution of 640 x 480p. However, that's more than enough to capture footage of your floating head to accompany your kart as it races through the Mushroom Kingdom.\nFollow @EngadgetDeals on X for the latest tech deals and buying advice.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-hori-piranha-plant-camera-for-switch-2-is-on-sale-for-only-40-145031271.html?src=rss",
    "full_text": "Engadget has been testing and reviewing consumer tech since 2004. Even though the Switch 2 basically just came out, we're already starting to see discounts on some of its accessories. One of the more charming peripherals, the HORI Piranha Plant camera, is on sale right now for only $40. That's $20 off and a record-low price. It's a good deal for anyone who wants to take advantage of the Switch 2's camera functionality in games like Mario Kart World and that recently-released campfire sim.

On Friday, a circuit judge from the US Court of Appeals ruled that X Corp. has to again face claims that it was negligent in taking down child sex abuse content and didn't have an effective reporting infrastructure for these offenses.\nThis ruling from Judge Danielle Forrest is the latest step in a lawsuit filed in 2021 against Twitter, before it was rebranded to X. The suit lists two underage boys as the plaintiffs and alleges Twitter, now X, \"slow-walked its response to reports about, and did not immediately remove from the platform, pornographic content that a trafficker had coerced plaintiffs into producing.\"\nA previous decision with a three-judge panel unanimously decided that X was legally immune thanks to Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which offers wide-reaching protections to online platforms from the content that's posted by its users. This latest decision from Judge Forrest agrees with parts of the previous ruling, but claims that X was negligent in this case and has to defend itself against the lawsuit's claims that the platform makes it \"too difficult to report child pornography that is posted on Twitter.\"\nThe case revolves around a 13-year-old and a 14-year-old boy who were tricked by online sex traffickers into sending sexually explicit photos, according to the lawsuit.

The boy's mother also filed a report, didn't receive anything but an automated response, and had to follow up before receiving a response that Twitter didn't find any policy violations and wouldn't take further action, according to the lawsuit. The suit claimed that Twitter eventually removed the post nine days after the initial report, suspended the poster's account and reported the content to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, which is required by federal law. The lawsuit could set a major precedent in how social media platforms operate, especially if it makes it to the Supreme Court, but X will first have to defend itself against these claims again in district court thanks to this latest decision.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/x-has-to-prove-it-wasnt-negligent-when-removing-csam-from-its-site-173645506.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Whew, it's been a crazy few weeks for us at Engadget. School may still be out, but there's no summer break for the steady stream of new gadgets coming across our desks. I'll forgive you if you missed a review or two over the last few weeks — we've been busy. Here's a quick rundown of what we've been up to, just in time for you to catch up over the weekend. \nSamsung Z Flip 7\n \nAlongside the Z Fold 7, Samsung debuted an updated version of its more compact foldable, the Z Flip 7. UK bureau chief Mat Smith noted that the company managed to provide a substantial overhaul, but there are some areas that were left untouched. \"Certain aspects of the Flip 7 are lacking, most notably the cameras, which haven’t been changed since last year,\" he said. \"Samsung also needs to put more work into its Flex Window.\" \nOakley Meta glasses\n \nMeta's first non-Ray-Ban smart glasses have arrived. While we wait for a more affordable version to get here, senior editor Karissa Bell put the white and gold option through its paces. \"While I don't love the style of the Oakley Meta HSTN frames, Meta has shown that it's been consistently able to improve its glasses,\" she wrote. \"The upgrades that come with the new Oakley frames aren't major leaps, but they deliver improvements to core features.\"\nDJI Osmo 360\n \nReporter Steve Dent argued that DJI is finally giving Insta360 some competition in the 360-degree action cam space.

    "summary": "Welcome to our latest recap of what's going on in the indie game space. A bunch of new games dropped this week that are more than worthy of your attention, including a modern take on an old-school Ninja Gaiden side-scroller and a joyful (perhaps even profound) puzzler about the life of a housefly.\nBy far the biggest story in indie games over the last few weeks concerns payment processors pressuring the likes of Steam owner Valve and Itch to remove or de-index games that feature adult, NSFW and LGBTQIA+ themes. Under the guise of helping to protect women and children, an conservative activist group in Australia has taken credit for the delistings, as well as stricter rules regarding adult-themed games that Steam and Itch have implemented. But some affected developers suggest this is a smokescreen to push forward an agenda of anti-LGBTQIA+ censorship.\nThis week, Engadget senior editor Jess Conditt spoke with solo developer Cara Cadaver of Final Girl Games about the impact of the censorship campaign. Valve permanently banned Cadaver's new game, VILE: Exhumed, from Steam for allegedly depicting \"sexual content with depictions of real people,\" though the developer says that assessment is inaccurate. While Cadaver and publisher DreadXP are working on alternative distribution for VILE: Exhumed, Steam is the go-to marketplace for many PC gamers and the ban cuts off what surely would have been a critical source of revenue for the game.\nFor its part, Itch has started reindexing free adult-themed games on its platform. The company has relied on Stripe and Paypal for processing payments. It has suspended payments via Stripe for 18+ content and it's talking to other potential payment partners \"that are more willing to work with this kind of content.\" In any case, payment processors should not be the arbiters of morality, and they certainly should not be helping activists restrict access to perfectly above-board works of art.\nOne other piece of news that caught my eye this week is about a game jam that's taking place this month. Participants will have just over three weeks to make games based on real-life investigative reporting. According to Global Game Jam, the teams will gain access to exclusive reporting on organized crime and corruption from around the world and be able to ask journalists behind those stories questions about their work. It's a fascinating idea, and I'm really looking forward to seeing what the developers that get involved come up with.\nNew releases\n\nNinja Gaiden: Ragebound is what I like to call a “hell yeah\" game. There are few purer joys than getting about 15-20 minutes into a new game and thinking “hell yeah, this rules.” Even better, that feeling lasted through the other four hours or so I spent with Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound.\nThis is a throwback 2D hack-and-slash platformer from The Game Kitchen — the studio behind the Blasphemous series — and publisher Dotemu, which is building quite the reputation for itself as a purveyor of retro-style games (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge, the upcoming Marvel Cosmic Invasion). Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound looks and sounds sumptuous, with gorgeous pixel art and stellar level, character and audio design. It’s got combat that's somehow both sticky and slick, and it’s challenging without being too frustrating.\nI've had a tremendous time with this one, which, if memory serves me correct, is the first Ninja Gaiden game I’ve played. I can’t really find any notable faults with Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound. It’s well worth checking out. It’s out now on Steam, PS5, Xbox Series X/S and Nintendo Switch.\n\nHere’s another “hell yeah\" game. I’ve been looking forward to Time Flies ever since I clapped eyes on it during a Day of the Devs showcase a couple of years ago. You play as a fly and the goal is to check off a bucket list of items before the insect perishes (their lifespan equates to the average life expectancy of a country of your choosing but in seconds).\nIt’s a clever, funny and slightly rude — in a playful, Thank Goodness You’re Here sort of way — blend of exploration and puzzle game that makes a strong case as to why we should make the most of our limited time. It’s a short game, as it took me about 90 minutes to roll credits. That's pretty much the ideal length for this one.\nThe controls are simple (only a D-pad, pause button and a way to call up the bucket list are required) and the aesthetic, which features hand-drawn art, is delightfully low-key too. In fact, this would be a perfect fit for the Playdate, which just happens to come from Panic, the publisher of Time Flies. For now, though, you can check out this lovely little game from the team at Playables on Steam, PS5 and Nintendo Switch.\n\nWhatnot Games released the 1.0 version Star Racer on Steam this week after over a year of early access. This is a retro racer very much in the vein of the F-Zero series that features local multiplayer (here's hoping for online multiplayer at some point) and music from Grant Kirkhope of Banjo-Kazooie and GoldenEye 007 fame. You can also create your own tracks and share them with others online.\nI love the launch trailer for Star Racer, which blends gameplay with '80s-style animation. I also adore that — per Rock Paper Shotgun — one of the characters is a \"detective-looking fella called Thrash Whiplash.\" If that's not in the running for the best video game character name of the 2020s, we're all going to need to take a long, hard look in the mirror.\n\nWe have yet another flavor of pretty, retro-tinged pixel art this week thanks to developers Ancient Corporation and Bitwave Games, as well as publisher Limited Run Games. Their 16 bit-style shoot-'em-up Earthion landed on Steam this week.\nIt features music from legendary composer Yuzo Koshiro (Streets of Rage, ActRaiser, Shenmue and many more games). That probably should not come as a huge shock given that he co-founded Ancient. \nEarthion is also slated to hit consoles starting in September. Being a Limited Run title, physical editions are of course on the way for PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox Series X and Nintendo Switch. Expect those later this year. A physical version is also expected for Sega Genesis/Mega Drive in 2026.\n\nSurgent Studios went in a completely different direction for its follow-up to its well-received Metroidvania from last year, Tales of Kenzera: Zau. Its latest project (released with the help of the publishing arm of Palworld creator Pocketpair), Dead Take, is a first-person psychological horror about an actor who is looking for a friend who has vanished after a Hollywood party.\nThere's top-tier videogame acting talent here, with Neil Newbon (Astarion in Baldur's Gate 3) and Ben Starr (Clive Rosfield in Final Fantasy XVI) taking on the lead roles, and a litany of other well-known performers — from Laura Bailey to Sam Lake — also making appearances. That cast alone makes this worthy of attention. Dead Take is out now on Steam and the Epic Games Store.\n\nIt feels like we've been waiting forever for Hobbit life sim Tales of the Shire: A The Lord of the Rings Game to drop and, following some delays, it's now available on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch and Steam. (This is now technically an indie game because Take-Two sold off publisher Private Division last year.)\n\nI love games that tell you exactly what they're about in their title and A Game About Digging A Hole sure is one of those. You dig a hole, find buried goodies, and sell them to help you buy better gear. \nDeveloper DoubleBee and publishers Rokaplay and Headup brought this exploration game to iOS and Android this week after a hugely successful debut on Steam earlier this year. A Game About Digging A Hole has now sold more than 1 million copies.\n\nPerhaps you're looking for a different digging game to check out this weekend. In that case, Mashina may be worth considering. The titular character is a robot that searches for valuable minerals to help repair and expand her community. Mashina can also use the minerals to build machines that can help with her digs, while she can use items she stumbles upon for base decoration.\nDevelopers Jack King-Spooner and Talha Kaya (who previously released Judero) used traditional stop-motion techniques to animate Mashina. This charming-looking puzzle/exploration game is now available on Steam.\n\nLet's wrap up this section with a short, experimental game about anxiety. A Dream About Parking Lots has been out on Steam for a few months and the aptly named Interactive Dreams (with the help of Take It Studio!) brought it to PS5, Xbox Series X/S and Nintendo Switch this week. It's said to be based on real dreams and will see you looking for your car among parking lots and mazes while chatting with a therapist. \nUpcoming\n\nWander Stars — from Paper Castle Games and publisher Fellow Traveller — was supposed to be arriving this week, but the developers have pushed the release date back until September 19. The team wants to carry out some changes to improve the game following feedback from an open beta.\nI really like the look of this one, and though turn-based combat isn't usually my cup of tea, I'm very intrigued by the system that's in use here. You'll find and combine words into phrases that convert into devastating attacks. There are more than 200 words and they have cooldowns, so combining them in smart ways will be a key to success. Using words \"with honor\" can seemingly help you unlock more useful phrases too. Very curious to see how all of that works in practice. We'll get a better idea next month, when Wander Stars lands on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch and PC.\n\nSpeaking of games with a killer look, a gameplay trailer for I Hate This Place hooked me in this week. This is an isometric survival horror game that pulls from the visual stylings of its comic book origins. Crafting is vital here, both in terms of your arsenal and strengthening your shelter before nightfall. This stylish title from Rock Square Thunder and publisher Broken Mirror Games is bound for PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S and Nintendo Switch later this year.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/a-terrific-2d-ninja-gaiden-housefly-bucket-lists-and-other-new-indie-games-worth-checking-out-110005806.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "A jury in Florida has found Tesla partially liable for a 2019 crash involving the company's Autopilot self-driving feature, The Washington Post reports. As a result, the company will have to pay $43 million in compensatory damages and even more in punitive damages.\nAutopilot comes pre-installed on Tesla's cars and handles things like collision detection and emergency braking. Tesla has mostly avoided taking responsibility for crashes involving cars with the Autopilot enabled, but the Florida case played out differently. The jury ultimately decided that the self-driving tech enabled driver George McGee to take his eyes off the road and hit a couple, Naibel Benavides Leon and Dillon Angulo, ultimately killing one and severely injuring the other. \nDuring the case, Tesla's lawyers argued that McGee's decision to take his eyes off the road to reach for his phone was the cause of the crash, and that Autopilot shouldn't be considered. The plaintiffs, Angulo and Benevides Leon's family, argued that the way Tesla and Elon Musk talked about the feature ultimately created the illusion that Autopilot was safer than it really was. \"My concept was that it would assist me should I have a failure … or should I make a mistake,\" McGee said on the stand. \"And in that case I feel like it failed me.\" The jury ultimately assigned two-thirds of the responsibility to McGee and a third to Tesla, according to NBC News.\nWhen reached for comment, Tesla said it would appeal the decision and gave the following statement: \nToday’s verdict is wrong and only works to set back automotive safety and jeopardize Tesla’s and the entire industry’s efforts to develop and implement life-saving technology. We plan to appeal given the substantial errors of law and irregularities at trial. Even though this jury found that the driver was overwhelmingly responsible for this tragic accident in 2019, the evidence has always shown that this driver was solely at fault because he was speeding, with his foot on the accelerator – which overrode Autopilot – as he rummaged for his dropped phone without his eyes on the road. To be clear, no car in 2019, and none today, would have prevented this crash. This was never about Autopilot; it was a fiction concocted by plaintiffs’ lawyers blaming the car when the driver – from day one – admitted and accepted responsibility. \nIn a National Highway Traffic Safety Administration investigation of Autopilot from 2024, crashes were blamed on driver misuse of Tesla's system and not the system itself. The NHTSA also found that Autopilot was overly permissive and \"did not adequately ensure that drivers maintained their attention on the driving task,\" which lines up with the 2019 Florida crash.\nWhile Autopilot is only one component of Tesla's larger collection of self-driving driving features, selling the idea that the company's cars could safely driving on their own is a key part of its future. Elon Musk has claimed that Full Self-Driving (FSD), the paid upgrade to Autopilot, is \"safer than human driving.\" Tesla's Robotaxi service relies on FSD being able to function with no or minimal supervision, something that produced mixed results in the first few days the service was available. \nUpdate, August 1, 6:05PM ET: This story was updated after publication to include Tesla's statement.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/tesla-found-partially-liable-for-a-deadly-2019-crash-193612682.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Liquid Glass is a huge new change coming to iOS 26. (Apple)\nWaiting until the fall can feel like ages when you're ready to upgrade your iPhone to iOS 26. But there's good news: you can test out all the features now by downloading and installing Apple's public beta, which  CEO Tim Cook says is (with the other current beta operating systems) \"by far the most popular developer betas we’ve had,\" 9to5Mac reports. We also previewed the iOS 26 public beta release, which shows off the fresh home and lock screen redesign we've been asking to see for years. Called Liquid Glass, the new translucent look will extend across all of Apple's upcoming operating systems. The overhaul is one of several big changes coming to iOS, macOS, iPadOS and the rest of Apple's software suite, all of which were showcased during the company's WWDC keynote on June 9. \nAfter overpromising on AI plans last year, Apple kept its iOS roadmap focused more on basic quality of life improvements this year. There are multiple useful additions coming to the Phone and Messages apps on your iPhone, for instance: Apple execs outlined the ability to weed out spam texts or other unknown senders and an option to hold your spot on a phone call when you've been waiting for a representative to pick up. Plus, a treasured feature that we took for granted is coming back (hint: it's in the Photos app).\nSiri, meanwhile, is in a holding pattern. Apple has previously specified that its smarter voice assistant — first promised at WWDC 2024 — is delayed until some point \"in the coming year,\" so you shouldn't expect any major changes in the current betas. But there are reports that Apple is aiming to give Siri a bigger brain transplant by basing it on third-party artificial intelligence models like OpenAI's ChatGPT or Anthropic's Claude, which could make 2026 a pivotal year.\nWith each beta, it seems like additional new improvements are popping up, like a newly discovered FaceTime feature that'll freeze your video if it detects nudity. Most newer iPhone models are eligible to download iOS 26 (both the betas and final version). Want to see the full list of new features coming this fall? Read on.  \nWhat is iOS 26?\nThe current iPhone operating system is iOS 18, and Apple is still actively updating it — version 18.6 was just recently released. But don't expect to see iOS 19. Instead, Apple is skipping the numbering ahead to iOS 26 later this year. The company has decided to line up its iOS version numbers with a year-based system, similar to car model years. So while iOS and its sibling operating systems will be released in late 2025, they're all designated \"26\" to reflect the year ahead. (Meanwhile, iOS 18 is still getting new versions this summer, too.)\nIt's official, we're moving to iOS 26. (Apple)\nWhat is Liquid Glass design?\nLet's be honest. Out of everything announced at WWDC this year, the new Liquid Glass design was the star of the show. The iPhone's home and lock screens have looked pretty much the same year after year — the last exciting thing (in my opinion) was the option to add your own aesthetic to your home screen by customizing your apps and widgets. So seeing the home and lock screens' new facelift is refreshing.\nSo what exactly is Liquid Glass? Apple calls it a \"new translucent material\" since, well, the apps and widgets are clear. However, the screen can still adapt to dark and light modes, depending on surroundings. You'll also notice buttons with a new floating design in several apps, like Phone and Maps. They're designed to be less distracting than the current buttons, but are still easy to see. While the design overhaul has proven to be controversial since its announcement, some — including Engadget's own Devindra Hardawar — like the new direction, even if it's somewhat reminiscent of Microsoft's translucent Windows Vista Aero designs from nearly twenty years ago.\nThat said, as of the release of the iOS 26 beta 2, Apple has already incorporated some user feedback into the design, dialing back the transparency in at least some places. And while it will continue to evolve, Apple users won't be able to escape it: Liquid Glass was designed to make all of Apple's OSes more cohesive. Here's a look at how the translucent aesthetic will look with the new macOS Tahoe 26 on your desktop.\nWhat are the new and notable features of iOS 26?\niOS 26 has a laundry list of new features. Among the most worthwhile:\nPhone app redesign: You'll finally be able to scroll through contacts, recent calls and voicemail messages all on one screen. It also comes with a new feature called Hold Assist that'll notify you when an agent comes to the phone so you can avoid the elevator music and continue on with other tasks.\nLive Translation in Phone, FaceTime and Messages: iOS 26 is bringing the ability to have a conversation via phone call or text message with someone who speaks another language. Live Translation will translate your conversation in real time, which results in some stop-and-go interactions in the examples Apple shared during its presentation.\nPolls in group chats: Tired of sorting through what seems like hundreds of messages in your group chat? You and your friends will soon be able to create polls in group messages for deciding things like which brunch spot you're eating at or whose car you're taking on a road trip.\nFiltering unknown senders in Messages: If you haven't received spam texts about unpaid tolls or other citations, you're lucky. For those of us who have, those annoying messages will soon be filtered away in a separate folder.\nVisual Intelligence: Similar to a reverse Google image search, this new feature will allow you to search for anything that's on your iPhone screen. For instance, if you spot a pair of shoes someone is wearing in an Instagram photo, you can screenshot it and use Visual Intelligence to find those shoes (or similar ones) online.\nPhotos tabs are back: For anyone who's still frustrated with the Photos changes made last year, you'll be happy to know that your tabs are coming back. Library and Collections will have their own separate spaces so you don't have to scroll to infinity to find what you're looking for.\nFaceTime \"Communication Safety\" feature: A newer addition to iOS 26 appears to be the FaceTime \"Communication Safety\" feature that pauses communications if and when nudity is detected. The feature appears to be a child safety feature that uses on-device detection, thus obviating any cloud-based privacy issues. \nApple's Hold Assist will be nifty for those pesky services that put you on hold for 10 or more minutes. (Apple)\nWhich iPhones will be able to upgrade to iOS 26?\nA few iPhone models that run the current version of iOS — iPhone XR, XS and XS Max — won't be compatible with the latest upgrade. But any iPhones released in 2019 or later will be eligible for the iOS 26 update.\n\niPhone SE (second generation or later)\niPhone 11\niPhone 11 Pro\niPhone 11 Pro Max\niPhone 12\niPhone 12 mini\niPhone 12 Pro\niPhone 12 Pro Max\niPhone 13\niPhone 13 mini\niPhone 13 Pro\niPhone 13 Pro Max\niPhone 14\niPhone 14 Plus\niPhone 14 Pro\niPhone 14 Pro Max\niPhone 15\niPhone 15 Plus\niPhone 15 Pro\niPhone 15 Pro Max\niPhone 16e\niPhone 16\niPhone 16 Plus\niPhone 16 Pro\niPhone 16 Pro Max\n\nNot listed here are the presumed new iPhone 17 models (or maybe iPhone 26?) that are all but certain to be announced and released in September. \nHow to install iOS 26 beta\nThe iOS 26 public beta is now available to download via the Apple Beta Software Program. If you're not already a member, you'll need to sign up to try out all the latest features. Just visit beta.apple.com and sign up with your phone number or email address. It's free.\nOnce you're in, you can install it by going to Settings > General > Software Update and selecting iOS 26 public beta.\nA word of caution: Don't sign up with your main iPhone unless you're OK with any risks that occur with using an OS that isn't finalized.\nWhen will the final version of iOS 26 be released?\niOS 26 will be released to the public this fall. It usually comes in September, within a week of the Apple iPhone event. Last year, it rolled out to iPhone users on September 16 — exactly one week after the iPhone 16 lineup was announced.\nIf you're more interested in the Apple Intelligence features coming, here's everything Apple revealed for iOS, macOS and more during WWDC. Also, check out how iOS 26 screenshots could be an intriguing preview of Apple's delayed Siri rework.\nUpdate, August 1: Added quote from Tim Cook about iOS 26.\nUpdate, July 31: Noted that iOS 18.6 is now available. \nUpdate, July 24: Noted the iOS 26 public beta is now available.\nUpdate, July 3: Noted new FaceTime feature found in the developer beta.\nUpdate, June 30: Noted ongoing iOS 18 releases, and reports that Apple is considering additional external LLMs for Siri. \nUpdate, June 25: Noted changes added in iOS 26 beta 2. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/everything-you-need-to-know-about-ios-26-beta-release-how-to-download-it-on-your-iphone-new-apple-features-like-liquid-glass-and-more-135749961.html?src=rss",

While paid communities were meant to appeal to Reddit power users, the company still very much needs to grow its user base, according to Huffman. \"The folks previously working on user economy will join our efforts to improve the core app, including onboarding and personalization,\" the CEO explained in another AMA response. \"That gets at our most important need today, which is logged-in core user growth.\"\nWhile Huffman has spent the last year hinting at paid features, it's not hard to understand why Reddit would now be shifting away from that model. Advertising is still very much the most important part of the company's business, as Huffman explained. And adding more core users to the platform will be key to growing that business. To put this in perspective, during the last quarter, Reddit pulled in $465 million in ad revenue and just $35 million from \"other\" sources, like data licensing and Reddit premium. Even if paywalled subreddits could substantially increase that \"other\" number, it would still be a small fraction of what the company is making from advertisers.\nSo while paid subreddits may still be on the company's roadmap, users shouldn't expect to see them any time soon. They can, however, probably expect to see more ads in more places on Reddit over time. For example, Huffman said that the company sees \"ads on search return pages … as a future opportunity.\"This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/reddit-puts-its-plans-for-paid-subreddits-on-hold-181455933.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Nintendo sold 5.82 million Switch 2s in less than four weeks and is on pace to hit its target of 15 million units by April 2026, the company said in its latest earnings report. If that pans out, the Switch 2 would easily outsell the original Switch, which took a full year to hit that same 15 million sales number — making it a rare bright spot in today's gaming world.  \nDespite those superb sales figures, Nintendo says demand is outstripping supply in many regions and promises to boost production as soon as possible. There's some insight into Nintendo's available inventory elsewhere in the earnings report. The 5.82 million number counts sales up to June 30, and the company says that as of July 25, it had sold through \"more than 6 million\" consoles. That's not the clearest figure, but it definitely shows sales cratered in July despite consistent demand. \nSwitch 2 software sales were also strong with 8.67 million units sold, thanks in large part to the company's Switch 2 Mario Kart World bundle along with Donkey Kong Bananza and games from outside publishers (Nintendo also just announced a bunch of new third-party games coming soon). The company also sold 24.4 million games designed for the original Switch, largely because the new console is backwards compatible with previous Switch titles, it said. \nAll of that meant that Nintendo had a very good quarter, more than doubling revenue over last year to 572.3 billion yen ($3.8 billion) with a 56.9 billion yen profit ($378 million). The company still expects to bring in 1.9 trillion yen ($12.6 billion) for its fiscal year. \n \nUpdate, July 1, 12PM ET: This story has been updated after publish. The headline and article initially mistated the period in which Nintendo sold 5.82 million Switch 2 consoles as 7 weeks. That period relates to Nintendo's claim of \"more than 6 million\" sales, rather than the 5.82 million figure. The headline and article now accurately reflect the sales figures, and we regret the error.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/nintendo-has-sold-over-6-million-switch-2s-but-still-cant-keep-up-with-demand-120011674.html?src=rss",
    "full_text": "Engadget has been testing and reviewing consumer tech since 2004. Nintendo sold 5.82 million Switch 2s in less than four weeks and is on pace to hit its target of 15 million units by April 2026, the company said in its latest earnings report. If that pans out, the Switch 2 would easily outsell the original Switch, which took a full year to hit that same 15 million sales number — making it a rare bright spot in today's gaming world. Despite those superb sales figures, Nintendo says demand is outstripping supply in many regions and promises to boost production as soon as possible. The 5.82 million number counts sales up to June 30, and the company says that as of July 25, it had sold through \"more than 6 million\" consoles. That's not the clearest figure, but it definitely shows sales cratered in July despite consistent demand. Switch 2 software sales were also strong with 8.67 million units sold, thanks in large part to the company's Switch 2 Mario Kart World bundle along with Donkey Kong Bananza and games from outside publishers (Nintendo also just announced a bunch of new third-party games coming soon).

    "summary": "Nothing did things differently with its third generation of phones. First came the midrange Nothing Phone 3a (and 3a Pro), which combined stylish hardware with a competitive price. Now, the company has launched the Nothing Phone 3, which it's calling its first \"true flagship.\" At $799, it's Nothing's most expensive phone yet, featuring a bigger screen, four 50-megapixel cameras and a major redesign of the company’s signature Glyph interface, which has evolved into the more compact Glyph Matrix.\nNothing's hardware design is what truly sets its phones apart from the established players, and the 2025 model is more elaborate and complex than ever. At this price, however, it faces stiff competition from entry-level flagships like the Galaxy S25 and iPhone 16. Beyond the innovations and occasional gimmicks, has Nothing nailed the fundamentals enough to compete? \n\n\nHardware and design\n\n\n\n\n  Image by Mat Smith for Engadget\n \n\nOnce again, Nothing has made a phone that commands attention like no other. Everywhere I go, people are curious when they see me using the Phone 3, and the Glyph Matrix seems to both confuse and delight them.\nUnlike the protruding camera unit on the Nothing Phone 3a Pro, the Phone 3’s three cameras are separately lodged in the back and jut out a fraction of a millimeter. The see-through exterior returns, displaying screws and hardware modules organized into three vertical rows. This time, it’s more apparent that this is a design flourish rather than a genuine glimpse into the phone’s components. For example, a curious semi-circle of frosted glass beneath the flash doesn't seem to have a purpose (beyond an aesthetic one).\nElsewhere, a red square next to the ultrawide camera now acts as a recording light. It's another charming touch that can be disabled in the settings if you find it distracting. The off-center telephoto camera lens might also irk symmetry fans, but it's a choice that I don't particularly mind. The Phone 3 is 18 percent thinner than the Phone 2 and, without the camera bump of the 3a Pro, it looks and feels a step above its predecessors.\nThe main attraction is the Glyph Matrix: a circular dot-matrix display made of 489 LEDs that shows simple notifications, the time and battery level. While some loyal fans might miss the bold light show of previous models, this iteration is far more useful. Instead of a barrage of flashing lights, the Matrix can tell you who is calling through unique patterns and, with future updates, custom art assigned to your contacts.\nNothing continues to lean into its retro tech design inspiration, and I'll admit I'm a sucker for it. The dot-matrix text and numbers align perfectly with Nothing's Android skin, making the entire device feel cohesive. A capacitive haptic Glyph button beneath the Matrix lets you cycle through notifications and tools. Interactions are simple: a short press to switch modes or a long press to start tools like the stopwatch.\n\n\n\n\n  Image by Mat Smith for Engadget\n \n\nFortunately, you can use the Phone 3’s settings menu to assign Glyph Matrix tools and \"toys.\" Most of them are playful and frivolous, like Spin The Bottle and Magic 8 Ball, and Nothing is tapping into its community to create new Matrix widgets. Hopefully, functionality will expand as more users get involved. Some tools are less useful though, like a level that uses the phone’s accelerometer for a pixelated readout. It just seems a little imprecise; how much accuracy can you derive from less than 500 pixels? Others are quite slick, like a pixelated camera readout for framing selfies.\nWith Essential Notifications, you can assign specific app notifications or contacts to a unique pattern or a pixelated photo. However, it's challenging to create anything that doesn't look like a blurry mess. The same settings menu allows you to adjust the Matrix's brightness and how long the notifications persist.\nThe front of the Phone 3 is all display, with a 6.67-inch screen and a resolution of 2,800 x 1,260. If you prefer a large screen, this is probably its biggest advantage over the iPhone 16 and Galaxy S25. It’s also Nothing’s brightest phone yet, reaching up to 4,500 nits for HDR content — noticeably brighter than the Nothing Phone 3a. It supports HDR 10+ and a 120Hz refresh rate, all protected by Gorilla Glass 7.\nCameras\n\n\n\n\n  Image by Mat Smith for Engadget\n \n\nNothing has the fundamentals covered with the Phone 3’s cameras. The triple-camera system includes a 50-megapixel f/1.7 main sensor with optical image stabilization, a 50MP ultrawide and a new 50MP telephoto camera with 3x optical zoom.\nAs we noted in our Nothing Phone 3a review, telephoto cameras are rare on more affordable smartphones. On the Phone 3, there’s a periscope zoom, keeping the camera unit svelte and barely protruding from the device. It’s also impressive to see a 3x zoom paired with a high-resolution 50-megapixel sensor, which allows you to crop into images while retaining fidelity. Nothing even added a 6x zoom button in the camera app that crops the image further. The app also uses pixel-binning for more accurate color and better low-light pictures by default, which results in them being saved as 12-megapixel images.\nOverall, the camera system can be a little inconsistent. During a vacation in Amsterdam, the Phone 3 captured crisp images of wildlife and architecture. Its Action mode was particularly impressive, effortlessly adding motion blur to shots while keeping the subject sharp. However, at other times, what should have been vibrant cityscape shots and street art came out muted and grainy. For example, psychedelic cat artwork that was incredibly vibrant in person looked flat in the photos. The metadata revealed the phone had cranked up the ISO, a setting I haven't had to manually adjust on a smartphone in years.While some color variation between the three lenses is expected, images often looked as if they were taken on different phones, something that was especially evident in scenes with blue skies.\n\n\n\n\n  Image by Mat Smith for Engadget\n \n\nThe telephoto camera is the standout feature on the Phone 3. I love the ability to play with zoom, and the 3x optical zoom (plus the additional crop) makes this a more useful camera than those on the iPhone 16 or Pixel 9, which top out at 2x zoom. It’s also an excellent macro camera, using the zoom to prevent the phone from casting a shadow on the subject.\n\nSoftware\n\n\n\n\n  Image by Mat Smith for Engadget\n \n\nNothing once again outfits its phone with its own distinctive Android skin. The aesthetic is all monochrome, serif fonts and dot-matrix touches. I immediately chose this skin when setting up the phone for the first time, though finding some app icons can be more challenging without their original colors.\nEssential Space, with its dedicated hardware button, remains Nothing’s most interesting software addition. Since launching on the Nothing Phone 3a, it can now add events to your Google Calendar, remind you of tasks and summarize audio recordings. My biggest issue, however, is accidentally hitting the power button instead of the Essential Key, or vice versa. The keys need to be a different size or at least have a more distinct feel.\nPerformance and battery life\n\nWith a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8s Gen 4 processor, the Phone 3 performs solidly, but it’s not as snappy as a device with true flagship silicon, like the Snapdragon 8 Elite or Apple A18. Some might argue that the Phone 3 isn't a \"true flagship\" because its processor can be found in sub-$400 devices, but the chip is still powerful enough for most tasks and games, and can even deliver ray-traced graphics.\nNothing opted for a 5,150mAh silicon-carbon battery, making it one of the first phones we’ve tested with this new technology. It can store more lithium ions than traditional lithium-ion batteries, which Nothing claims adds a 10 percent boost in energy density compared to its predecessor. I didn’t feel any notable difference of the Phone 3 running cooler, however. In our battery rundown test, the Phone 3 was able to play a video file for just over 23 hours. That falls slightly shy of the Phone 2, but that has a smaller screen.\nThe Phone 3 also gets flagship-level charging speeds, supporting 65W wired charging that gets the device from empty to full in under an hour (with a compatible charger). It also supports 15W wireless charging and reverse wireless charging for earbuds. However, the lack of Qi2 support seems like an oversight for a \"true flagship.\"\n\nWrap-up\n\n\n\n\n  Image by Mat Smith for Engadget\n \n\nHow does Nothing’s flagship phone stack up against similarly priced smartphones? The Phone 3 offers a big 6.67-inch screen, a large battery with fast charging and 256GB of storage — double the amount found in the base Pixel 9 and Galaxy S25.\nHowever, a less-than-flagship chipset and inconsistent camera performance detract from the appeal of an otherwise intriguing phone with slick software and a unique design. The Glyph Matrix is much more useful than the flashing lights of the Phone 3’s predecessors, even if the design isn’t quite as bold. I just hope the company continues to evolve the tools available on it.\nThe Phone 3 is a much better phone than the two-year-old Nothing Phone 2, but it's also $200 more expensive, making any shortcomings more apparent. While I want Nothing to continue experimenting with its phones, it should probably prioritize shoring up the camera performance first.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/nothing-phone-3-review-143006151.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "In just under two months, assuming Apple sticks to its usual schedule, we'll finally put our eyes on the newest collections of smartphones: the iPhone 17 lineup. We already got a glimpse of what's coming with iOS 26 during the June WWDC event, but we're still in the dark about what the new iPhones will look like, as well as what new features they'll offer. However, there have been several leaks and rumors about the hardware side ahead of the phones' official introduction. Here's what we're expecting and what we can reasonably assume we'll get from Cupertino in September.\nWhat are the latest iPhone 17 rumors and reports?\nNot all iPhone rumors are created equal, and all should be taken with a grain of salt. As July turns to August, we've gotten \"leaked\" colors and a glimpse of a purported iPhone 17 \"spotted in the wild.\" Let's get into it below.\nI just spotted a test development iPhone in the wild 🤩🤩🤩 pic.twitter.com/iS3PtKWqxJ— Fox Pupy 🦊🧡 (@Skyfops) July 28, 2025\n\nThe pics, highlighted on MacRumors, show a black cased iPhone (17?) with the sort of extended top rear \"camera island\" rumored to be coming to the new Pro iPhones. Is it the real deal? The dual angles lend a degree of credibility in a social media landscape increasingly polluted with AI-enhanced fakes, but your guess is as good as ours.  \nBut that's not the only rumor. A \"tipster\" contacted MacRumors to allege three new iPhone Pro camera features: an upgraded telephoto lens with up to 8x optical zoom (up from the current 5x); an all-new pro camera app from Apple for photos and videos; and an additional Camera Control button on the top edge of the phone. That last one seems especially unbelievable, as it would be the third new button added to new iPhones in as many years. Do we really need two dedicated camera keys, in addition to the Action Button? \nMeanwhile, on July 30, Tom's Guide highlighted an X post from Sonny Dickson — a longtime and generally reliable leaker of unreleased iPhone information — showing \"dummy\" iPhone 17 models in the new colors he had leaked earlier in the month (see below). While these are literally just mock-ups — not real, leaked iPhones — it's interesting to see how the design and color rumors translate into a real-world look and feel. Of course, we won't know if these colors are legit until the iPhone event this fall.\nFirst look at iPhone 17 color dummies, The new orange really stands out this year — definitely a bold addition. Thoughts? pic.twitter.com/M0gB6NSglI— Sonny Dickson (@SonnyDickson) July 29, 2025\n\nWhen will the iPhone 17 series be announced?\nMost years, the flagship smartphones are introduced in September. It's a little early to have the specific dates; some years, Apple only gives a week or two of lead time between sending invites and hosting the event. But years of past precedent show that sometime in September should be when the 17 models make their debut. This family of smartphones may be the last to follow that trend, however. There have been hints that the introduction of the iPhone 18 collection in 2026 will be split into a pro-tier announcement in the fall and a standard model announcement the following spring.\nWhat will the new iPhone 17 lineup include?\nDesign leaks suggest that Apple is building an ultra-thin smartphone, likely to be named the iPhone 17 Air to match Apple's ultralight laptop designation. Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, often a solid source of advanced intel about Apple, reported in January that the iPhone 17 Air will be equipped with a basic A19 chip and will only have a single camera lens. It may also use Apple's new in-house modem, which was introduced in February on the iPhone 16e. More details about this development may leak ahead of September, but that's what we know for now.\nAn investor note from Apple analyst Jeff Pu indicated that the Air will have a titanium frame. If his reports are accurate, the lightweight smartphone will be the only entry in the iPhone 17 lineup to use that metal; the iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone 17 Pro Max are expected to be made of aluminum, which is oddly a lighter material than titanium. Other speculation had suggested that the Air would use a blend of aluminum and titanium, so the exact materials may not be known until the official announcement.\nEach new roster includes a base model, but over the years, Apple shakes up the variety of phones it offers. Most likely there will be an iPhone 17 and an iPhone 17 Pro. Apple has also committed to the size matters philosophy, and has been building an iPhone Pro Max option with an even bigger screen and better battery life; the 17 roster will almost certainly have one as well. \nThe iPhone 17 Air seems primed to take the place of a potential iPhone 17 Plus. Since the iPhone 16e was only just introduced in February at a surprisingly high price point, it seems unlikely that there will be a new addition to that lower end of the spectrum, the models that were previously called SE. \nAt the very least, it sounds like the iPhone 17 Air won't take away the charging port and rely only on wireless connectivity. Bloomberg said that while Apple had investigated making the iPhone 17 Air without a single port, the company (fortunately) changed plans. He also says that the rumored phone will have a 6.6-inch screen and include the Dynamic Island and Camera Control button. Finally, the price is rumored at $900 — likely more than the standard iPhone 17 but less than the Pro.\nWe've also gotten what seems to be a reliable look at what the color lineup will be for the new smartphones. Macworld reported that the iPhone 17 will be available in black, white, steel gray, green, purple and light blue. The iPhone 17 Air will reportedly have four color options: black, white, light blue and light gold. While the Air colors will be less saturated, the visuals for the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max will go bold. The options for the Pro models are expected to be black, white, gray, dark blue and orange.\nWhat will iOS 26 be like?\nApple upended its numbering conventions with WWDC 2025, and will match the name of each new operating system to the year it's released. So when the next wave of iPhones hits, they'll be running on iOS 26.\nOn the design side, the smartphone OS introduced during the big developer showcase took a contentious approach dubbed Liquid Glass. Apple has been scaling down the amount of transparency effects in the subsequent beta tests of iOS 26, but it will still have a glass-like visual.\nThe feature list includes big and small updates. On the more impactful side, the Phone and Photos apps have been redesigned. There will be several features leveraging artificial intelligence, such as live translation capabilities coming to Phone, FaceTime and Messages. Apple is also currently testing a sensitive content warning for child accounts that will freeze FaceTime video if nudity is detected by on-device machine learning tools. And the company is also launching Visual Intelligence, which will use AI to search for elements in an image.\niOS 26 also has a litany of minor, quality of life improvements. Group texts are getting support for polls. And for the slow risers out there, iOS 26 will finally let you escape the tyranny of the nine minute snooze alarm. \nThe next iOS is now available as a public beta. Here are our initial impressions of the Liquid Glass design and other new features. iOS 26 is compatible with all models back through iPhone 11.\nUpdate, August 1, 2025, 8:15AM ET: Added new photos showing potential iPhone 17 colors.\nUpdate, July 30, 2025, 11:08AM ET: Added latest leaks and rumors about the iPhone 17, and updated information on the iOS 26 public beta.\nUpdate, July 17, 2025, 4:40PM ET: Added latest information about iOS 26, possible materials for the Air, and the color options for the different models.\nUpdate, March 17, 2025, 2PM ET: Added details about the rumored price and features of the iPhone 17 Air.\nUpdate, April 11, 2025, 3:45PM ET: Added details from Front Page Tech's new video that claims to reveal details from a leaked iOS 19 build.\nKatie Teague contributed to this story.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/iphone-17-pro-max-and-air-everything-we-know-about-apples-new-phones-153024282.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "We still think getting a live TV streaming service is a better deal than paying for cable — but the gulf between the two options is narrowing. Now that many of the major providers go for more than $80 per month, it’s not the amazing deal it once was. Still, live TV streaming plans have no contract, offer relatively simpler pricing and need no special equipment beyond a smart TV and an internet connection.After testing all the major players, we found YouTube TV to be the most well-rounded. But other services have their advantages, too, and there are plenty of free services as well. Here are the best live TV streaming services we tested, along with our advice on how to stream and what to look for.Editor’s note: We are still waiting to see launch date and pricing details for ESPN’s upcoming standalone streaming service. In the meantime, we’ve learned that customers paying for any DirecTV Signature Package or the MySports Genre Pack will gain access to the Unlimited version of ESPN's service at no extra charge once it’s live. DirecTV customers with a Gemini device will also get access to the Disney+ and Hulu basic bundle. The announcement stems from a distribution agreement DirecTV reached with Disney (owner of ESPN) last September. \nTable of contents\n\nBest live TV streaming services for 2025\nBest free live TV streaming services for 2025\nWhat to look for in a live TV streaming service\nHow we tested\nLive TV Streaming FAQs\nRecent updates\n\nBest live TV streaming services for 2025\n \n \n \n \n \n \nBack to top \nBest free live TV streaming services for 2025\nThere are plenty of ways to get free TV these days. To start, many standard streaming apps have added live components to their lineups. You’re paying for the service, so it’s not technically “free,” but you can get a dose of live TV without spending more than necessary. Peacock includes some regional NBC stations, and notably access to the 2024 Summer Olympic Games. Paramount+ subscribers can watch on-air CBS programming. The standard Hulu app has a live ABC news channel and Max now includes a live CNN outlet with its service, along with cable-like linear channels.\nThe smart TV operating system (OS) you use likely provides free live content too: Amazon’s Fire TV interface has a live tab and Roku’s built-in Roku Channel includes hundreds of live channels at no extra cost. The same goes for Samsung TV Plus, which added a trove of K-dramas to its free live and on-demand lineup in 2024. The PBS app offers local live streams of its channels — even NASA has a free streaming service with live coverage. \nBut for a full suite of live TV networks, and don’t want to sign up for any paid service, there are a number of free ad-supported TV services that have live TV. Even cable company DirecTV has joined the crowd with MyFree, and Fubo Free lets customers with a lapsed subscription keep watching some content. Here's the best of the live TV streaming services we tried:\n \n \n \n \n \nBack to top\nWhat to look for in a live TV streaming service\nHow to stream live TV\nStreaming live TV is a lot like using Netflix. You get access through apps on your phone, tablet, smart TV or streaming device and the signal arrives over the internet. A faster and more stable connection tends to give you a better experience. Most live TV apps require you to sign up and pay via a web browser. After that, you can activate the app on all of your devices.\nMonthly Price\nWhen I started testing these cord-cutting alternatives, I was struck by the price difference between live TV and a standard video streaming app. Where the latter cost between $5 and $20 per month, most live TV services hit the $80 mark and can go higher than $200 with additional perks, channel packages and premium extras. The higher starting price is mostly due to the cost of providing multiple networks — particularly sports and local stations. And, in the past year or so, every service except Sling has raised base plan prices.\nLocal channels\nOnly two of the services I tried don’t include full local channel coverage for subscribers and one of those makes no effort to carry sports at all. That would be Philo and, as you might guess, it’s the cheapest. The next most affordable option, Sling, only carries three local stations — and only in larger markets — but it still manages to include some of the top sports channels.\nWhen you sign up with any provider that handles local TV, you’ll enter your zip code, ensuring you get your area’s broadcast affiliates for ABC, CBS, FOX and NBC. Of course, you can also get those stations for free. Nearly all modern television sets support a radio frequency (RF) connection, also known as the coaxial port, which means if you buy an HD antenna, you’ll receive locally broadcast stations like ABC, CBS, PBS, FOX and NBC. And since the signal is digital, reception is much improved over the staticky rabbit-ears era.\nBut local channel access is another area where traditional streaming services, like Netflix, are bleeding into broadcast territory. For example, you can watch your local NBC station with a Peacock subscription and you can tune into your area’s CBS station through your Paramount+ subscription. Netflix is even getting into the mix with a recently announced deal with one of France’s broadcast companies, TF1. The streaming service will now air TF1's live TV channels and on-demand content inside the Netflix app. No word if the concept will expand to other regions, but it’s an interesting move to anyone interested in the future of streaming.\nLive sports coverage\nOne reality that spun my head was the sheer number and iterations of sports networks in existence. Trying to figure out which network will carry the match-up you want to see can be tricky. I found that Google makes it a little easier for sports fans by listing out upcoming games (just swap in NBA, NFL, MLB, NHL and so on in the search bar). When you click an event, the “TV & streaming” button will tell you which network is covering it.\nThat just leaves figuring out if your chosen service carries the RSNs (regional sports networks) you want. Unfortunately, even with add-ons and extra packages, some providers simply don’t have certain channels in their lineups. It would take a lawyer to understand the ins and outs of streaming rights negotiations, and networks leave and return to live TV carriers all the time. That said, most major sporting events in the US are covered by ESPN, Fox Sports, TNT, USA and local affiliates.\nI should also point out that traditional streaming services have started adding live sports to their lineups. Peacock carries live Premier League matches, Sunday Night Football games and aired the 2024 Olympic Games from Paris. Thursday Night Football as well as NBA and WNBA games are on Amazon Prime and Christmas Day Football aired on Netflix. Max (formerly HBO Max) now airs select, regular season games from the NHL, MLB, NCAA and NBA with a $10-per-month add-on. You can watch MLS games with an add-on through the Apple TV app, and Apple TV+ includes some MLB games. Roku users can watch the just-added free sports channel and those who subscribe to Paramount Plus can see many of the matches aired on CBS Sports, including live NFL games. This year, even the Super Bowl was live-streamed for free on Tubi. While all of these alternatives may not cover as much ground as live TV streamers, they could end up being cheaper avenues to the sports you want.\nAnd if sports is all you’re after, there are sports-only plans that are a touch cheaper, too. The promised sports streaming service from ESPN, Fox and Warner Bros. called Venu was cancelled early this year. But in May, ESPN confirmed it will launch its own streaming service that will include all ESPN channels, though a start date hasn’t been confirmed. DirecTV recently  announced a $70-per-month, sports-only streaming package called MySports and Comcast now has a sports and news bundle for the same price (as long as you're an Xfinity customer with auto-pay, otherwise it's more expensive).\nTraditional cable networks\nDozens of linear programming networks were once only available with cable TV, like Bravo, BET, Food Network, HGTV, CNN, Lifetime, SYFY and MTV. If you only subscribe to, say, Netflix or Apple TV+, you won’t have access to those. But as with sports, standard streamers are starting to incorporate this content into their offerings. After the Warner Bros. merger, Max incorporated some content from HGTV, Discovery and TLC. Peacock has Bravo and Hallmark shows, and Paramount+ has material from Nickelodeon, MTV and Comedy Central.\nOther channels like AMC+ have stand-alone apps. The Discovery+ app gives you 15 channels ad-free for $9 per month (or with ads for $5 monthly). And a service called Frndly TV starts at a mere $7 per month and streams A&E, Lifetime, Game Show Network, Outdoor Channel and about 35 others. Of course, most live TV streaming options will deliver more sizable lists of cable networks, but just note that you may already be paying for some of them — and if all you need is a certain channel, you could get it cheaper by subscribing directly.\nOn-demand streaming\nMost live TV subscriptions include access to a selection of video-on-demand (VOD) content, like you would get with a traditional streaming service. Much of this content is made up of the movies and TV series that have recently aired on your subscribed networks. This typically doesn’t cover live events and news programming, but I was able to watch specific episodes of ongoing shows like Top Chef or BET’s Diarra from Detroit. Just search the on-demand library for the program, pick an episode and hit play.\nPartnerships, like Hulu’s relationship with Disney, and add-ons, such as bundling Max with your YouTube TV subscription or Starz with your Sling plan, will let you watch even larger libraries of on-demand content. But again, if VOD is all you’re after, paying for those networks directly instead of through a live TV plan will be far cheaper.\nDigital video recordings (DVR) limits\nEvery option I tried offers some cloud DVR storage without needing a separate physical device. You’ll either get unlimited storage for recordings that expires after nine months or a year, or you’ll get a set number of hours (between 50 and 1,000) that you can keep indefinitely. Typically, all you need to do is designate what ongoing TV series you want to record and the DVR component will do all the hard work of saving subsequent episodes for you to watch later. You can do the same thing with sports events.\nAside from being able to watch whenever it’s most convenient, you can also fast-forward through commercials in recorded content. In contrast, you can’t skip them on live TV or VOD.\nSimultaneous streams and profiles per account\nEach plan gives you a certain number of simultaneous streams, aka how many screens can play content at the same time. And while most providers will let you travel with your subscription, there are usually location restrictions that require you to sign in from your home IP address periodically. Stream allowances range from one at a time to unlimited screens (or as many as your ISP’s bandwidth can handle). Some plans require add-ons to get more screens.\nMost services also let you set up a few profiles so I was able to give different people in my family the ability to build their own watch histories and libraries, set their favorite channels and get individual recommendations.\nPicture-in-picture mode and multiview\nPicture-in-picture (PiP) usually refers to shrinking a video window on a mobile device or computer browser so you can watch it while using other apps. Sling, YouTube TV, FuboTV, Philo, DirecTV Stream and Hulu + Live TV all have PiP modes on computers and mobile devices. Another feature, multiview, lets you view multiple live sports games at once on your TV screen. YouTube TV and FuboTV are the only live TV streamers that let you do this. With YouTube TV, you can select up to four views from a few preset selection of streams. FuboTV offers the same feature, but only if you're using an Apple TV or Roku streaming device.\n4K live streams\nRight now, just FuboTV, YouTube TV and DirecTV Stream offer 4K live streams — but with caveats. YouTube TV requires a $20-per-month add-on, after which you’ll only be able to watch certain live content in 4K. DirecTV Stream has three channels that show live 4K content — one with shows and original series, and two with occasional sporting events. You don’t have to pay extra for these but you do need to have either DirecTV’s Gemini receiver, or a device from Fire TV, Apple TV or Roku. You’ll need those same streaming devices to watch the select 4K programming on Sling as well. FuboTV shows certain live events in 4K but access is limited to the Elite and Premier packages, not the base-level Pro plan.\nOf course, watching any 4K content also requires equipment that can handle it: a 4K smart TV or 4K streaming device paired with a cord and screen that can handle 4K resolution.\nTiers, packages and add-ons\nComparing price-to-offering ratios is a task for a spreadsheet. I… made three. The base plans range from $28 to $85 per month. From there, you can add packages, which are usually groups of live TV channels bundled by themes like news, sports, entertainment or international content. Premium VOD extras like Max, AMC+ and Starz are also available. Add-ons cost an extra $5 to $20 each per month and simply show up in the guide where you find the rest of your live TV. This is where streaming can quickly get expensive, pushing an $80 subscription to $200 monthly, depending on what you choose.\nHow to stream live TV for free\nI also downloaded and tried out a few apps that offer free ad-supported TV (FAST) including Freevee, Tubi, PlutoTV and Sling Freestream. These let you drop in and watch a more limited selection of live networks at zero cost. Most don’t even require an email address, let alone a credit card. And if you have a Roku device, an Amazon Fire TV or Stick, a Samsung TV, a Chromecast device or a Google TV, you already have access to hundreds of live channels via the Roku Channel, the live tab in Fire TV, through the Samsung TV Plus app or through Google TV.\nBack to top\nHow we tested\nWhen I begin testing for a guide, I research the most popular and well-reviewed players in the category and narrow down which are worth trying. For the paid plans, just six services dominate so I tried them all. There are considerably more free live TV contenders so I tested the four most popular. After getting accounts set up using my laptop, I downloaded the apps on a Samsung smart TV running the latest version of Tizen OS. I counted the local stations and regional sports coverage, and noted how many of the top cable networks were available. I then weighed the prices, base packages and available add-ons.\nI then looked at how the programming was organized in each app’s UI and judged how easy everything was to navigate, from the top navigation to the settings. To test the search function, I searched for the same few TV shows on BET, Food Network, HGTV and Comedy Central, since all six providers carry those channels. I noted how helpful the searches were and how quickly they got me to season 6, episode 13 of Home Town.\nI used DVR to record entire series and single movies and watched VOD shows, making sure to test the pause and scan functions. On each service with sports, I searched for the same four upcoming NHL, NBA, MLS and NCAA basketball matches and used the record option to save the games and play them back a day or two later. Finally, I noted any extra perks or irritating quirks.\nAll live TV streaming services we’ve tested:\n\nPhilo\nSling\nYouTube TV\nHulu + Live TV\nDirecTV Stream\nFuboTV\nFreevee\nTubi\nPlutoTV\nSling Freestream\nPlex\n\nBack to top\nLive TV Streaming FAQs\nWhat is live streaming?\nStreaming simply refers to video content that is delivered to your screen over the internet. Live streaming can be split into two categories: linear programming and simultaneous transmission. That first one is similar to what you get with cable or broadcast TV, with channels that play a constant flow of movies and shows (sort of what TV looked like before Netflix). Simultaneous streaming lets you watch live events (like a basketball game) or a program (like the evening news) as they happen.\nWhat is the difference between streaming and live streaming?\nStandard streaming, the most popular example being Netflix, lets you pick what you want to watch from a menu of choices. It’s also referred to as “video on demand.” Live streaming refers to sports and news events that you can stream as they happen in real time. It also refers to channels that show a continuous, linear flow of programming.\nWhat streaming service is best for live TV?\nFuboTV does the best job of letting you organize live channels to help you find just what you want to watch. The interface is uncluttered and when you search for something, the UI clearly tells you whether something is live now or on-demand. YouTube TV also does a good job making that info clear. Both have just over 100 live channels on offer.\nWhat is the most cost effective TV streaming service?\nFree TV streaming services like PlutoTV, Plex, Tubi and FreeVee show plenty of ad-supported TV shows and movies without charging you anything. Of course, they won’t have the same channels or content that more premium subscriptions have. Ultimately it depends on what you want to watch and finding the service that can supply that to you in the most streamlined form so you’re not paying for stuff you don’t need.\nIs it cheaper to have cable or streaming?\nA basic cable package used to be more expensive than the base-level live TV streaming service. But now that nearly all major providers have raised their prices to over $75 per month, that’s no longer the case. And with add-ons and other premiums, you can easily pay over $200 a month for either cable or a live TV streaming service.\nWhat streaming service has all the TV channels?\nNo service that we tested had every available channel. Hulu + Live TV and DirecTV Stream carry the the highest number of the top rated channels, according to Neilsen. Hulu’s service also gets you Disney+ fare, which you can’t get elsewhere. FuboTV has the most sports channels and YouTube TV gives you the widest selection of add-ons.\nWhat is the most popular live TV streaming platform?\nYouTube TV has the most paying customers. According to 2024's letter from the CEO, the service has over eight million subscribers. Disney’s 2024 third quarter earnings put the Hulu + Live TV viewer count at 4.6 million. Sling’s customer count dipped from two million to about 1.9 million in 2024 and FuboTV grew its subscriber list to 1.6 million.\nHow safe are free streaming services and websites?\nYou may have heard certain sites that provide free content can be dangerous, leading to stolen info and/or exposing you to malware. That’s likely in reference to certain peer-to-peer (P2P) networks and file-sharing sites that let people download free movies and series — which can come bundled with malicious code.\nBut if you’re talking about the free ad-supported streaming television (FAST) services listed here, from providers like PlutoTV, Tubi and Freevee, they are just as safe as any other streaming service. Since you sometimes don’t even have to provide your email address or credit card info, they can even be more anonymous than apps that require login credentials.\nBack to top\nRecent updates\nJanuary 31, 2025: Added information about which streaming service would live-stream the Super Bowl, including Tubi’s free option. Updated Fubo’s pricing. Added details about DirectTV Stream’s sports-only package and Comcast’s sports and news bundle.\nJanuary 16, 2025: Included higher prices for Sling’s Orange and Blue plans. Noted the demise of the never-launched Venu sports streaming service and mentioned the inclusion of DirecTV’s new sports package.\nDecember 31, 2024: Noted increased pricing for YouTube TV, Hulu+ Live TV and DirecTV. Updated information for 4K streaming capabilities and requirements for multiple services. Reported on the upcoming shut down of Amazon’s Freevee service and the addition of DirecTV’s free service.\nAugust 6, 2024: Updated with the addition of Plex as a free live TV streaming recommendation and mentioned the additional free channels Philo is now including with the free version of its service. Added pricing information for ESPN's new sports-only streaming service, Venu. \nJune 12, 2024: Updated with more information about 4K live streaming, picture-in-picture and multiview modes, as well as video on-demand options. We expanded our recommendations around free live TV streaming services and added a FAQ query about the safety of free streaming services and clarified the difference between standard and live streaming. More traditional streaming services have added live and sports components, so we revised that section accordingly.\nBack to topThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/best-live-tv-streaming-service-133000410.html?src=rss",
    "full_text": "It’s similar to other free ad supported TV streamers, with a limited channel selection through the same Fubo interface. It’s still the service that most closely resembles cable, complete with numbered channels and somewhat confusing plan structures. There’s still no way to stop whatever is playing as you browse the guide — something I find irritating, but it might not bother everyone. The same goes for Samsung TV Plus, which added a trove of K-dramas to its free live and on-demand lineup in 2024. The FAST service has around 800 live TV channels that are organized fairly granularly and you can have up to 15 profiles. There was once a nifty integration with notable music streaming service Tidal, but that collaboration sadly came to an end late in 2024. People who don’t pay for Prime will still be able to access some of the free content through that app. Aside from being able to watch whenever it’s most convenient, you can also fast-forward through commercials in recorded content. Each plan gives you a certain number of simultaneous streams, aka how many screens can play content at the same time. YouTube TV requires a $20-per-month add-on, after which you’ll only be able to watch certain live content in 4K."

    "summary": "Google is updating AI Mode on desktop this week with the ability to process images, so you can ask it detailed questions about the pictures like you already can on mobile. In the coming weeks, the company is also adding support for PDF uploads on desktop, which could help you digest lengthy course or work materials. You can ask AI Mode to summarize the documents for you and ask follow-up questions that it will then answer by cross-referencing the materials you uploaded with information available on the web. Google says AI Mode's responses will also include links to its references that you can visit in order to dig deeper. AI Mode will support additional file types for upload, including ones straight from your Google Drive, in the coming months as well. \nIn addition to PDF upload support, Google is also rolling out a new Canvas feature that you can access if you're enrolled in the AI Mode Labs experiment in the US. You can use Canvas to consolidate all relevant information about a specific topic or for a specific purpose in a side panel that updates as you ask AI Mode more follow-up questions. If you're traveling, for instance, you can ask AI Mode to make you an itinerary and click the Create Canvas button. You'll be able to keep refining the itinerary with more questions, and you can always leave it alone for a while and come back to it later. \nAI Mode's Search Live is also getting video input on mobile this week, a feature Google announced at I/O 2025, after voice input arrived in June. To be able to access video input, you'll have to open Lens in the Google app and tap the Live icon before asking questions on what the camera sees. When Google revealed the feature during its annual developers' event, it said you could point the camera at a math problem, for example, and ask Search to help you solve it or to explain a concept you're having trouble understanding. \nFinally, with Lens in Chrome, you'll be able to ask AI Mode what's on your desktop screen. The company will roll out an \"Ask Google about this page\" dropdown option in the address bar \"soon.\" When you click on it, AI Mode will create an overview with key information on what's being shown on your screen on the side panel, whether it's a web page or a PDF. That side panel will also contain a new \"Dive Deeper\" button that gives you a way to ask AI Mode specific questions about you've selected on your screen with Lens on desktop. \nUpdated August 1, 2025 5:45AM ET: This story has been updated to add information on \"Dive Deeper.\"\nUpdate, July 29 2025, 12:29PM ET: This story has been updated, as Google shared after the article was published that the image and PDF upload features will be available wherever AI Mode is available, not just in the US. That means those uploads will come to the US, India and the UK.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/google-is-bringing-image-and-pdf-uploads-to-ai-mode-160050646.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Your new iPad is sleek, powerful and ready to tackle everything from binge-watching to serious productivity — but without the right protection, it’s also one drop away from disaster. One of the most important iPad accessories is a solid case. Whether you want something rugged to handle everyday wear and tear, a slim case that keeps things lightweight or a keyboard cover to turn your tablet into a mini laptop, there are plenty of options to suit your needs.Some cases go beyond basic protection, offering adjustable stands for better viewing angles, built-in storage for your Apple Pencil or even added durability for clumsy moments. We’ve rounded up the best iPad accessories to keep your new iPad safe and functional.\nBest iPad cases for 2025\n \n \n \n \n \nWhy do I need an iPad case?\nIt’s almost always a good idea to keep your iPad in a case so it’s protected against hazards and accidents. The best iPads are expensive — even the most affordable model will set you back at least $300 — so you’ll want to safeguard your gear as much as possible. \niPad case FAQs\nWhat is the difference between an iPad case and an iPad cover?\nAll iPad covers are cases, but not all iPad cases are covers — yes, it’s a bit confusing, but allow us to explain. Most iPad covers are cases that surround the back of your tablet and have a flap that covers the screen, so it provides protection for the body as well as its display. Plenty of iPad cases also have screen covers, but you don’t have to get one with that feature. Instead, you could just get a case that hugs the back of the tablet and nothing else. Those accessories will be marginally thinner and lighter than their cover-toting counterparts, and give your iPad a more svelte profile.\nHow often should I charge my iPad?\nHow often you charge your iPad will depend on how often you use it. Most iPads will last at least a regular work day with frequent usage, which is one of the reasons why many have opted to use their iPads as laptop replacements. But with heavy usage, like constant video streaming or gaming, will come more rapid battery drain. A good rule of thumb is to charge your iPad when you go to sleep each night, that way you’ll have a topped-up device waiting for you in the morning.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-ipad-cases-to-protect-your-tablet-130033533.html?src=rss",

OtterBox Best iPad case with extra protection OtterBox Defender Series Case Features: Auto sleep/wake, magnetic closure, 4-way stand | Form: Hard shell | Connectivity: N/A If you’re not messing around with your iPad, look no further than Otterbox’s Defender series of cases. In addition to passing more than 24 shock, abrasion and drop tests, Defender cases have a built-in screen protector and covers for the single port on all of the latest iPad models for extra durability. You can also detach the Shield Stand and use it to prop up your iPad for better viewing. It feels surprisingly sturdy, and the keyboard itself is great to use for long periods of time. While it does offer one of the best typing experiences you can get with the selection of iPad Pro cases and other models, there are two major drawbacks to the Magic Keyboard: it doesn’t provide a ton of drop protection, and it’s expensive. Without a doubt, it’s the most luxurious iPad case on this list, but those who want to make their iPad as functional as possible will get a lot of use out of it. The backlit keyboard is pretty spacious and includes a multi-touch trackpad for more precise on-screen control. There’s also a spot for your Apple Pencil, so it’ll be close at hand when you need to mark up a document, navigate apps or doodle an idea in Apple Notes. The best iPads are expensive — even the most affordable model will set you back at least $300 — so you’ll want to safeguard your gear as much as possible."

    "summary": "Whether you’re a true cord-cutter or you just want to watch the next season of Stranger Things when it drops, everyone’s on the lookout for streaming deals nowadays. Plenty have chosen VOD and live TV streaming services over traditional cable in recent years, but the savings that choice got you just a few years ago have somewhat evaporated now. Companies like Netflix, Disney, Max and others have been consistently raising prices to the point where you may question if streaming is even worth it anymore.\nWe at Engadget still think so, for many reasons, but you can (and should) be smart with your money at the same time. Streaming deals are an option, even if they don’t come around with the same regularity as discounts on AirPods do. If you’re looking to save money and still stream all of the content you want, Engadget can help by laying out the best streaming deals you can get right now, how you can save with bundles and everything you should know before paying for yet another streaming service. \nBest streaming deals\nTrue streaming deals can be hard to come by. Most often, they’ll pop up during the Black Friday shopping period. On occasion, we’ll see them sparingly throughout the year and they usually take the form of a discounted monthly or annual rate for a limited period of time. Also, true streaming deals are typically on the ad-supported versions of a service, but once in a while you’ll find a unicorn of a deal on a tier that has ad-free viewing.\nIf you’re able to wait for a deal before subscribing to a streaming service, we recommend doing so. You’ll save money upfront and in the long run, and you also have the option to cancel your subscription before the price goes back up to the normal rate. Maybe you find you like the service so much that you’re fine paying full price for it — that’s the ideal situation. But if you’re not compelled to keep that app on rotation in your smart TV, most streaming services make it easy for you to cancel at any time. With that said, these are the best streaming deals you can snag right now.\n \nYouTube TV (two months) for $120 ($46 off): You can get two months of our favorite live TV streaming service for $60 per month which works out to $46 less than paying the full $83 each month. And right now, the service is free for the first 21 days. That should give you a decent chunk of time to see if the service is right for you. The discount and trial are only open to new subscribers to YouTube TV’s base plan, which includes access to over 100 channels, unlimited DVR space and six household accounts with the ability to stream on three devices at once. \nSling Orange for $23/month for the first month (50 percent off): New customers can get Sling Orange or Sling Blue for half off the usual price for the first month, bringing the final prices to $23/month and $25.50/month, respectively. Orange is likely best for sports fans, with eight exclusive sports and family channels, while Blue includes 19 exclusive news and entertainment channels. You can get both Orange and Blue access also for half off for one month, or $33 total.\nFubo Pro for $65/month for the first month ($20 off): Fubo has introductory discounts on most of its packages, and the Pro package is the least expensive plan currently listed. It offers access to 224 channels, unlimited cloud DVR and up to 10 simultaneous streams. It even includes regional sports content from the NHL, MLB and NBA.\nSpotify Premium Individual (1 month) for $0 ($12 off): This is our favorite music streaming service for podcasts and social features. Right now, users who have not signed up for Spotify's Premium service before are eligible to get one month for free. The Premium Individual plan lets you listen ad-free and skip songs at will. You can also organize your listening queue and download content for offline listening. Just be aware, your subscription will auto-renew at the end of the trial period. So if you don't want to be on the hook for the $12 monthly fee, set a reminder to cancel and go back to the free version.\nHBO Max student discount — subscribe for $5/month (50 percent off): HBO Max offers their ad-supported tier to students for half off the usual rate. You’ll just have to verify that you’re a student through Unidays, and make note that this offer is only good for up to 12 months of service.\nHulu student discount — subscribe for $2/month (75 percent off): Those with a valid student ID can get Hulu’s ad-supported tier for 75 percent off the typical rate. They’ll keep the same sale price for as long as they’re a student as well.\nSpotify student discount — Premium + Hulu with ads for $6/month (72 percent off): Spotify’s student offer continues to be one of the best around, giving you access to the Premium tier of the music streamer and Hulu’s ad-supported plan for only $6 monthly. Purchased separately, you’d pay $22 per month for both of the services. Plus, the first month is free when you sign up.\nNBA League Pass student discount — one year for $120 (40 percent off): Students can get one year of League Pass for only $10 per month, which includes access to NBA TV and the ability to watch classic and archive games on-demand. On the NBA League Pass website, look for the student discount banner at the top and follow the instructions to verify your student status.\nPeacock first responders discount — one year for $48 (50 percent off): Medical professionals and first responders can save 50 percent each year of Peacock. The deal requires annual verification and is open to those who work for either private or public institutions. Peacock has some great stuff to watch, including Poker Face and Killing It and more.\nStreaming bundle discounts\nThere’s more consolidation happening now than ever before in the streaming space, and that means there are more streaming bundle options. These bundles offer you access to more content with one subscription price, but those prices are typically higher than paying for a single service by itself (obviously). It may be tempting to just get the bundle, but if only one of those services in the bundle speaks to you, you’ll spend less overall by just paying for the single service.\nSpeaking of a deep love for a single streaming service: if all of your favorite shows are on Peacock or the latest releases on HBO Max consistently bring you joy, consider paying for one year upfront. Subscribing with an annual plan usually saves you money in the long term over paying on a monthly basis. Unfortunately, not all streaming services (looking at you, Netflix) have an annual subscription option. Here are some of the best streaming bundles you can get right now.\n \nDisney+, Hulu, HBO Max bundle with ads for $17/month: Ad-supported HBO Max is included here, along with full, ad-supported access to Disney+ and Hulu. You’ll save 43 percent with this bundle, as opposed to paying for all three services individually.\nDisney+ and Hulu Bundle Premium for $20/month: Disney and Hulu offer a few different bundles, which you can view in the drop-down lists under Choose Your Plan. This bundle removes the ads from both Disney+ and Hulu (with the exception of select live and linear content) and allows you to download content for offline viewing. You’ll save 42 percent with this bundle, as opposed to paying for both ad-free tiers individually.\nParamount+ with Showtime for $13/month or $120/year: This includes everything in Paramount+’s Essential plan, except the ads, and also provides access to Showtime content, live CBS streams and download features.\nSling TV + HBO Max starting at $53/month: Sling TV and HBO Max have partnered on a discount that gives new subscribers 50 percent off their first month of Sling TV, plus $5 off monthly when you subscribe to the Sling TV + HBO Max bundle. The standard price for the Sling Blue + HBO Max duo is roughly $58/month, so you'll get a monthly discount of $5 off that. In addition, for the first month only, you'll get half off the price of the bundle. The promotion also applies to the Sling Orange & Blue + HBO Max package, which has a standard price of $73/month.\nHulu + Live TV with Disney+ and ESPN+ for $96/month: This streaming bundle amalgamation is a bit confusing but it does offer a lot: you get live TV streaming via Hulu’s service plus access to the following VOD services: Hulu, Disney+ and ESPN+. Out of those three, only ESPN+ will have ads.\nDisney+, Hulu, ESPN+ Bundle Basic for $17/month: You get full access to Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+ content with this package, albeit with ads across the board. This bundle price is 46 percent off the total price of all three separate subscriptions.\nDisney+, Hulu, ESPN+ Bundle Premium for $27/month: Similarly to the Duo bundles, the Premium version of the Trio removes ads from most content in Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+, and you can download content for offline viewing. This price represents a 43-percent savings when compared to paying for all three ad-free tiers separately.\nRead more streaming coverage\n\nThe best live TV streaming services to cut cable\nThe best streaming services: Netflix, Hulu, HBO Max and more\nThe best streaming devices\n\nFollow @EngadgetDeals on X for the latest tech deals and buying advice.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/best-streaming-service-deals-133028980.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Apple has shipped its three billionth iPhone, Tim Cook has revealed during a call for the company's third quarter earnings. The company released the first iPhone in 2007 and sold its billionth iPhone in 2016. It is  believed to have shipped its two billionth sometime in 2021, and now only four years later, it has reached the new milestone. Apple's CEO said the iPhone enjoyed a double digit growth in the third quarter and that the company earned $94 billion in revenue, up 10 percent year over year. In a tweet, Apple expert Mark Gurman suggested that iPhone sales over the past quarter were driven by people who bought one out of fear that the device would be out of their reach in the future due to Trump's tariffs. \nApple should be very pleased with the folks who spread the lies that the iPhone will cost $3000 or $25,000 if made in the U.S. Clearly that helped a ton for the June quarter.— Mark Gurman (@markgurman) July 31, 2025\n\nSpeaking of tariffs, they cost the company $800 million in the quarter ending in June, Cook said during the call. In the next quarter ending in September, Apple believes tariffs will cost the company $1.1 billion. \nApple is slated to announce its next iPhone models in a matter of weeks, probably sometime in September like last year's devices. Gurman previously reported that Apple is releasing an iPhone 17 Air this generation to match the Air models of its other products. It will reportedly be an ultra-thin phone, as its designation implies, will have a single camera lens and be powered by a basic A19 chip. The phone could also be equipped with Apple's in-house modem that debuted with the iPhone 16e and come with a 6.6-inch screen. It could cost buyers around $900, which is around $100 more than the base iPhone 16 and is on par with the price of the iPhone 16 Plus. \nIn addition to announcing Apple's three billionth iPhone, Cook also announced during the call that the company is \"significantly growing out investments\" in artificial intelligence. He said an acquisition to boost its AI efforts and accelerate its roadmap wasn't out of the question, though he didn't name any specific company that Apple could potentially purchase.  This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/apple-has-now-shipped-3-billion-iphones-030851439.html?src=rss",
