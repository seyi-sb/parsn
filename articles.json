The story at this point remains a mystery, though the title suggests it'll take place 50 years after the events of Blade Runner 2049. Ridley Scott is said to be involved in the production.\nIt was revealed last year that Michelle Yeoh will star in the series, and according to Deadline, she'll be joined by Hunter Schafer, Dimitri Abold, Lewis Gribben, Katelyn Rose Downey and Daniel Rigby. We first heard about the possibility of Blade Runner 2099 back in 2022, when it was reported that Amazon Studios was developing a live-action series set in that universe, but there have been few updates since. The release window was noted in an internal memo obtained by Deadline, which reports that the series is now in post-production.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/tv-movies/blade-runner-2099-will-reportedly-be-released-next-year-on-prime-video-210513272.html?src=rss",

    "full_text": "In Brief In a new blog post, OpenAI warns against “unauthorized opportunities to gain exposure to OpenAI through a variety of means,” including special purpose vehicles, known as SPVs. “We urge you to be careful if you are contacted by a firm that purports to have access to OpenAI, including through the sale of an SPV interest with exposure to OpenAI equity,” the company writes. The blog post acknowledges that “not every offer of OpenAI equity […] is problematic” but says firms may be “attempting to circumvent our transfer restrictions.” “If so, the sale will not be recognized and carry no economic value to you,” OpenAI says. Investors have increasingly used SPVs (which pool money for one-off investments) as a way to buy into hot AI startups, prompting other VCs to criticize them as a vehicle for “tourist chumps.” Business Insider reports that OpenAI isn’t the only major AI company looking to crack down on SPVs, with Anthropic reportedly telling Menlo Ventures it must use its own capital, not an SPV, to invest in an upcoming round."

    "full_text": "In Brief When Amazon hired the founders of AI startup Adept last year, it was one of the first examples of what became known as a reverse acquihire — a deal where a large company hires key startup team members and licenses its technology, rather than acquiring the startup outright. Adept’s co-founder and former CEO David Luan subsequently became the head of Amazon’s new AGI Lab, and while Luan’s recent interview with The Verge is ostensibly focused on Amazon’s vision for AI agents, reporter Alex Heath also asked him about the reverse acquihire trend. Luan replied that hopes to be “remembered more as being an AI research innovator rather than a deal structure innovator,” — but from his perspective, it’s “perfectly rational” for companies like Amazon to “put together critical mass on both talent and compute right now.” As for why he was willing to leave his startup for Amazon, Luan said he wasn’t interested in turning Adept into a “an enterprise company that only sells small models,” because he wanted to solve “the four crucial remaining research problems left to AGI.” “Every single one of them is going to require two-digit billion-dollar clusters to go run it,” he said. “How else am I […] going to have the opportunity to go do that?”"

Right now, the Bose TV Speaker is down to $163.45 (about $115 off) at Amazon, the lowest price we’ve seen yet. The Bose TV Speaker is a solid starter soundbar that can easily integrate into existing setups with a simple one-cable connection (via optical or HDMI).

Additionally, the Bose TV Speaker has Bluetooth connectivity, so you can use the soundbar to listen to music or podcasts.

While Intel says the government is making an “$8.9 billion investment in Intel common stock,” the administration does not appear to be committing new funds. Specifically, the $8.9 billion is supposed to come from $5.7 billion awarded-but-not-paid to Intel under the Biden administration’s CHIPS Act, as well as $3.2 billion also awarded by the Biden administration through the Secure Enclave program. Trump has been critical of the CHIPS Act, calling it a “horrible, horrible thing” and calling on House Speaker Mike Johnson to “get rid” of it. In addition to his targeting of the CHIPS Act, earlier this month Trump also accused Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan of conflicts of interests and said he should “resign immediately.” The president was more positive about Tan on Friday, saying on Truth Social that he “negotiated this deal with Lip-Bu Tan, the Highly Respected Chief Executive Officer of the Company.” They’re here to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

Mine is an Autonomous SmartDesk 2 that’s electronic and automatic, hers an old pneumatic model by Bakker Elkhuizen that they don’t make anymore, which annoys her because it requires a bit of effort to shift up and down. It actually used to be my partner’s, while I sat in a big Duelhawk Jet Black PU gaming chair (also no longer available), until we each realized we preferred the other’s seat and swapped. I actually bought it immediately after reading a piece by my colleague Victoria Song on a different Mobvoi model, and following her advice I’ve made no attempt to touch its smart features or track my workouts; so far it’s served me well.

They can even work as a hearing aid, though their six-hour battery life still isn’t the best, and you should only get them if you’re all-in on Apple hardware. But if that’s the case, we consider them the best wireless earbuds for iPhone owners. \nApple iPad (11-inch, A16) for $299 ($50 off): Apple's entry-level iPad is, unsurprisingly, the best iPad option for those on a budget. It has solid performance thanks to the A16 chipset, 128GB of storage in the base model and good battery life.\nApple Mac mini M4 for $499 ($100 off): The newest version of Apple’s tiny desktop PC has a smaller overall footprint, a faster M4 chip, 16GB of RAM as standard, two front-facing USB-C ports, an extra Thunderbolt 4 port and the ability to drive three external displays. We gave the M4 Pro model a review score of 90.\nGoogle Pixel 10 smartphone + $100 Amazon gift card for $799 ($100 off): More of a pre-order deal than a Labor Day deal, this bundle includes a free gift card when you order the latest Google Pixel phone in advance. You'll find different gift card deals at Amazon depending on which phone you go with: the Pixel 10 Pro and Pro XL have a $200 gift cards included, while the Pixel 10 Pro Fold comes with a free $300 gift card.\nBlink Outdoor 4 security cameras (3 camera system) for $100 (47 percent off): Some of our favorite security cameras, Blink Outdoor 4 devices support 1080p video, two-way talk, motion alerts and night vision. The most convenient thing about these is that they're totally wireless and run on AA batteries that can last up to two years before you need to replace them. That combined with their weather-proof design allows you to place them both inside and outside.\nEufy 11S Max robot vacuum for $150 (46 percent off): This model is one of our favorite budget robot vacuums thanks to its slim design that lets you get underneath furniture more easily and strong suction power for its size. Note that it does not have Wi-Fi connectivity, but it comes with a remote that lets you control the robot to your liking.\nShark AI Ultra robot vacuum for $298 (50 percent off): This Shark robot vacuum is a version of one of our favorites and it comes with a auto-empty base that can hold up to 60 days worth of debris. It has strong suction power and home mapping capabilities, so you can tailor cleaning jobs to your liking in addition to putting the robot on a cleaning schedule.\nCosori 9-in-1 air fryer for $90 (25 percent off): One of our picks for the best air fryers, this Cosori model has a spacious six-quart cooking basket and nine prep modes to choose from. In our testing, it consistently crisped up all kinds of foods, from frozen appetizers to raw proteins, and it has a nifty safety feature with its built-in basket release button.\nHORI Piranha Plant camera for Switch 2 for $40 (33 percent off): If you plan on taking advantage of the Switch 2's video and group chat feature, there's no cuter way to do it than with this Piranha Plant camera. In addition to using it with the pot as a stand, the plant itself detaches from the pot so you can use the camera in portable mode with the USB port on the new console.\nESPN Unlimited with Disney+ and Hulu (with ads) for $30/month ($6/month off): ESPN’s new streaming service is officially available now, and new subscribers can get Disney+ and Hulu included for one year when they sign up. The regular price of the new ESPN Unlimited plan is $30 per month, but this bundle offer throws in Disney+ and Hulu (with ads) for one year at no extra cost. If you want to break it down, you’re essentially getting each of the three services for $10 monthly with this offer.\nNordVPN deal — Get up to 77 percent off two-year plans: Most of NordVPN's two-year plans are on sale right now. You'll get 77 percent off the Prime tier, bringing the price down to $189 for 27 months of service (Nord throws in an extra three months for free). Arguably the best plan for most people is the Plus tier, which is 73 percent off and down to $108 for the 27-month term.\nMasterClass deal — Get 50 percent off one-year subscriptions: You can sign up for one year of MasterClass access for as low as $5 per month thanks to this sale that runs through September 1.

It might not look a million miles from stock Android, but the out-of-the-box experience is quite different. You can install open-source apps, or Play Store alternatives like Google and Samsung’s. There’s one big durability downside, though: it only has an IP55 rating for dust and water protection — good, but not great — which is the drawback of a repairable design that swaps glue for less watertight screws. So while the Fairphone 6 is more repairable than other alternatives, there’s a slightly higher risk of needing that repair in the first place, at least when it comes to sand and water. Spare parts are sold by Fairphone and iFixit, with a promise to stock them for years. A Torx T5 screwdriver is all you need to take the phone apart. But pure power isn’t the differentiating factor it once was, so even if the Fairphone 6 is less powerful than its counterparts, it’s still powerful enough for most of us. Still, improvements in software support and durability from other manufacturers have made Fairphone’s offering less unique — though no one offers repairability like this. There are small compromises, but it remains a fair choice for just about anyone."

The last mainline entry was originally released more than a decade ago, but by the end of 2025, there will be three new Ninja Gaiden titles. But there’s a new 2D game, too. Early on, Kenji’s body becomes inhabited by the spirit of Kumori, a member of the rival Black Spider clan who adds throwable kunai weapons to Kenji’s arsenal and is briefly playable in special sections. Most enemies can be killed with one hit, but a few bigger ones take a few attacks to wear down and are better at standing their ground. However, you can get a superpowered strike that defeats those bigger foes in one shot by killing nearby enemies with glowing auras around them. Fortunately, the game has an Assist Mode you can activate whenever you want to tweak the difficulty, which I often used to turn down the damage so I could persevere through a battle for a little bit longer or just to help me get unstuck. I loved exploring the game’s levels, which are drawn with gorgeous pixel art and take place in some creative locales, like a pirate cave and a construction site. There are also hidden collectibles, including scarabs you can use to unlock upgrades and scrolls that open up extra-hard secret stages. It’s just weird to see Kumori, a badass ninja lady, say “good grief” to kick off one of the levels."

These sites allow their users to post anonymously, and they’re unsurprising targets for Ofcom, whose initial complaint against 4Chan said that the site had failed to offer a risk assessment about its userbase and was not complying with Ofcom “safety duties.” The complaint said 4chan could be subject to the law’s general fine of either £18 million or 10 percent of qualifying worldwide revenue, whichever is greater. Ofcom declined to comment, citing the complaint’s status as an ongoing investigation. The administration’s protection of American speech abroad would stand in stark contrast with its approach inside the country, where the same State Department that’s pushing back against Europe’s digital laws is also using social media posts to deny and revoke student visa applications, targeting them for posting pro-Palestine content online. That is entirely a domestic UK matter for Ofcom and the British courts to decide upon.”"

    "summary": "Welcome to our latest recap of what's going on in the indie game space. It's been a very busy week in that realm, thanks to Gamescom. Before we jam through a few of this week's new releases and some of the many, many Gamescom reveals, there's one game that has risen high above the din to the point where it's drowning out many of the smaller announcements.\nYes, Hollow Knight: Silksong has a release date, and it's very, very soon. September 4, in fact. I feel for all the developers who have games coming out around the same time, such as Cronos: The New Dawn, Hell is Us, Baby Steps and even NBA 2K26. Sure, Silksong may primarily be for a different audience than the latest edition of a massive basketball franchise, but it's going to take up much of the oxygen in the gaming space for a while. As such, some developers are delaying their games to give Silksong a wide berth.\nCloverPit was scheduled to drop on September 3, but it's getting the hell out of Silksong's way. The grimy, slot machine-based roguelike is now going to arrive on September 26. \"We like a gamble, but this one is too risky lol,\" developer Panik Arcade said. \"We want to give ourselves and our fans some time to enjoy Silksong, so we’re launching a few weeks later and will use the time to polish CloverPit even further.\" Meanwhile, Talegames is pushing back the 1.0 release of its adventure RPG Faeland and Aeternum Game Studios is delaying a Metroidvania called Aeterna Lucis from September into 2026.\nThere's no doubt that Silksong's arrival is a big deal. It's been the most wishlisted game on Steam for yonks, was a focus of Microsoft's Xbox Ally handheld reveal and is a sequel to an indie blockbuster that has now sold more than 15 million copies. In any case, we'll soon find out if that very, very long wait was worthwhile. Years of Silksong memes sure were. I’m going to need some other long-awaited game to joke about before every showcase now.\nNew releases\n\nI have no earthly idea why it took me so long to try this, but I tested my PlayStation Portal by my building's pool for the first time this week and it turned out that the Wi-Fi was, in fact, strong enough there for me to use the handheld. It was a fitting place to check out Sword of the Sea, which hit PS5 (including on PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium) and PC this week.\nI'm only an hour or so into this $30 game from Giant Squid, but I'm enjoying the relaxed approach to exploration here. As you'd might expect from developers who have worked on The Pathless, Abzu and Journey, the movement in Sword of the Sea is delightful. You'll take off from wavy dunes and pull off tricks like you're in an SSX game as you surf across sand and water on a sword in the aim of restoring life to the barren landscape. Sword of the Sea is a looker, and I'll surely be getting lost in it some more over the coming days.\n\nSpeaking of games that have an eye-catching aesthetic, Herdling is another exploration and adventure title that dropped this week. This one's from Okomotive (Far: Changing Tides, Far: Lone Sails) and publisher Panic.\nHere, you'll be guiding a ragtag herd of beasts across hilly terrain toward the summit of a mountain. You'll have to solve some \"light\" environmental puzzles and even endure some stampedes along the way. Herdling typically costs $25, but there's a 25 percent launch discount. It's available on Steam, Epic Games Store, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, Nintendo Switch and Switch 2. It's on Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass too.\n\nWith Ball x Pit on the horizon, I figured we were all taken care of for the foreseeable future as far as Breakout-esque roguelites go. Not so fast, said the team behind Vampire Survivors. \nPoncle has spun up its own publishing arm and the second game it's releasing (after Berserk or Die) is Kill the Brickman from Doonutsaur. Poncle released the game on Steam and Xbox without prior warning this week, and it costs five bucks.\nYou'll collect and augment various bullets that you use to destroy bricks from outer space. There's a lot going on in the minute-long trailer, but I particularly love how some of the bricks \"cry\" when a bullet smacks into them.\n\nDiscounty is a life sim about managing a supermarket in a small town. Hopefully, you'll be a more magnanimous proprietor than the operators of the JoJa Mart in Stardew Valley, but you'll still have to deal with some folks who are none too pleased about the effect of the business on their town.\nDeveloper Crinkle Cut Games and publisher PQube suggest there are some secrets to discover in Discounty, which is out now on Nintendo Switch, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, Steam and Epic Games Store. It's coming to GOG as well at a later date. The game typically costs $20, though there's a 20 percent launch discount on PC.\nUpcoming\n\nEngadget senior reporter Igor Bonifacic spent a few hours with Absolum, a fantasy beat-'em-up with a roguelite spin from co-developers Guard Crush Games and Supamonk and publisher Dotemu (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge, Streets of Rage 4). I highly recommend reading his write up for the full lowdown as Absolum sounds like a real treat.\nThe demo for this slipped through the cracks for me during the early June chaos of Summer Game Fest and Steam Next Fest, but it's still available and I'll absolutely be checking it out to get a taste of Absolum before it arrives on October 4. It's coming to Steam, Nintendo Switch, PS4 and PS5.\n\nAs I mentioned in our liveblog for Gamescom Opening Night Live this week, any new Ron Gilbert game is worth getting excited about. He's the director of the first two Monkey Island games and Return to Monkey Island, as well as a developer and producer of so many other projects over the years. Death by Scrolling. is something completely different for Gilbert.\nIt's a vertical-scrolling, action-heavy roguelite in which you need to stay alive and earn enough gold to pay a toll to a ferryman to escape from the afterlife. The look is very heavily reminiscent of Stardew, so if plundering the mines in that game was more your jam than farming and fishing, this might be up your alley. \nThere's no release date as yet for Death by Scrolling, which Gilbert started working on back in 2019, but it's said to be coming this year. In the meantime, you can read updates about the game's development on Gilbert's terrific blog.\n\nIt's fun that we had mentions of two John Carpenter-related projects at Gamescom this week. Not only was there another look at John Carpenter's Toxic Commando during Opening Night Live, there was the reveal of Halloween the Game from IllFonic and co-publisher Gun Interactive.\nSet to arrive in 2026, Halloween the Game follows the likes of Friday the 13th: The Game (from the same teams) and the Gun-published The Texas Chain Saw Massacre. It has a 1 vs. 4 asynchronous multiplayer mode in which the quartet will have to use anything at their disposal — from wielding weapons to calling the cops — to survive the threat of the unkillable Michael Myers. There's going to be a single-player aspect to this game as well, as you'll be able to control the legendary mass killer in an adaptation of the original film's story. Halloween the Game is coming to PlayStation, Xbox, Steam and Epic Games Store.\n\nA game about a guy with a brown backpack who scours ruined, overgrown suburban homes in search of valuable resources that can help him survive a bunch of zombies in the post-apocalypse? It has to be Long Gone, of course! What other game could you possibly be thinking of?\nThis is a linear pixel-art narrative adventure from Hillfort Games and co-publisher Outersloth (Among Us studio Innersloth's publishing wing). The developers seem to have been influenced by a little game you might have heard of called... Gone Home, as you'll look through the belongings of people who used to live in this world and learn the truth about what happened. There's no combat here. Instead, zombie encounters require puzzle solving. There's no release window as yet for this point-and-click game, which is coming to Steam.\n\nFittingly enough, I've had my eye on Militsoner for some time, so I was delighted to hear that there's a two-week playtest on Steam that's open to everyone. This is an immersive sim in which you'll try to escape a town, but that may not be too easy as there's an enormous policeman watching your every move. The playtest is limited to a slice of the town, but I'm really looking forward to getting in there and finding out what this is all about.\n\nI have to hold my hands up here and admit I'm not familiar with puzzle game maker Rusty Lake. But when the trailer for their next game popped up this week, it had me utterly captivated, because Servant of the Lake looks very, very pretty.\nThis is a point-and-click puzzle adventure that will see you carrying out tasks as seemingly innocuous as straightening picture frames to helping with experiments and cleaning up afterward. You'll play as a housekeeper of an estate, but it's not entirely clear whether you'll be able to survive the weekend... Servant of the Lake is coming to Steam, Itch.io, iOS and Android in Spring 2026.\n\nBPM: Bullets Per Minute developer Awe Interactive is back with another rhythm-based shooter, albeit one that has a top-down perspective instead of a first-person one. BPM Bitcrushed (which is being published by Kwalee) is a roguelite, pixel art dungeon crawler that syncs shooting, jumping and dodging to the beat. The dungeons are procedurally generated and there's a \"wide variety of powerful weapons, unique items and rhythm-based abilities\" to discover. \nWhat's most interesting to me here though is that, along with the game's own soundtrack, you can load in your own tunes via the custom music feature. Perhaps setting the action to some slow-tempo sludge metal will make things a bit easier.\n\nCouch Planes is an arcade plane racer from Skylab Interactive that's coming to Steam, Epic Games Store and consoles next year. There are a few different modes, 15 maps with environmental hazards and collectable power ups including homing rockets, mines and speed boosts. There's support for four-person local multiplayer and 12-player online action. \nFrom Starfox and Grand Theft Auto V to The Falconeer and Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, I've never been much good at flying in games. But hey, Couch Planes looks like it could be a fun time with friends.\n\nLet's close out this bumper post-Gamescom edition of our indie games roundup with something that might not be for me, but could be for you. Canvas City is the first project from Disc 2 Games, which is self-publishing the game with help from Dredge studio Black Salt Games. \nTurn-based tactics games aren't typically my jam, but I'm always going to have at least some interest in one that's about a group of upstarts rebelling against an oppressive force. In this case, you'll take charge of skaters and street artists who are fighting back in a \"vibrant yet suppressed urban world\" (which sounds a little similar to Unbeatable, which this week got a November 6 release date). \nWhat caught my attention here is that fluid movement is a key part of the game. When it's your turn, you can use rails, ramps and other parts of the environment to pull off combinations of tricks and attacks. These chained actions can also earn you Style Points that can enhance your abilities.\nDisc 2 hasn't revealed a release window for Canvas City as yet. It's in development for Steam and Nintendo Switch.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/surfing-sand-and-sea-herding-beasts-and-other-new-indie-games-worth-checking-out-110053175.html?src=rss",

Learn what brightness your current floodlights are and if you want that to change. Lower brightness is easier on the eyes and better for indoor use. LED bulbs can often be seem very bright even at their equivalent wattage brightness, so you many want to choose a lower brightness if you’re moving from incandescent. No matter what you pick, you'll want to look for a durable bulb that puts out at least 650 lumens of brightness from a power draw of 10 watts or fewer. With bulb-specific dimming hardware built right in, most smart bulbs will dim with flawless, flicker- and buzz-free precision via their app or through some other integration like an Amazon Alexa voice command. You won't need to use dimmer switches associated with those light fixtures at all. LED bulbs used to be quite cold, but modern upgrades have given them a range of color temperatures. Either way, it’s an important consideration: Homeowners typically prefer a very warm color temperature for any indoor lighting."

These are the words I used to get those hints but any words of four or more letters that you find will work: When you have all of them (I originally thought there were always eight but learned that the number can vary), every letter on the board will be used. To find it, look for the M that's five letters down on the far-left row, and wind across."

    "summary": "President Donald Trump says the US government is taking a 10 percent stake in chip maker Intel. Trump shared the news during a press conference on Friday, though an official announcement is still forthcoming, Reuters reports. News of a plan to convert Intel's previously promised CHIPS Act funding into equity in the company was first reported earlier in August.\nA meeting between Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan and Trump following the President's call for Tan to resign seems to be the source of the deal. \"He walked in wanting to keep his job and he ended up giving us 10 billion dollars for the United States. So we picked up 10 billion,\" Trump shared during the press conference. \nIntel later announced more details on the investment. The company said in a press release that the government will \"make an $8.9 billion investment in Intel common stock.\" It adds that the equity stake will be funded by $5.7 billion previously earmarked for Intel as part of the CHIPS act, and $3.2 billion awarded as part of the Secure Enclave program. Intel had previously recieved $2.2 billion in CHIPS grants, bringing the government's total spend on the chipmaker to $11.1 billion. The government paid $20.47 per share, so the $8.9 billion investment is equivalent to a 9.9 percent stake in the company. \nIt's important to note that the government investing in Intel is not the same thing as receiving free money, it's the exact opposite. Despite earlier comments from US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick suggesting the stake would be non-voting, common stock does come with voting rights. Intel does note that the investment will be passive, with no board representation, and that the government has agreed to vote with its board of directors \"on matters requiring shareholder approval, with limited exceptions.\"\nIntel was supposed to receive up to $10.86 billion in federal funding to expand its chip manufacturing business in the US as part of the CHIPS Act. By agreeing to this deal, Tan is likely trying to make sure that funding still goes through, one of several drastic moves to keep Intel afloat. Tan assumed the title of CEO following Pat Gelsinger's sudden retirement in 2024. Since taking over, he's already committed to cutting Intel's workforce by 20 percent. Even with lower costs and guaranteed investment, the company's future is still uncertain: Intel is reportedly struggling to make its next-gen Panther Lake chips at scale. \nThe Trump administration says it won't seek similar equity deals with other recipients of CHIPS act funding. That hasn't stopped them from making other equally unprecedented financial arrangements. NVIDIA and AMD reportedly struck a deal with the US government that gives the companies the ability to export products to China in exchange for 15 percent of their profits.\nUpdate, August 22, 6:20PM ET: This story was updated after publish with more information on the deal from Intel, and the headline was changed to the dollar figure, rather than the previously stated \"10 percent\" amount. A section quoting US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick saying that the stake was non-voting was also ammended to reflect the final details of the deal.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/the-us-government-is-taking-an-89-billion-stake-in-intel-205047795.html?src=rss",

Apple is suing a former employee on the Apple Watch team who left to join Oppo, alleging that he “conspired to steal Apple’s trade secrets relating to Apple Watch and to disclose them to his new employers.” Ahead of starting his new job at Oppo, the employee, Dr. Chen Shi, attended “dozens” of meetings with technical members on the Apple Watch team to learn about their work and downloaded 63 documents “from a protected Box folder” that he loaded onto a USB drive, according to the lawsuit. Shi allegedly sent a message to Oppo saying that he was working to “collect as much information as possible” before starting his job. And he searched the internet for terms like “how to wipe out macbook” and “Can somebody see if I’ve opened a file on a shared drive?” from his Apple-issued MacBook before leaving the company. Shi was formerly a sensor system architect at Apple, and the company says he had “a front row seat to Apple’s development of its cutting-edge health sensor technology, including highly confidential roadmaps, design and development documents, and specifications for ECG sensor technology.” He now heads up a team working on sensing technology at Oppo — which Apple says it learned because of “messages he left on his Apple-issued work iPhone.” In his resignation letter to Apple, Shi said he was leaving “due to personal and family reasons.” Via that iPhone, Apple also says it found messages from Oppo demonstrating that it “encouraged, approved, and agreed to Dr. Shi’s plan to collect Apple’s proprietary information before leaving Apple.” When The Verge tried to contact Oppo for comment, the email bounced back because the mailbox was full."

    "full_text": "Netflix has already faced backlash over the use of AI in What Jennifer Did, director Jenny Popplewell’s 2024 true crime documentary that seemingly used AI-generated images in place of real archival photos. That documentary stood out as a shining example of gen AI’s ability to distort reality in situations where people are specifically looking to be told the truth about something. This week, Netflix published a post on its Partner Help Center hub detailing its guiding principles regarding gen AI and the situations in which it is ok with production teams using the technology. “Most low-risk use cases that follow the guiding principles below are unlikely to require legal review. Where possible, generative tools are used in an enterprise-secured environment to safeguard inputs. But if partners are unsure or know that they’re not adhering to the rules, they should escalate to your Netflix contact for more guidance before proceeding, as written approval may be required.” The post repeatedly stresses that while Netflix is very open to its partners using gen AI in a number of ways, it wants them to be mindful of the potential legal risks they might wander into by not running their plans by management and the company’s legal team beforehand. The post also makes a point of emphasizing that Netflix believes “audiences should be able to trust what they see and hear on screen.” And given gen AI’s potential to “blur the line between fiction and reality or unintentionally mislead viewers,” the streamer wants its partners to tread carefully. Though the post does not mention production costs, all of this comes just a few weeks after Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos said that the company remains “convinced that AI represents an incredible opportunity to help creators make films and series better, not just cheaper.” Soon after, Sarandos began pointing to Netflix’s new Argentinian sci-fi series The Eternaut as an example of how gen AI could be used to bring a show in under budget. And now it seems like Netflix is very keen on other creative teams embracing that kind of workflow."

    "full_text": "Bluesky will block access from Mississippi IP addresses in response to a new state law requiring age verification and parental consent for underage users. “Mississippi’s approach would fundamentally change how users access Bluesky,” says the post, in ways that rules like the UK’s Online Safety Act (which Bluesky complies with) don’t. The law, HB 1126, “would block everyone from accessing the site — teens and adults — unless they hand over sensitive information, and once they do, the law in Mississippi requires Bluesky to keep track of which users are children.” In the UK, by contrast, users are only blocked from accessing direct messages and sensitive content unless they undergo a verification process using a third-party tool. “Building the required verification systems, parental consent workflows, and compliance infrastructure would require significant resources that our small team is currently unable to spare as we invest in developing safety tools and features for our global community, particularly given the law’s broad scope and privacy implications.” HB 1126 is one of numerous attempts to age-gate social media in the US, but most similar laws have been blocked under court challenges as likely unconstitutional. HB 1126 went into effect thanks to an unexplained decision by the Supreme Court earlier this month, rejecting an emergency request to block it while a legal challenge progresses. While the court has said that age verification can be used to block minors from accessing explicit sexual content without unduly burdening adults’ access to information, there’s no precedent extending that option to social media in general. Now, however, Bluesky users who log in from inside the borders of Mississippi (without a VPN, anyway) will be met with a message explaining the decision. “Child safety is a core priority, and in this evolving regulatory landscape, we remain committed to building an open social ecosystem that protects users while preserving choice and innovation,” the post says. “We’ll keep you updated as this situation develops.”"

The partnership with Midjourney ties directly into Meta’s goals for AI imagery across its services. The Meta AI app is built around a feed of AI-generated images and videos. There are options to generate AI images within chats in WhatsApp and Instagram, too. Midjourney got on the map for its AI image and video generation tools. “We are incredibly impressed by Midjourney,” Wang says. “They have accomplished true feats of technical and aesthetic excellence, and we are thrilled to be working more closely with them.” The two companies will share more about what they’re working on together “soon.”"

    "full_text": "Social networking startup Bluesky has made the decision to block access to its service in the state of Mississippi, rather than comply with a new age assurance law. In a blog post published on Friday, the company explains that, as a small team, it doesn’t have the resources to make the substantial technical changes this type of law would require, and it raised concerns about the law’s broad scope and privacy implications. Mississippi’s HB 1126 requires platforms to introduce age verification for all users before they can access social networks like Bluesky. As a result, Bluesky had to decide what it would do about compliance. That means Bluesky would have to verify every user’s age and obtain parental consent for anyone under 18. This is different from how it’s expected to comply with other age verification laws, like the U.K.’s Online Safety Act (OSA), which only requires age checks for certain content and features. Mississippi’s law blocks anyone from using the site unless they provide their personal and sensitive information. “Unlike tech giants with vast resources, we’re a small team focused on building decentralized social technology that puts users in control,” the company’s blog post read. “Age verification systems require substantial infrastructure and developer time investments, complex privacy protections, and ongoing compliance monitoring — costs that can easily overwhelm smaller providers. This dynamic entrenches existing big tech platforms while stifling the innovation and competition that benefits users,” it noted."

Instead, Apple’s support documents indicate that IT administrators will be able to restrict or allow any “external” artificial intelligence provider, not just OpenAI’s technology. As Apple has rolled out new AI features aimed at its devices’ end users — like writing tools or visual intelligence, for example — it’s also rolled out ways for IT departments to control access to those features. That’s why it leaves it up to businesses to decide if data should be processed in the cloud or on the device, for example. While AI updates are a highlight of the enterprise-related updates due out in the fall, Apple is also rolling out other new features to its largest customers. It’s also debuting new tools for Device Management to make it easier to migrate devices to a different management service — something that often comes up in M&A scenarios when a new company takes over employee devices and assets. Apple’s Return to Service solution, which lets devices quickly get wiped and readied for the next user, will now offer the option to leave all apps installed, saving time and bandwidth since IT admins and users won’t need to reinstall them. On shared Macs, an authenticated Guest Mode lets employees log in with account credentials from their identity provider, then has their data (but not apps) erased upon logout. These tools will also roll out in September as part of Apple’s broader software updates for iPhone, iPad, Mac and more.

    "summary": "Last week, Samsung announced the world's first Micro RGB TV and while it sounded fantastic on paper, you can never really get a good sense of what a fresh display looks like until you see it in person. But after going to Samsung's new headquarters in New Jersey, I can attest that it is truly a sight to behold.\nNow, before we get to the TV itself, it's probably a good idea to dive into what's going on with Samsung's latest panel tech. In many ways, Micro RGB is a step up from current Mini LED screens. On a technical level, the Micro LEDs and the self-emissive pixels of Samsung's The Wall probably remain the more sophisticated end goal for next-gen TVs.\nAt its core, Micro RGB is still based on LCD tech, the difference is that instead of using blue or white backlighting like a lot of sets today, it features individually controlled red, green and blue Micro LEDs (hence the name Micro RGB) to produce an even wider range of colors. The result is that Samsung claims this is the first TV to cover 100 percent of the BT.2020 standard. For context, that covers more than 75 percent of the visible spectrum and has an even wider color range than what you get from DCI-P3, which is one of the most commonly used high-end standards for modern filmmaking.\nIn person, that means the TV can produce stunningly rich and vivid colors that put Samsung's other top-tier TVs to shame, including the new Neo QLED QN90F which starts at a whopping $26,999. Like its sibling, Samsung's Micro RGB TV is only available in one size (115 inches) and has a similar design, while its panel features a 144Hz refresh rate and a matte glare-free coating. But that's kind of where the similarities end, because this new flagship model features four times the number of dimming zones. Furthermore, because the Micro RGB LEDs require more computing power to manage all those pixels, Samsung had to create a new RGB Engine AI processor to properly control everything.\nIn short, this is a lot of words to describe what might be the best-looking TV I've ever seen. While I only got to view some demo footage (which admittedly is designed to make the set look its best), I couldn't help but appreciate the sheer intensity of the hues and shades on display. When the video loop shifted to primarily blue and green scenes, the TV's color depth was almost overwhelming. That said, due to the immense size of the panel, when you get up close, it's easy to see individual pixels. However, when you're sitting in its sweet spot (about 11.5 feet from the display), everything looks ridiculously sharp and overflows with detail. And even for those off-center, there appeared to be no falloff in brightness or saturation.\nWhile Samsung's $26,999 Neo QLED QN90F boasts a price tag that's nearly as expensive as the $29,999 Micro RGB TV, there's still a very obvious difference in color. Sam Rutherford for Engadget\nNow, of course, the major downside of Samsung's new Micro RGB TV is that at $29,999, it makes everything but The Wall (which starts at a cool $40,000) seem cheap. But the funny thing is that when compared to the Neo QLED QN90F, which Samsung also had on display in a nearby room, the difference in quality and color was immediately obvious. This sort of makes me wonder why anyone with super deep pockets would even consider the latter just to save a few thousand dollars, because when you see them in person, there's no doubt which set is superior.\nUnfortunately, the Micro RGB's full glory doesn't translate across the internet due to the much more limited specs of the web. It's one of those things you need to see for yourself to fully grasp. But if you're the kind of person with enough money that you don't need to care about price tags, Samsung's latest flagship should be an immediate contender as the centerpiece in your mansion.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/samsungs-new-29999-micro-rgb-tv-looks-ridiculously-good-194629549.html?src=rss",

Government equity stakes in private companies are extremely rare in the U.S. and highly controversial, with notable exceptions occurring during the 2008-2009 financial crisis when the government took temporary ownership stakes in companies like General Motors, AIG, and a few major banks to prevent economic collapse. The Intel deal, which is expected to be announced later Friday, comes days after the Japanese conglomerate SoftBank agreed to make a $2 billion investment in Intel. That deal was couched as a commitment to advanced technology and semiconductors in the U.S. Under that agreement, SoftBank agreed to buy Intel common stock at $23 per share."

A TikTok spokesperson told TechCrunch that the Chinese-owned social media platform’s ban by the Indian government remains in place, and the short-video platform is not accessible in the country. “We have not restored access to TikTok in India and continue to comply with the Government of India’s directive,” the spokesperson said in a statement emailed to TechCrunch. A senior official at India’s IT Ministry also confirmed to TechCrunch, on condition of anonymity, that the government has not “unblocked or done anything” to revoke the ban imposed under Section 69A of the IT Act. Earlier on Friday, several local media outlets — including leading Indian dailies — suggested that TikTok was making a comeback in India after its website was briefly accessible to some Indian users. The reports cited posts on social media from users who claimed the site loaded without a VPN — an unusual development, given that the Indian government has blocked access to TikTok since late June 2020, when it banned the short-video platform along with dozens of other Chinese-linked apps amid rising tensions between the two countries. The brief and sudden reappearance of TikTok in India appears to be the result of a network-level misconfiguration. A similar incident occurred in September 2022, when some internet service providers inadvertently unblocked TikTok and other restricted sites for certain users while applying a patch, a source familiar with the matter told TechCrunch at the time.

What it didn’t announce is a Gemini-powered smart home speaker, but it might have snuck one into the presentation as an easter egg.\nAs spotted by The Verge, about 15 minutes into the stream, on a table next to F1 driver Lando Norris during a Gemini demonstration, you can clearly see what looks a lot like a smart speaker. The fabric-wrapped device we see in the video is white with a light around its base, and it looks more like an upside down HomePod mini than any of Google's other speakers. According to Android Headlines, it’s called the Google Home Speaker, and is unsurprisingly powered by Gemini.\nAndroid Headlines claims to have seen more images of the as-yet unannounced smart speaker, which it says will also be available in red, light green and black. It adds that Google’s Gemini Live AI assistant will be a baked-in feature for voice conversations, though without a screen or camera there’s no visual element here. There could also be new natural voice options on the speaker, as well as standard features like media control and smart home automations. It can reportedly also detect unusual sounds like breaking glass or smoke alarms and can send an alert to your phone or tablet if this happens.\nAccording to the Android Headlines report, the Home Speaker can pair with a Google TV Streamer and double as an additional surround sound speaker, much like the HomePod does with Apple TV. It functions as a smart hub too, with support for Matter. Google announced Gemini for Home this week, which will gradually replace Google Assistant on the company’s existing smart devices, with free and paid tiers offered to users.\nWhat the leak doesn’t contain is a launch date for this mysterious speaker. But given that Google was seemingly happy enough to have one sitting there in its most important keynote of the year, the smart money would be on an official reveal pretty soon. Engadget reached out to Google for comment, but the company said it had nothing to share at this time.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/googles-first-gemini-smart-speaker-detailed-in-leak-164227031.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "August is almost over, which means we're getting closer to the Apple iPhone event — it usually takes place in mid-September. That also means we'll finally get to officially lay eyes on the iPhone 17 lineup. The latest iOS 26 features will come preinstalled on the new models, as well as any additional features Apple reveals at the launch event. But since we (presumably) still have to wait a few weeks until the iPhone event, we can only speculate what the new devices will look like. As with most unreleased iPhones, rumors and leaks have trickled in about the hardware side ahead of the official introduction. Here's what we're expecting and what we can reasonably assume we'll get from Apple in September.\nWhat are the latest iPhone 17 rumors?\nCould new \"TechWoven\" cases be introduced with the latest iPhone 17 lineup? That's what leaker Majin Bu claims, per a MacRumors report. The cases match the rumored design on the iPhone 17 models, with the wide camera bump. MacRumors says this could be a revamped version of the much-maligned FineWoven case, which was discontinued due to being susceptible to scratches and stains.\nThe leaker noted there are two lanyard holes for \"convenient and secure carrying,\" so it could be worn around your neck.\nMore recently, the same leaker shared what they allege to be the case colors, in a post titled \"New TechWoven Case Colors for iPhone 17 Revealed.\" The colors shown in the image are grey/black, blue, green, purple and orange.\nNew TechWoven Case Colors for iPhone 17 RevealedFull Article: https://t.co/nSA8Wbek5G pic.twitter.com/W6fZdb8psn— Majin Bu (@MajinBuOfficial) August 21, 2025\n\nThis is just a rumor and we won't know what the actual iPhone 17 models or accessories will look like until Apple's iPhone event next month. That said, the shared photos (including the one embedded above) are more convincing than usual.\nHow much will the iPhone 17 cost?\nApple's announced plan to expand US-based manufacturing partners seems to give it at least some shielding from the steepest Trump administration tariffs that have already triggered price increases on everything from Switch consoles to high-end cameras to Sonos speakers. But given that President Trump's trade policies can change from week to week, and Apple's continuing reliance on Asia-based supply chains, price shocks remain an ongoing possibility. The bigger question is: Will Apple absorb any higher costs, or pass them on to consumers? \nIf prices do creep up, Apple may choose to pair it with an \"upgrade.\" Consider this recent rumor posted by MacRumors from a leaker known as \"Instant Digital,\" suggesting that the default storage of the iPhone 17 line may start at 256GB, doubling the current 128GB baseline. While that could be accompanied by a price increase of $50, Apple could at least pitch it as a \"better value.\" That said, the company doubled the default RAM of its Mac computers from 8GB to 16GB at no extra cost in 2024 — but that was before the current Trump tariff cycle started.\nWhen will the iPhone 17 series be announced?\nMost years, the flagship smartphones are introduced in September. MacRumors highlighted a story originally reported by iphone-ticker.de that the Apple iPhone 17 event could be Tuesday, September 9, according to information gleaned from German mobile phone providers.\nIt's still too early to have the specific dates; some years, Apple only gives a week or two of lead time between sending invites and hosting the event. But years of past precedent show that sometime in September should be when the 17 models make their debut. This family of smartphones may be the last to follow that trend, however. There have been hints that the introduction of the iPhone 18 collection in 2026 will be split into a pro-tier announcement in the fall and a standard model announcement the following spring.\nWhat will the new iPhone 17 lineup include?\nDesign leaks suggest that Apple is building an ultra-thin smartphone, likely to be named the iPhone 17 Air to match Apple's ultralight laptop designation. Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, often a solid source of advanced intel about Apple, reported in January that the iPhone 17 Air will be equipped with a basic A19 chip and will only have a single camera lens. It may also use Apple's new in-house modem, which was introduced in February on the iPhone 16e. More details about this development may leak ahead of September, but that's what we know for now.\nAn investor note from Apple analyst Jeff Pu indicated that the Air will have a titanium frame. If his reports are accurate, the lightweight smartphone will be the only entry in the iPhone 17 lineup to use that metal; the iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone 17 Pro Max are expected to be made of aluminum, which is oddly a lighter material than titanium. Other speculation had suggested that the Air would use a blend of aluminum and titanium, so the exact materials may not be known until the official announcement.\nAdditionally, an August 4 MacRumors report says the internal battery pack of the iPhone Air is just 2.49mm thick — half the thickness of the iPhone 17 Pro battery. The leak was posted on the Korean-language Naver blog, where they show the alleged batteries of the iPhone 17 Air and 17 Pro side by side. The same account claimed the 17 Air's battery capacity was a mere 2,800 mAh, MacRumors notes. (That's below the battery capacity of current iPhone 16 models.)\nOn a similar topic, an iPhone 17 Pro production leak appears to have revealed an all-aluminum chassis, according to MacRumors. Originally posted by leaker Majin Bu, the image shows a shell that has a large round hole on the back (where the Apple logo typically is) to allow for MagSafe charging. MacRumors says this could just be a molding but notes that the aluminum frame (versus the current titanium in Pro iPhone models) would yield a significantly lower weight.\nThat same leaker (Majin Bu), whom MacRumors classifies as a \"hit-or-miss leaker,\" suggests the iPhone 17 Pro will have better wireless signal strength thanks to an updated antenna design. The individual posted a render on X that shows a new antenna system that wraps around the iPhone 17 Pro's supposedly wider rear camera bump. Again, this is a render, not a real-world photo. That said, we can't knock the goal of better wireless reception, so we're hoping this one has a degree of truth to it.\nEach new roster includes a base model, but over the years, Apple has shaken up the variety of phones it offers. Most likely there will be an iPhone 17 and an iPhone 17 Pro. Apple has also committed to the size matters philosophy, and has been building an iPhone Pro Max option with an even bigger screen and better battery life; the 17 roster will almost certainly have one as well. \nThe new Pro iPhones are said to have a full-width \"camera island\" on the rear, which would mark the first time an Apple model opted for that design. This feature can be seen in the purported iPhone 17 \"spotted in the wild.\" The pics, highlighted on MacRumors, show a black cased iPhone (17 Pro?) with the distinct back panel. Is it the real deal? The dual angles lend a degree of credibility in a social media landscape increasingly polluted with AI-enhanced fakes, but your guess is as good as ours.\nI just spotted a test development iPhone in the wild 🤩🤩🤩 pic.twitter.com/iS3PtKWqxJ— Fox Pupy 🦊🧡 (@Skyfops) July 28, 2025\n\nThe iPhone 17 Air seems primed to take the place of a potential iPhone 17 Plus. Since the iPhone 16e was only just introduced in February at a surprisingly high price point, it seems unlikely that there will be a new addition to that lower end of the spectrum, the models that were previously called SE. \nAt the very least, it sounds like the iPhone 17 Air won't take away the charging port and rely only on wireless connectivity. Bloomberg said that while Apple had investigated making the iPhone 17 Air without a single port, the company (fortunately) changed plans. He also says that the rumored phone will have a 6.6-inch screen and include the Dynamic Island and Camera Control button. Finally, the price is rumored at $900 — likely more than the standard iPhone 17 but less than the Pro.\nWe've also gotten what seems to be a reliable look at what the color lineup will be for the new smartphones. Macworld reported that the iPhone 17 will be available in black, white, steel gray, green, purple and light blue. The iPhone 17 Air will reportedly have four color options: black, white, light blue and light gold. While the Air colors will be less saturated, the visuals for the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max will go bold. The options for the Pro models are expected to be black, white, gray, dark blue and orange.\nOn July 30, Tom's Guide highlighted an X post from Sonny Dickson — a longtime and generally reliable leaker of unreleased iPhone information — showing \"dummy\" iPhone 17 models in the new colors that were the source of the aforementioned Macworld story. While these are literally just mock-ups — not real, leaked iPhones — it's interesting to see how the design and color rumors translate into a real-world look and feel.\nTo add the the rumors, a Weibo leaker known as Digital Chat Station suggests the iPhone 17e will come equipped with a new design that includes the Dynamic Island, MacRumors reports. According to the post, the new phone will have the A19 chip and could have a 6.1-inch OLED display with a front-facing 12-megapixel camera and a rear-facing 48-megapixel camera. However, it's important to note this report refers to the 17e model that would be expected to launch no earlier than February 2026, if it followed the same release pattern as the iPhone 16e.\nWhat will iOS 26 be like?\nApple upended its numbering conventions with WWDC 2025, and will match the name of each new operating system to the year it's released. So when the next wave of iPhones hits, they'll be running on iOS 26.\nOn the design side, the smartphone OS introduced during the big developer showcase took a contentious approach dubbed Liquid Glass. Apple has been scaling down the amount of transparency effects in the subsequent beta tests of iOS 26, but it will still have a glass-like visual.\nThe feature list includes big and small updates. On the more impactful side, the Phone and Photos apps have been redesigned. There will be several features leveraging artificial intelligence, such as live translation capabilities coming to Phone, FaceTime and Messages. Apple is also currently testing a sensitive content warning for child accounts that will freeze FaceTime video if nudity is detected by on-device machine learning tools. And the company is also launching Visual Intelligence, which will use AI to search for elements in an image.\niOS 26 also has a litany of minor, quality of life improvements. Group texts are getting support for polls. And for the slow risers out there, iOS 26 will finally let you escape the tyranny of the nine minute snooze alarm. \nThe next iOS is now available as a public beta. Here are our initial impressions of the Liquid Glass design and other new features. iOS 26 is compatible with all models back through iPhone 11.\nWhat other products are expected to be released alongside the iPhone 17?\nIf Apple follows its usual pattern, the iPhone 17 will be announced alongside new Apple Watch products. That would be the Apple Watch Series 11 (if Apple sticks to the same naming scheme), and maybe an Apple Watch Ultra 3 and/or an updated Apple Watch SE. (They'll all run watchOS 26, of course.) Other possibilities — and this is, again, speculation — could include refreshed Apple AirPods Pro (which received its last big update in 2022) and maybe new AirTags trackers (first released in 2021).\nThe Apple rumor mill got a big shot in the arm this week thanks to the reported inclusion of product ID numbers in recent beta software builds. Per MacRumors, it's a laundry list of new hardware, including long-rumored product updates like the Apple TV, HomePod mini, new Apple Studio Display monitor and two fresh iPads. \nOf course, even if that list is totally accurate, we may not see those products until 2026 — if ever. So don't expect all of products to share the stage with the iPhone 17, especially since Apple likes to keep its star performer at the center of attention. \nThat said, keep in mind that Apple has recently been having Mac-centric announcements in late October (as it did last year to debut new M4 Macs), so there's always the chance of another shoe dropping a few weeks down the road.  \nUpdate, August 22, 2025: Added new details about the colors of the rumored TechWoven case.\nUpdate, August 20, 2025, 7:12PM ET: Added new rumor about potential TechWoven case for iPhone 17 series.\nUpdate, August 18, 2025, 6:23PM ET: Added new rumor about the iPhone 17e potentially having the Dynamic Island.\nUpdate, August 15, 2025, 2:05PM ET: Added new rumor about the all-aluminum chassis on the iPhone 17.\nUpdate, August 13, 2025, 10:02PM ET: Added a list of the products that are expected to be released alongside the iPhone 17s. \nUpdate, August 11, 2025, 7:27PM ET: Added a render of a rumored new antenna design for the iPhone 17 Pro.\nUpdate, August 8, 2025, 4:43PM ET: Added new speculation and reports about iPhone 17 pricing.\nUpdate, August 6, 2025, 4:05PM ET: Added latest details about the potential iPhone 17 event date.\nUpdate, August 4, 2025, 5:23PM ET: Added latest battery leaks about the iPhone 17 models.\nUpdate, August 1, 2025, 8:15AM ET: Added new photos showing potential iPhone 17 colors.\nUpdate, July 30, 2025, 11:08AM ET: Added latest leaks and rumors about the iPhone 17, and updated information on the iOS 26 public beta.\nUpdate, July 17, 2025, 4:40PM ET: Added latest information about iOS 26, possible materials for the Air, and the color options for the different models.\nUpdate, March 17, 2025, 2PM ET: Added details about the rumored price and features of the iPhone 17 Air.\nUpdate, April 11, 2025, 3:45PM ET: Added details from Front Page Tech's new video that claims to reveal details from a leaked iOS 19 build.\nKatie Teague contributed to this story.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/iphone-17-release-date-ios-26-features-and-everything-else-to-know-about-apples-upcoming-lineup-153024576.html?src=rss",

The leaker noted there are two lanyard holes for \"convenient and secure carrying,\" so it could be worn around your neck. The bigger question is: Will Apple absorb any higher costs, or pass them on to consumers? But years of past precedent show that sometime in September should be when the 17 models make their debut. It may also use Apple's new in-house modem, which was introduced in February on the iPhone 16e. More details about this development may leak ahead of September, but that's what we know for now.

    "summary": "In presumably less than a month, the annual Apple iPhone event will be here, giving us a first look at the iPhone 17 lineup. With that should come the official date for downloading the latest software update, iOS 26. While you wait, you can download and install the newly released public beta 4 (or iOS 26 developer beta 7 for developers). I've been playing around with it for the past couple of weeks, and have found that taking screenshots is way better in the new operating system — Google and ChatGPT search options are now in the screenshots editor, for instance. You can see a more complete view of the new features in our preview of the iOS 26 public beta release, which shows off the fresh home and lock screen redesign. Called Liquid Glass, the translucent look will extend across all of Apple's upcoming operating systems. The overhaul is one of several big changes coming to iOS, macOS, iPadOS and the rest of Apple's software suite, all of which were showcased during the company's WWDC keynote on June 9.\nAfter overpromising on AI plans last year, Apple kept its iOS roadmap focused more on basic quality of life improvements this year. There are multiple useful additions coming to the Phone and Messages apps on your iPhone, for instance: Apple execs outlined the ability to weed out spam texts or other unknown senders and an option to hold your spot on a phone call when you've been waiting for a representative to pick up. Plus, a treasured feature that we took for granted is coming back (hint: it's in the Photos app).\nSiri, meanwhile, is in a holding pattern. Apple has previously specified that its smarter voice assistant — first promised at WWDC 2024 — is delayed until some point \"in the coming year,\" so you shouldn't expect any major changes in the current betas. But there are reports that Apple is aiming to give Siri a bigger brain transplant by basing it on third-party artificial intelligence models like OpenAI's ChatGPT or Anthropic's Claude, which could make 2026 a pivotal year. The company is also reportedly working on a 'stripped-down' AI chatbot to rival ChatGPT.\nWith each beta, it seems like additional new improvements are popping up, like this new AirPods gesture we're all curious about, and this FaceTime feature that'll freeze your video if it detects nudity. With the release of the iOS 26 developer beta 5, we saw more added features, like a new bouncy animation on the passcode screen and in the Control Center, MacRumors reports. Some or all of those changes will likely soon migrate into the separate public beta (see below). Most newer iPhone models are eligible to download iOS 26 (both the betas and final version). Want to see the full list of new features coming this fall? Read on. \nWhat is iOS 26?\nThe current iPhone operating system is iOS 18, and Apple is still actively updating it — version 18.6.1 was released to restore Apple Watch blood oxygen monitoring functionality for certain users in the US. More recently, Apple released 18.6.2 to address a vulnerability related to image processing. Apple has officially stopped signing iOS 18.6, MacRumors reports, which means it can no longer be installed on your iPhone due to a \"server-side software verification check.\" That's pretty normal when newer versions are available to download.\nBut don't expect to see iOS 19 soon — or ever. Instead, Apple is skipping the numbering ahead to iOS 26 later this year. The company has decided to line up its iOS version numbers with a year-based system, similar to car model years. So while iOS and its sibling operating systems will be released in late 2025, they're all designated \"26\" to reflect the year ahead. \nIt's official, we're moving to iOS 26. (Apple)\nWhat is Liquid Glass design?\nLet's be honest. Out of everything announced at WWDC this year, the new Liquid Glass design was the star of the show. The iPhone's home and lock screens have looked pretty much the same year after year — the last exciting thing (in my opinion) was the option to add your own aesthetic to your home screen by customizing your apps and widgets. So seeing the home and lock screens' new facelift is refreshing.\nSo what exactly is Liquid Glass? Apple calls it a \"new translucent material\" since, well, the apps and widgets are clear. However, the screen can still adapt to dark and light modes, depending on surroundings. You'll also notice buttons with a new floating design in several apps, like Phone and Maps. They're designed to be less distracting than the current buttons, but are still easy to see. While the design overhaul has proven to be controversial since its announcement, some — including Engadget's own Devindra Hardawar — like the new direction, even if it's somewhat reminiscent of Microsoft's translucent Windows Vista Aero designs from nearly twenty years ago.\nThat said, as of the release of the iOS 26 beta 2, Apple has already incorporated some user feedback into the design, dialing back the transparency in at least some places. And while it will continue to evolve, Apple users won't be able to escape it: Liquid Glass was designed to make all of Apple's OSes more cohesive. Here's a look at how the translucent aesthetic will look with the new macOS Tahoe 26 on your desktop.\nWhat are the new and notable features of iOS 26?\niOS 26 has a laundry list of new features. Among the most worthwhile:\nPhone app redesign: You'll finally be able to scroll through contacts, recent calls and voicemail messages all on one screen. It also comes with a new feature called Hold Assist that'll notify you when an agent comes to the phone so you can avoid the elevator music and continue on with other tasks.\nLive Translation in Phone, FaceTime and Messages: iOS 26 is bringing the ability to have a conversation via phone call or text message with someone who speaks another language. Live Translation will translate your conversation in real time, which results in some stop-and-go interactions in the examples Apple shared during its presentation.\nPolls in group chats: Tired of sorting through what seems like hundreds of messages in your group chat? You and your friends will soon be able to create polls in group messages for deciding things like which brunch spot you're eating at or whose car you're taking on a road trip.\nFiltering unknown senders in Messages: If you haven't received spam texts about unpaid tolls or other citations, you're lucky. For those of us who have, those annoying messages will soon be filtered away in a separate folder.\nVisual Intelligence: Similar to a reverse Google image search, this new feature will allow you to search for anything that's on your iPhone screen. For instance, if you spot a pair of shoes someone is wearing in an Instagram photo, you can screenshot it and use Visual Intelligence to find those shoes (or similar ones) online.\nPhotos tabs are back: For anyone who's still frustrated with the Photos changes made last year, you'll be happy to know that your tabs are coming back. Library and Collections will have their own separate spaces so you don't have to scroll to infinity to find what you're looking for.\nFaceTime \"Communication Safety\" feature: A newer addition to iOS 26 appears to be the FaceTime \"Communication Safety\" feature that pauses communications if and when nudity is detected. The feature appears to be a child safety feature that uses on-device detection, thus obviating any cloud-based privacy issues. \nNew lock screen options: The iPhone lock screen gets more customizable in iOS 26, with a cooler clock, 3D wallpaper effects, more widgets and better focus mode options. \nApple's Hold Assist will be nifty for those pesky services that put you on hold for 10 or more minutes. (Apple)\nNew changes coming to iPadOS 26\nYour iPad isn't getting left behind when it comes to big updates. Here's what's coming this fall.\nMultitasking and real windowing: When you download the newest update, you'll be able to have multiple apps running on your screen at the same time. Once you open an app, it'll appear on your screen as normal but you'll be able to resize and move it across your screen to make room for other apps. This feature is optional so you can turn it off if you don't like it.\nVisual update: Along with the other new OSes, iPadOS 26 is coming with the Liquid Glass aesthetic. This new look will appear on the lock and home screens, as well as the drop-down menus.\nNew menu bar: When you swipe down on your screen, the new menu bar will appear with options like File, Edit, Windows and more. There's also a search option if you're looking for something specific.\nCheck out our first impressions of iPadOS 26. \nWhat about AirPods?\nAirPods are also getting updated with iOS 26. Here are some of the more notable functions.\nEnhanced audio recording: Apple calls this \"studio-quality\" audio recording, and with it, you'll notice more clarity while in noisy environments.\nCamera remote control: Using this, you can take a photo or start and stop video recording with just one press on your AirPods. When taking photos, you'll get a three-second countdown before your iPhone or iPad snaps the picture.\nLive translation feature: While not officially announced or confirmed, it appears that the long-rumored live translation for AirPods could be coming with iOS 26. The evidence comes from a system asset spotted in the in iOS 26 beta showing a gesture that's triggered by pressing both earbud stems at the same time. The photo also shows words in several different languages. \nWhich iPhones will be able to upgrade to iOS 26?\nA few iPhone models that run the current version of iOS — iPhone XR, XS and XS Max — won't be compatible with the latest upgrade. But any iPhones released in 2019 or later will be eligible for the iOS 26 update.\n\niPhone SE (second generation or later)\niPhone 11\niPhone 11 Pro\niPhone 11 Pro Max\niPhone 12\niPhone 12 mini\niPhone 12 Pro\niPhone 12 Pro Max\niPhone 13\niPhone 13 mini\niPhone 13 Pro\niPhone 13 Pro Max\niPhone 14\niPhone 14 Plus\niPhone 14 Pro\niPhone 14 Pro Max\niPhone 15\niPhone 15 Plus\niPhone 15 Pro\niPhone 15 Pro Max\niPhone 16\niPhone 16 Plus\niPhone 16 Pro\niPhone 16 Pro Max\niPhone 16e\n\nNot listed here are the presumed new iPhone 17 models (or maybe iPhone 26?) that are all but certain to be announced and released in September. \nHow to install iOS 26 beta\nThe iOS 26 public beta is now available to download via the Apple Beta Software Program. If you're not already a member, you'll need to sign up to try out all the latest features. Just visit beta.apple.com and sign up with your phone number or email address. It's free.\nOnce you're in, you can install it by going to Settings > General > Software Update and selecting iOS 26 public beta. \nA word of caution: Don't sign up with your main iPhone unless you're OK with any risks that occur with using an OS that isn't finalized.\nWhen will the final version of iOS 26 be released?\niOS 26 will be released to the public this fall. It usually comes in September, within a week of the Apple iPhone event. Last year, it rolled out to iPhone users on September 16 — exactly one week after the iPhone 16 lineup was announced.\nIf you're more interested in the Apple Intelligence features coming, here's everything Apple revealed for iOS, macOS and more during WWDC.

The company says these changes will help protect X’s platform from “spam, bots, and manipulative activities” that degrade the user experience.

When its new API pricing arrived in spring 2023, it was clear the company had revenue generation in mind, as its most bare-bones, basic plan would do little more than support those that were offering “good bots” — that is, automated accounts that provided useful information, like weather alerts.

    "summary": "Ubisoft still isn’t giving us a new Splinter Cell game, but Sam Fisher fans are at least getting an animated TV adaptation very soon. At this week’s Anime NYC convention, Netflix revealed a new teaser trailer for the upcoming Splinter Cell: Deathwatch and confirmed that the series will come to the service on October 14.\nWritten by John Wick creator Derek Kolstad and starring Liev Schreiber as an older — but still decidedly badass — Sam Fisher, Splinter Cell: Deathwatch was first announced back in 2020, but we hadn’t learned much more until now. In the brief trailer, we see the National Security Agency’s most reliable stealth operative doing a fair bit of his trademark sneaking around in the shadows, after returning to the field for what he calls a \"personal\" mission. I also quite like how liberally the iconic Splinter Cell night vision goggles sound is used in the trailer.\n\nThe voice cast also includes The Sandman’s Kirby Howell-Baptise as Zinnia McKenna, an original character, and Janet Garvey as Anna Grimsdottir, a fellow agent who provided tech support to Fisher in the Splinter Cell games. The trailer itself doesn’t give much away about the plot, but we do see the grave of Douglas Shetland, a close friend of Fisher who he was ordered to eliminate in fan favorite game entry, Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory.\nUbisoft is doing some interesting things in the adult animation space. The completely bonkers Captain Laserhawk: A Blood Dragon Remix reimagined Rayman as a foul-mouthed TV host and is littered with deep cut Ubisoft references. And somewhat inevitably, an animated Assassin’s Creed show is also currently in development, though we don’t have a date for that one yet.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/netflixs-splinter-cell-deathwatch-animated-series-arrives-on-october-14-145632934.html?src=rss",

    "full_text": "In Brief A former software developer has been sentenced to four years in prison for sabotaging his former employer’s network after leaving the company. Davis Lu, 55, was convicted of installing a “kill switch” on the network of his former employer by planting malicious code designed to crash its servers in the event that he was fired. The kill switch was activated when the company terminated Lu’s employment and deactivated his credentials, causing the kill switch, “IsDLEnabledinAD” — referring to whether Lu’s account was still active in the company’s Active Directory. The incident locked out thousands of employees from accessing the company’s systems. The Justice Department, which prosecuted the case, said Lu’s employer, which was not named but reportedly was the power tech company Eaton, said the incident caused hundreds of thousands of dollars in damage. Lu was discovered in part through his internet search history, the Justice Department said, which included searches researching “methods to escalate privileges, hide processes, and rapidly delete files.” We’re always looking to evolve, and by providing some insight into your perspective and feedback into TechCrunch and our coverage and events, you can help us!

The company told TechCrunch it plans to start testing “immediately.” Waymo’s vehicles must have a trained safety operator in the driver’s seat, with at least one hand on the wheel at all times. The company cannot pick up passengers (since it would need a license from the city’s Taxi and Limousine Commission) and it has to regularly meet with and report data to the city’s Department of Transportation (DOT), according to the mayor’s office. The permit brings Waymo one step closer to launching a robotaxi service in the city, which would be arguably its most challenging to date. Waymo has spent years poking at the Big Apple, starting in 2021 when it used its Chrysler Pacifica minivans to manually map the city. The company applied in June, and has spent the last few months meeting with lawmakers and local organizations like Mothers Against Drunk Driving. The permit is part of a new autonomous vehicle safety regime launched by Mayor Eric Adams in 2024. When Waymo’s trial period ends in late September, it will have to apply for an extension if it wants to keep testing.

This model comes with 16GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD. You can upgrade to 512GB SSD for $999, down from $1,199, another all-time low price, or 24GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD for $1,199, down from $1,399. \n \nThen there's the 15-inch MacBook Air M4, whose cheapest model is on sale for $999, dropping from $1,199. The 17 percent discount is the best deal we've seen since the pair debuted in March. As with the 13-inch model, the 16GB and 512GB SSD option is also a record-low price, dropping to $1,199 from $1,399. Then there's the 24GB upgrade, which is $1,399, down from $1,599.\nWe're big fans of the MacBook Air M4, giving it a 92 in our review. Part of that comes from an already lower starting price for the MacBooks than their predecessors. The 2025 models also get a speed boost thanks to the M4 chip and are very thin with a 0.44-inch thickness. Neither the 13- or 15-inch will drag you down, weighing 2.7 pounds and 3.2 pounds, respectively. Plus, they both have excellent battery life, lasting over 18 hours while playing an HD video. \nThe big differences in the 15-inch model mostly come down to size. The screen is obviously bigger, as is its trackpad. Other than that, it offers better speakers than its 13-inch sibling. \n \nCheck out our coverage of the best Apple deals for more discounts, and follow @EngadgetDeals on X for the latest tech deals and buying advice.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/apples-macbook-air-m4-drops-to-a-record-low-price-123031057.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "NVIDIA has reportedly asked its suppliers to halt production related to its H20 AI chips for the Chinese market. According to The Information, the company told Arizona-based Amkor Technology and Samsung Electronics to put a pause on their work for the H20. Amkor produces advanced packaging for the H20 chips, while Samsung supplies memory for NVIDIA. Reuters has also reported that NVIDIA asked Foxconn, which is in charge of backend processing for the chip, to suspend its work. \"We constantly manage our supply chain to address market condition,\" the company told CNBC in a statement when asked to comment about the supposed production pause. \nThe US government had blocked NVIDIA from selling the H20 in China back in April, out of concerns that the country could use it to develop AI tech for its military. It allowed the company to resume selling the chip in China by July, reportedly after closing a deal that would give it 15 percent of the sales. But China didn't welcome the H20 with open arms. Local regulators instructed the biggest Chinese tech companies, including ByteDance and Alibaba to stop new orders for H20 chips, citing security concerns. The Cyberspace Administration of China talked to NVIDIA, claiming that AI experts had revealed that the chips could be tracked and controlled remotely. NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang had admitted that Chinese regulators asked him about the supposed \"backdoor\" and said that he made it clear it didn't exist. \"Hopefully the response that we've given to the Chinese government will be sufficient,\" Huang said. \nA recent report by the Financial Times, however, claimed that Chinese authorities didn't issue warnings against using NVIDIA chips just because of security concerns. Apparently, they found certain remarks by US commerce secretary Howard Lutnick \"insulting.\" When the US allowed shipments of the H20 to China again, Lutnick said during an interview: \"We don't sell them our best stuff, not our second best stuff, not even our third best. The fourth one down, we want to keep China using it...  You want to sell the Chinese enough that their developers get addicted to the American technology stack.\"\nThe H20 is currently the most advanced AI chip NVIDIA can sell in the Chinese market, but the company is reportedly developing a more powerful product. It will be based on the company's Blackwell architecture, Reuters previously reported, and will be capable of half the computing power of NVIDIA's Blackwell Ultra GPUs.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/nvidia-reportedly-stops-production-of-h20-ai-chips-133020132.html?src=rss",

I’m typically skeptical of the current generation of AI, but as I checked out the new software across various demo sessions, I found myself more and more intrigued. It seems like Google, along with Apple and Samsung, has been working on making these AI-powered updates more helpful in a way that might actually make our lives easier or simply more fun.\nThere wasn’t enough time to write up every single one of them, so I’ve put a few of my favorites in this story to give you a better sense of what to expect when the Pixel 10 series hits retail shelves later this month. Spoiler alert: Many of these have to do with voice and calls — an area Google has historically excelled at.\nThe Recorder app can generate backing music\nI have long been enamored with Google’s Recorder app. It started with the on-device transcription that made getting quotes from my interviews easy and relatively secure. But when Apple introduced a multi-track recording function to its Voice Memos app, I quickly jumped ship. While the iOS recorder has inferior transcription in terms of accuracy and readability, the fact that I could basically record a duet with myself seriously appealed to the musical theater geek in me. I played both Elphaba and Glinda, crooning their parts from “For Good” into my iPhone.\nBut when Google’s senior director of product management for Pixel software Shenaz Zack told me the Pixel 10’s recorder app would add AI-generated music to your singing, I went silent in slight disbelief. I spent much of my youth ripping karaoke tracks from YouTube videos, looking up “minus one” or “backing tracks” or “instrumentals only” on various download platforms. My friends and I were aspiring performers, looking to mix our own covers of popular songs, and a tool that would generate backing music to our voice tracks would have been a dream come true. Honestly it kind of still is.\nZack walked me through the process twice — on my first try I sang a verse and part of the chorus of “Golden” from the Kpop Demon Hunters soundtrack. I giggled self-consciously at the end, before Zack hit stop. As it recorded, the app actually showed a tag that indicated it knew I was singing, and when we selected the recording after, a chip appeared saying “Create and add music.”\nTapping that brought up a panel titled “Choose a vibe to create music” with two sections: Featured vibes and Your vibes. Under the first one, the options were “Chill beats,” “Cozy,” “Dance party,” “Rainy day blues,” “Romantic” and “Surprise me.” On my second attempt, when I rushed through a rendition of the all-time banger “Mary Had a Little Lamb,” the app displayed a warning at the bottom that said “The beat might not match well if the recording is short.”\nI chose Dance Party, hit next, and waited a minute or so while Recorder went to work. The animation at the top said the system was analyzing the audio, identifying the rhythm, locking onto the beat and harmonizing the track before delivering the result.\nI don’t quite know what I was expecting, but I can say that those who were at all concerned about digital rights management have nothing to worry about. The music that Google generated for “Golden” sounded nothing like the original, and while it did make my voice sound less lonely and made for a more complete track, I felt like I needed a few more adjustments to feel satisfied with it. As for “Mary Had a Little Lamb,” the result was as generic as expected for an AI-generated soundtrack to a very basic nursery rhyme.\nTo Google’s credit, what came out seemed to be in the right key and rhythm, and I certainly will need much more time playing around with this to see if tweaking the settings will help. I also wanted to point out that the generated music also stopped as my singing stopped, so the giggling I mentioned earlier was not scored.\nAlthough this feature did not live up to my (admittedly unrealistic) fantasy, I do think it’s a fun use of AI and seems harmless. It’s not going to be a mainstay of most people’s daily routines, although Zack did say that a large percent of people actually used Recorder for singing. This update could certainly make for a nice little dose of musical creativity.\n        View this post on Instagram            A post shared by Engadget (@engadget)\n\nVoice Translate made it sound like I was speaking German\nI had more concerns around the Voice Translate feature that was supposed to make you or your caller sound like you were speaking in a different language. According to Google, the goal is to “break down language barriers during phone calls.” When I asked Zack why the company felt the need to make the voice resemble the caller’s, she said it was about personal connection.\nZack explained that her parents live in India, and though they speak English, they’re not very fluent. That makes for some difficulty when they call Zack’s kids. Simply adding a robotic voice that’s translating between the grandparents and the children wouldn’t feel right, either. I was initially skeptical that fully replacing the caller’s original voice with a translated version would help, but after a few demos, I am certainly swayed.\nTo be clear, the person placing the call has to do so from a Pixel phone for Voice Translate to work. Once you choose Voice Translate from the Call Assist submenu, you’ll have to choose a language. When the call is connected, the system will say to both parties that the “Call is translated by Google AI in each speaker’s voice. Audio is not saved.”\nI tried this out a few times with a Google representative who spoke German, whom we will refer to as “Uncle Tim” to make it easier for me to describe this demo. Each time he spoke, I could hear a couple seconds of his voice in German, before a chime played and the version in the original language became softer. What sounded like a dubbed actor playing Uncle Tim came on and conversed in English, complete with realistic replications of pitch, rhythm and expression.\nI also could hear feedback when I talked on the call, so I heard myself speaking German on the other end. It was truly strange, because it sort of did sound like me. One of my closest friends lives in Germany, and has had to put up with my attempts to learn German for more than 10 years. I immediately wanted to try Voice Translate on her to see if she would believe I had suddenly become fluent (but of course, I’d have to figure out how to get her to ignore the warnings that Google AI was at work).\nI’ll be honest, the experience wasn’t perfect. Not only were the translations sometimes off (some of what Uncle Tim said in English didn’t make sense), the generated voices seemed less like a complete replication of the caller and more like a novice dubbing artist. That’s not a bad thing, since I was very concerned about impersonation being a problem.\nTo that end, Zack said Google was deliberate about the implementation. She reminded me of the “ducking” that was in place, which is when the original speech is still audible in the first few seconds and then softer throughout. Like the original audio is ducking below the dubbed voice — get it? And I remembered that while the AI voice might sound sort of like me, it isn’t designed to simply make up things I’m saying — it’s just translating the content. I’m the one that decides whether to go off and curse out a relative and have that conveyed in their native tongue, for example.\nOf course, there may still be bugs and quirks to work out. I was amused by the various accents that came through in the English-speaking version of Uncle Tim. At first he sounded American, but in subsequent conversations he took on an Australian accent.\nAll this is powered by the Pixel 10’s Tensor G5 chip and processed on-device using “a new codec and semantic understanding,” according to Zack, to understand the speaker’s vocal expressions. For now, I see what Google is going for and cannot wait to call my friend in Frankfurt.\nAt launch, Voice Translate will support translating to or from English with Spanish, German, Japanese, French, Hindi, Italian, Portuguese, Swedish, Russian and Indonesian.\nGoogle/Screenshot by Engadget\nMagic Cue surfacing your flight info when you call your airline is helpful\nThe recorder app, translation and expressive-sounding AI are areas Google has long proven expertise in. And lest we forget, the company has also been a pioneer in suggesting actions from your emails and adding events to your calendar by scanning your inbox. With the Pixel 10’s Magic Cue feature, Google is basically bringing this functionality to your texts and calls.\nWhile Magic Cue can helpfully show shortcuts within the Messages app to help you answer questions about reservations or send photos from recent trips, I’m most into one specific aspect. When you call an airline to make changes to a flight, for instance, the Pixel 10 can pull up your reservation information and display it within the call, so you won’t have to open your email, and search for the booking confirmation to have your reference number ready. Sure, it might only save you seconds, but it’s so much easier, and Google already does a version of this in your inbox.\nI would love to see this particular feature expand and cover other types of appointments so you can quickly get codes or other identifying information during calls to, say, your plumber, doctor, insurance provider and more.\nCamera and photo features continue to improve\nGoogle continues to improve upon areas it’s led the way in, and photography remains a strength of Pixel phones. The company was one of the first major players to use its algorithmic prowess to dramatically improve the quality of low light photos and with the Pixel 10 Pro it again uses computational processing to deliver superior images.\nPro Res Zoom on the new phone did manage to produce some surprisingly clean pictures of faraway buildings, at least in my demo at Google’s Manhattan office. I was impressed by how clear the lines on the underside of a skyscraper that we zoomed to a 100x level on looked. Google was also careful to clarify that Pro Res Zoom won’t work on people, and that distant text may look odd. \n\"We've tuned Pro Res Zoom to minimize hallucinations, however they may still occur — especially with faraway text. Additionally, when Pro Res Zoom detects a person in the scene, we use a different enhancement algorithm that prevents inaccurate representations,\" according to Google.\nIn those situations, the algorithm will drop to Super Res Zoom quality. Depending on which Pixel phone you’re using, Super Res Zoom delivers up to either 20x or 30x zoom.\nIn the results I saw, people standing on a deck at the top of a tower just seemed a bit pixelated compared to the building’s facade, and the effect wasn’t jarring or even really noticeable until I zoomed in. But that might be because they were a tiny part of the picture — I imagine things would look different if a person was the main subject in a scene.\nAs someone who enjoys composing pictures, I didn’t think the Camera Coach feature would do anything for me. But I was pleasantly surprised that I actually liked some of the AI’s proposed framing options. I still don’t think I’ll use this much in the real world, but it might help other people who want tips on photography.\n\nI was initially nonplussed about the new Photos feature that lets you tell the AI how to edit your pictures, but after a brief demo I came around. Simply telling Gemini to “turn that red dress blue” or “get rid of the people in the background” was not only easier, but suprrisingly effective. I also want to point out that Google also made tweaks to the Guided Frame feature in its camera app that helps those who are blind or visually impaired know what is in the scene. It now uses Gemini models, which should help with object recognition.\nFinally, it’s worth calling out the support for C2PA content authenticity initiative. Google is building this into the Photos app, where metadata will show whether or not AI was used in a picture. The Pixel 10 phones will be the first to implement the new industry-standard Content Credentials (CR) within its native camera app, and companies like Adobe, Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft, OpenAI are all part of the initiative. \nAn assortment of other updates worthy of mention\nThose were just a slice of the new AI-related features I was impressed by at my recent demos ahead of Google’s event this week. But there are quite a few more I found promising, like visual overlays in Gemini Live and the new Pixel Journal app. I didn’t spend as much time with either, but they worked in my brief demos. So did the “take a message” feature that will send transcriptions of voicemails to you, which seems like a much better way to be alerted to a missed call than a hidden section of the Phone app.\nI’m not yet sold on the Daily Hub, which is basically an updated version of the existing pages that sit to the left of the home page showing relevant actions and articles you might want to explore. I’m fairly intentional when it comes to looking for things to consume, and have specific apps I prefer for doomscrolling (Reddit over everything), so I’m not sure Daily Hub will suit me.\nStill, the fact that I liked the bulk of the new AI features coming to the Pixel 10 series is pretty significant. Of course, I will still reserve judgement until I can spend more time with them in the real world, and hope to write reviews of some of them. But it’s clear from my time with demos of the Pixel 10 that Google has been pretty thoughtful about how it imbues its hardware with AI, and I hope its competitors take notes.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/my-favorite-google-ai-features-from-the-pixel-10-launch-130023979.html?src=rss",

Companies like TSMC and Micron that increased their US investments won't have any additional obligations, according to a government official familiar with the matter.\nEalier, commerce secretary Howard Lutnick appeared to royally screw NVIDIA with comments about the company's H20 AI chips, and may have also rubbed chip giant TSMC the wrong way. \"The Biden administration literally was giving Intel [money] for free, and giving TSMC money for free, and all these companies, just giving them money for free,\" he told CNBC on Tuesday. \"Donald Trump turns that into saying, 'Hey, we want equity for the money. If we’re going to give you the money, we want a piece of the action.'\"\nHowever, TSMC may have noticed the Intel equity kerfuffle and executives reportedly held preliminary discussions about handing back subsidies if the US government asks to become a shareholder, according to the WSJ's sources. TSMC was awarded $6.6 billion for its Arizona plant that started producing chips late last year for Apple and others. However, the company recently said it would invest another $100 billion over the next four years to build three more fabrication plants, two advanced packaging facilities and a major research and development center. \nBecause of that extra investment, the Trump administration won't ask for a piece of TSMC or Micron (which also expanded its US facilities in Idaho, New York and Virginia). \"The Commerce Department is not looking to take equity from TSMC and Micron,\" an unnamed official said. \nIn any case, attempts by the US government to take equity in companies will likely face legal challenges due to language in the contracts. Companies are already required to share revenue with the US government if profits rise above a certain amount. \nIn another development, the US government may divert up to $2 billion in CHIPS Act funding toward critical minerals projects in the US, Reuters reported. The move aims to reduce US dependence on China for key minerals extensively used in the electronics and defense industries. \"The administration is creatively trying to find ways to fund the critical minerals sector,\" Reuters' source said, adding that those plans could change. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/trump-administration-official-says-some-chips-act-companies-wont-need-to-give-up-equity-130041299.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "After testing around a dozen ereaders, we think the best bet for most people is the Kobo Clara Colour. But the base-model Kindle is also good, offering a cheap and easy entry point into ebooks. And Boox makes a few E Ink readers that do more than just display books. Now that most ereader companies also offer color models, the field is wider than ever. In short, there are a few things to consider before buying your next (or first) ereader and this guide covers product recommendations alongside advice on how to get the most out of your new device.\nTable of contents\n\nBest ereaders\nWhat to look for in an ereader\nHow to get books for your ereader\nHow we test ereaders\nEreader FAQs\nRecent updates\n\nThe best ebook readers for 2025\n \n  \n \n \n\n \n \n \nWhat to look for in an ereader\nPlenty of apps, including the Kindle app, will let you download and read digital books on an iPhone, Android Phone or tablet. But what makes ebook readers different is the screen: nearly all of them use technology from a company called E Ink. It manufactures electronic paper displays (EPD) composed of three sheets: one containing millions of microcapsules filled with black and white ink particles sandwiched between transparent electrode layers. When a charge is applied, either the black or white particles shift to the top, forming letters and the whitespace around them. \nColor ereaders add a color filter array on top of the standard black and white microcapsule layer. The result is two different resolutions on one screen — the color clarity is 150 dpi while black and white images and text are still 300 dpi.\nBecause these displays are so different from standard backlight LED panels, you can expect most good ereaders to do a number of things well. They’ll be easier to stare at for long periods of time and easier to read in direct sunlight. Also, since E Ink displays only require power to rearrange the ink, these devices have much longer battery lives than even the best tablets: we’re talking weeks on a single charge, not days.\nThe ereader market is not as saturated as, say, the smartphone market, but there are still plenty of options out there and they do have small but important differences among them. They tend to range from around $100 to more than $400, though usually the higher end options are stylus-enabled read/write E Ink tablets like the Kindle Scribe. Beyond price, you should consider physical properties like buttons, lights, storage and resolution, as well as how the software lets you find and access books.\nReading features\nWith any ereader, you’ll navigate the OS via taps and swipes, and some add physical page-turn buttons. Most with built-in buttons have an auto-rotating screen so you can press with your right or left hand.\nAs E Ink technology has advanced, resolution has greatly improved – even the budget Kindle ereader has a 300 ppi display. You can still find models with lower resolution, but we don’t recommend them.\nSome ereaders have front LEDs that support light temperature adjustment. That means you can switch to a warmer light after the sun goes down, which will feel easier on the eyes. If you’re concerned about blue light, you should go for a reader with that feature. Finally, dark mode is available on most later model ereaders, allowing you to invert the black and white text and background, which some people find easier to read in low-light settings. \nOther features\nThe capabilities of these pocket libraries have advanced considerably since the early days. In addition to storing books, some let you browse the web, run apps and play music. The screen’s frame rate can’t handle gaming, but it’s good enough to show you the Wikipedia entry for Striver’s Row while you read Crook Manifesto.\nIf you listen to audiobooks, you may want a Bluetooth-enabled ereader capable of playing them. Most of the models we tested have that ability, with the notable exception of the Nook ereader we tried. Keep in mind that audiobook files can take up more space than print files so you'll probably want a device with a higher storage capacity if you plan on doing a lot of listening.\nAbove all, you should consider where and how you intend to find books to read. Most ereaders make it easiest to shop through their own digital bookstores, but all of them (even Kindles) will now let you download titles from other sources, like libraries, unaffiliated ebook sellers and free public domain sites.\n\n\n\n\n   Photo by Amy Skorheim / Engadget \n \n\nHow to get books for your ereader\nKindle, Nook and Kobo all have their own stores that you access directly from each brand’s devices. Prices are the same among all sellers, too. Publishers set the price of an ebook, not the retailer, so a title will cost the same at Amazon, Barnes & Noble, eBooks.com and the Kobo store.\nAmazon offers Kindle Unlimited for $12 per month, and it includes four million titles from which you can pick your next read. It includes audio and ebooks, but you won’t find many big, new releases or older bestsellers. Kobo has a subscription called Kobo Plus with about 1.3 million titles: it goes for $8 per month for ebooks only, $8 for audiobooks only or $10 for both.\nBuying a book from a proprietary store instantly delivers it to your device, provided you’re connected to WiFi. It also syncs your reading across devices and apps, so you can pick up where you left off on your phone if you forgot your ereader at home. It truly is the most convenient way to go, but if you don’t want to be locked into one brand’s store, or if you opt for an ereader without its own marketplace, you do have options.\nHow to upload ePubs onto an ereader\nStores like ebooks.com and Google Play have millions of ebooks for sale as digital rights-managed (DRM) ePub files, which Kobo, Nook and PocketBook readers can read in their native ereader apps. Kindles don’t support DRM ePub files at all and Boox devices require third party reading apps (of which there are many) to read those files. Titles from Apple Books are only readable in iOS devices. \nTitles from some publishers like Tor and public domain classics from sites like Project Gutenberg are also sold as ePubs, but without the added DRM. Consequently, Kindles and the Boox Neoreader do support those files. Books you get from third-party sources will look just like ones you bought from a proprietary store, thanks to the flowable, formatted nature of ePub files. While these device-agnostic ebook collections give you extra options for finding your next read, they require a few additional steps to get the files onto your ereader.\nTo do so, you’ll typically need a computer running a free program called Adobe Digital Editions (ADE). After buying and downloading the ePub file, open ADE and plug your ereader into your computer (all readers here have a USB-C port for charging and data transfers). Your device should pop up in the left panel. Drag and drop the ePub file from your downloads folder into the main panel in ADE. The file will display as an image of the book cover. Drag that image onto your device on the left panel. If the file includes digital rights management (which protects against unauthorized copying) you’ll need to authorize your ereader, which requires using or creating a free Adobe ID. Once you’ve finished adding files to upload, eject the reader from your computer to complete the transfer process.\nKindles use a web-based uploader instead of the ADE method. But since Kindle uses its own proprietary DRM technology instead of Adobe's, the only files it can accept from third parties are non-DRM files, such as from Tor Publishing or Project Gutenberg. After downloading a compatible ePub file, drag and drop it into your browser with the Send to Kindle page open. As long as you’re signed into Amazon, this wirelessly transfers the files to your associated device.\nBoox also uses a browser uploader called BooxDrop (along with many other methods) to deliver ePubs to the device. Open it from the Boox App menu and you’ll see a device-specific url. Type that into your browser to access a file delivery portal that uploads to your library. Boox’s built-in ereader app, NeoReader, also doesn’t support files with DRM, so you won’t be able to read current titles from most publishers using that app. Fortunately, Boox devices run nearly every ereader app out there, Kobo and Kindle included, letting you access ePubs any number of ways.\nRecently, Bookshop.org, the online seller of physical books that supports indie bookstores, started selling ebooks and up to 100 percent of the profits will go to local booksellers. The company uses a different rights management system than ADE so, right now, you can only read titles you buy from them on the Bookshop.org app, but the company is working with the makers of both Kindle and Kobo to extend compatibility to those ereaders.\nHow to read library books on an ereader\nYour local library card lets you borrow audio and ebooks through a program called Overdrive and its companion app Libby. On a Kobo, you have have built-in access to Overdrive in a separate tab. Once you’ve linked your public library card, the search function will include results for titles available from your local library system; a few taps will upload your selections to your device for the length of the loan. I personally find it easiest to borrow the title I want through the Libby app on my phone. After that, the book pops up on my Kobo’s home screen once the device syncs.\nTo read library books on a Kindle, you can either go through the Libby app or the Overdrive section of your library’s website. Once you click Borrow, you’ll see the option to “Read now with Kindle,” which takes you to Amazon’s site to sign in. After that, the book will be delivered to your device the next time it connects to WiFi.\nFor other ereaders, you’ll go through your library’s Overdrive portal and download the ePub after clicking the Borrow button. You can then use the ADE process we described above. Devices that run external apps, like Boox's Page, Go Color 7 or Palma, allow you to read library books via the Libby app, just as you would on a smartphone or iPad.\nYou can also use the Libby app to borrow audiobooks, but you won’t be able to access them through your ereader. (The exception is an ereader, like a Boox device, that allows external apps). I found it was easier to listen to an audiobook on my phone anyway, regardless of whether I borrowed it through Libby or bought it from Kindle or Kobo.\n\n\n\n\n   Photo by Amy Skorheim / Engadget \n \n\nHow we test ereaders\nWhen putting together any guide, the first thing we do is spend hours researching the field. We look at what’s available, what’s new, and what shoppers and professional reviewers have to say. Then we narrow a list to the best candidates for hands-on testing.\nOver the course of the past two years, I’ve tested just over a dozen ereaders, representing five different brands: Amazon, Kobo, Barnes & Noble, Boox and PocketBook. I bought, borrowed and uploaded books for each device using the methods above. I used each one for between a few days to a few months. I evaluated each one in the areas of book access, ease of reading, extra features and overall value. Here’s everything we tested so far:\n\nAmazon Kindle (2022)\nAmazon Kindle (2024)\nAmazon Kindle Paperwhite (2021)\nAmazon Kindle Paperwhite Signature (2024)\nBoox Go Color 7 \nBoox Leaf 2\nBoox Page\nBoox Poke 5\nBoox Palma\nKobo Libra 2\nKobo Libra Colour\nKobo Clara 2E\nKobo Clara Colour\nKobo Nia\nNOOK GlowLight 4 \nPocketBook Era\n\nOther ereaders we tested\nAmazon Kindle Colorsoft\nAmazon’s first color Kindle impressed with its quick page-turns and load times, auto-adjusting front light and, of course, a decently striking color E Ink display. But at $280, it’s more expensive than all of the other color ereaders in its size range, including the Kobo Libra Colour and the Boox Go Color 7.\nAlso, some Colorsoft owners reported seeing a yellow band at the bottom of their ereader’s display. This issue did not affect our first review unit during the original testing period, but it eventually appeared. An Amazon spokesperson told Engadget: \"A small number of customers have reported a yellow band along the bottom of the display. We take the quality of our products seriously—customers who notice this can reach out to our customer service team for a replacement or refund, and we’re making the appropriate adjustments to ensure that new devices will not experience this issue moving forward.\"\nAmazon sent us a new Colorsoft ereader at the end of 2024 and it does appear that the fixes the company made resolved the yellow-band issue. The screen on our second review unit appears warmer overall, but not overly so. It’s more akin to the screen on the Kobo Libra Colour, and that’s a good thing.\nBoox Go 7 stylus-enabled ereader\nBoox recently released two new stylus-enabled generations of their seven-inch reader: The monochrome Go 7 and a color-screen Go Color 7 (Gen II). After trying out the stylus-enabled Go 7, I still like the standard, non-stylus enabled version better. True, I liked the Notebook app with its array of handwriting templates and I appreciated the low-to-no latency with the stylus. It also offers a good assortment of brush, pen and style options. But outside of the Notebook app, I didn’t find much use for the stylus.\nI was able to doodle in the margins of DRM-free books in Boox’s native NeoReader, but it doesn’t work in other apps or on any rights-managed books. There's a FreeMark option that allows you to draw or write atop any app, but it saves your doodles as separate images, as opposed to allowing you to mark up the page itself. I also found enabling the stylus to be a little glitchy. If you plan to do a lot of writing, you’ll probably be better served by an E Ink tablet, but if you want an ereader that can mark up your books, I suggest going with the Kobo Libra Color, detailed above.\nEreader FAQs\nWhat's the difference between an ereader and an e-ink reader?\nReally, they are the same thing. E Ink is a company that designs and manufactures the paper-like screens found in most ereader devices. Technically, anything you read ebooks on can act as an ereader, so your phone, iPad or Android tablet could all serve that purpose, but they’re not considered dedicated ereaders. While there are some devices marketed as ereaders that have LCD or OLED screens instead of E Ink, they aren’t as common. One of the benefits of ereaders is the E Ink screen’s paper-like quality, which causes less eye strain for many people.\nBut there is a difference between ereaders and E Ink tablets. These larger e-ink devices also employ E Ink screens, but they have stylus input and are often used for note taking and other tasks in addition to reading ebooks. We have an entire guide devoted to helping you pick out an E Ink tablet.\nAre there ads on my ereader?\nThe base model Kindle and Kindle Paperwhite come with ads by default, but you can opt to pay $20 to remove them, either at the time of purchase or after you start using the device. The ads are limited to the lockscreen and are typically for other books or Kindle services. Kobo and Boox ereaders don’t come with ads.\nWhich ereader has the longest battery life?\nOf the devices we tested, the Boox Go Color 7 has the largest listed battery capacity at 2,300mAh (Amazon doesn’t list the capacity of its Kindle devices). But thanks to the nature of E Ink screens and the relatively limited processing power required to display e-books, nearly all ereaders can go for weeks before they need a recharge. That means battery life probably isn’t as much of a deciding factor in buying an ereader as it would be with a tablet or smartphone.\nWhich ereaders can read Kindle books?\nAmazon’s Kindle ereaders are the obvious answer, but other devices capable of running apps can also read titles from the Kindle store. For example, you can download the Kindle app on a Boox ereader through Google Play (the store comes standard in the Boox app menu). You can then sign into your Kindle account and access all the books in your library — the same way you’d read Kindle books on your phone or tablet.\nCan you buy Kindle books without a Kindle?\nYes. You can buy Kindle books through the Kindle app or through Amazon’s website via a browser. You can read those titles on a Kindle or any device that can run the Kindle app, such as a smartphone, tablet or computer. Just be aware that Kindle titles can only be read through one of Amazon’s ereaders or the Kindle app. The company uses proprietary digital rights management on all ebooks it sells that can’t be read by other ereader apps like Kobo or Adobe ADE.\nWhat's the difference between Kindle and Kobo?\nBoth Kindle and Kobo are brands of dedicated ereaders that support searching, buying, downloading and reading ebooks from their own stores. Both also support borrowing books from your local library via Overdrive and Libby.\nThe difference is that Kindle is owned by Amazon and uses the Kindle store, whereas Kobo is owned by Rakuten and its books come from the Kobo store. Both stores come pre-loaded as a tab on their respective ereader and both carry most in-print books. Each store also carries their own exclusive ebooks as well, but Amazon’s library of Kindle-only books is much larger than Kobo’s. Amazon also offers Amazon Original stories to read on the Kindle, which are free short fiction and nonfiction reads that are free to Prime members.\nWhich ereader is best for library books?\nBoth Kobos and Kindles have simple systems for borrowing library books. Other ereaders, like Boox, let you borrow books after downloading the Libby App. Only Kobo ereaders let you search for and borrow books directly on the ereader, with a dedicated Overdrive tab. Kindles, on the other hand, utilize a convenient “read on Kindle” function from the Libby app or website. You can send a borrowed book to your Kindle just by signing into your account. Both methods are pretty easy, so which is the best for you probably depends on other factors than just the library-book feature.\nRecent updates\nAugust 2025: Included new frequently asked questions covering battery life, E Ink screens and ads on ereaders. Mentioned Amazon’s release of a cheaper Colorsoft Kindle.\nJuly 2025: Added our impressions of the new stylus-enabled Boox Go 7 series. Updated our Boox Palma recommendation to account for the upgrades to the Boox Palma 2. Included text formats to our specs and the battery life of the Kobo Clara Colour.\nMarch 2025: Added news about Bookshop.org getting into the ebook market.

Updated book titles to current examples. Added an FAQ section to explain the difference between Kobo and Kindle ereaders and further detail library-book support on different models. \nNovember 2024: Following the release of Amazon's new Kindle ereaders, we tested and reviewed the Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition, the base-model Kindle and Amazon's new color ereader, the Kindle Colorsoft. Accordingly, we updated our budget pick, added a premium pick and noted our experience with the Colorsoft. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/best-ereader-130013808.html?src=rss",
    "full_text": "When Rakuten announced the Clara would be updated, I worried we’d see Kobo device with superfluous revamping to justify an inflated price. I created one with larger text and wider line spacing called “tired eyes.” Some people won’t be bothered by the lock screen ads that come standard on this Kindle (unless you pay $20 to remove them). You can pick from four different highlighter colors and view your written notes and spotlighted text in the notes section of any title — which I could see being pretty useful for book club reads, school assignments or just refreshing yourself on a past read before you dive into the sequel. While there is a store, it’s made up of public domain titles — most people will read books by uploading ePubs manually. But what makes ebook readers different is the screen: nearly all of them use technology from a company called E Ink. Because these displays are so different from standard backlight LED panels, you can expect most good ereaders to do a number of things well. Amazon offers Kindle Unlimited for $12 per month, and it includes four million titles from which you can pick your next read. After downloading a compatible ePub file, drag and drop it into your browser with the Send to Kindle page open. The company uses proprietary digital rights management on all ebooks it sells that can’t be read by other ereader apps like Kobo or Adobe ADE. Only Kobo ereaders let you search for and borrow books directly on the ereader, with a dedicated Overdrive tab."

    "summary": "Whether you're working in a noisy office, commuting on a packed train or just trying to focus at home, a good pair of noise-canceling headphones can make all the difference. The best noise-canceling headphones block out distractions and let you enjoy your music, podcasts or calls in peace — all while delivering great sound quality and all-day comfort. From models with plush cushions to wireless cans with loads of extra features, there’s something here for every style and budget.\nTable of contents\n\nBest noise-canceling headphones for 2025\nHow to choose the best noise-canceling headphones for you\nHow we test noise-canceling headphones\nOther noise-canceling headphones we tested\nNoise-canceling headphones FAQs\n\nBest noise-canceling headphones of 2025\n \n \n \n \n \n\nHow to choose the best noise-canceling headphones for you\nDesign\nWhen you’re shopping for the best wireless headphones, the first thing you’ll need to decide on is wear style. Do you prefer on-ear or over-ear headphones? For the purposes of this guide, I focus on the over-ear style as that’s what most noise-canceling headphones are nowadays. Sure, you can find on-ear models with ANC, but over-ear, active noise-canceling headphones are much more effective at blocking outside sounds since your ears are completely covered. \nFor gamers, there are also gaming headsets that feature noise cancellation — some even have detachable microphones, so they can double as over-ear headphones. However, for the purpose of this article, we’re only going to be focusing on noise-canceling headphones rather than headsets. Look for models with a comfortable headband and memory foam ear cups to ensure you can wear them for long periods without discomfort.\nMany headphones also come with a range of color options, so if aesthetics matter to you, you’ll find plenty of choices beyond just black or white. Whether you’re looking for something neutral or a bold pop of color, brands now offer a variety of styles to match your personal taste.\nFinally, if you’re planning to wear your headphones for long periods of time, it’s important to pick a model with a comfortable fit. Memory foam ear cups, an adjustable headband, and lightweight materials can make all the difference during extended listening sessions. After all, great sound is only part of the equation; comfort matters just as much.\nType of noise cancellation\nNext, you’ll want to look at the type of ANC a set of headphones offers. You’ll come across terms like “hybrid active noise cancellation” or “hybrid adaptive active noise cancellation,” and there are key differences between the two. A hybrid ANC setup uses microphones on the inside and on the outside of the device to detect outside noise and cancel it out. By analyzing input from both mics, a hybrid system can combat more sounds than “regular” ANC, but it does so at a constant level that doesn’t change.\nAdaptive ANC takes the hybrid configuration a step further by continuously adjusting the noise cancellation for changes in your environment and any leakage around the padding of the ear cups. Adaptive noise-canceling also does a better job with wind noise, which can really kill your vibe while using headphones outdoors. Some high-end headphones also support Dolby Atmos, which enhances spatial audio and makes everything from music to movies sound more immersive. For the purposes of this best headphones list, I’m only considering products with hybrid ANC or adaptive ANC setups because those are the most effective at blocking noise and improving your overall listening experience.\nCustomization\nYou’ll also want to check to see if the ANC system on a prospective set of headphones offers adjustable levels of noise cancellation or presets. These can help you dial in the amount of ANC you need for various environments, but it can also help you save battery life. Master & Dynamic, for example, has ANC presets that provide both maximum noise blocking and more efficient cancellation that is more energy efficient. Other companies may include a slider in their companion apps that let you adjust the ANC level to your liking. Some high-end models even allow you to fine-tune the ANC for specific types of environments.\nHow we test noise-canceling headphones\nThe primary way we test headphones is to wear them as much as possible. I prefer to do this over a one-to-two-week period, but sometimes deadlines don’t allow it. During this time, I listen to a mix of music and podcasts, while also using the headphones to take both voice and video calls.\nSince battery life for headphones can be 30 hours or more, I drain the battery with looping music and the volume set at a comfortable level (usually around 75 percent). Due to the longer battery estimates, I’ll typically power the headphones off several times and leave them that way during a review. This simulates real-world use and keeps me from having to constantly monitor the process for over 24 straight hours.\nTo test ANC performance specifically, I use headphones in a variety of environments, from noisy coffee shops to quiet home offices. When my schedule allows, I use them during air travel since plane noise is a massive distraction to both work and relaxation. Even if I can’t hop on a flight, I’ll simulate a constant roar with white noise machines, bathroom fans, vacuums and more. I also make note of how well each device blocks human voices, which are a key stumbling block for a lot of ANC headphones.\nANC-related features are something else to consider. Here, I do a thorough review of companion apps, testing each feature as I work through the software. Any holdovers from previous models are double checked for improvements or regression. If the headphones I’m testing are an updated version of a previous model, I’ll spend time getting reacquainted with the older set. Ditto for the closest competition for each new set of headphones that I review.\nOther noise-canceling headphones we tested\nAirPods Max\nApple’s AirPods Max are premium, well-designed over-ear headphones that incorporate all of the best features you find on standard AirPods: solid noise cancellation, spatial audio and easy Siri access. However, their $550 starting price makes them almost prohibitively expensive, even for Apple users. There are better options available at lower prices, but if you can pick up the AirPods Max at a steep discount, they might be worthwhile for the biggest Apple fans among us.\nDyson On-Trac\nThe On-Trac headphones have an almost infinitely customizable design, and that’s what’s most unique about them. The sound profile offers some nice detail, but lacks dynamic range overall. ANC is average at best and there aren’t any advanced features that will make your life easier. Well, except for the hearing health monitor, which is actually handy. All told, that’s not a lot for a set of $500 headphones.\nSonos Ace\nThe Sonos Ace is an excellent debut for the company’s first headphones. The combination of refined design, great sound quality and home theater tricks creates a unique formula. However, ANC performance is just okay and key functionality is still in the works for many users.\nSony ULT Wear\nIf most headphones don’t have the level of bass you desire, the ULT Wear is an option to consider. The low-end thump isn’t for everyone, but there are also plenty of handy features and a refined look to make the $200 set more compelling than many in this price range.\nBeats Studio Pro\nThe Studio Pro lacks basic features like automatic pausing, and multipoint connectivity is only available on Android. Moreover, they’re not very comfortable for people with larger heads. Overall sound quality is improved, though, and voice performance on calls is well above average.\nMaster & Dynamic MH40 (2nd gen)\nThe MH40 are a great set of headphones if you favor crisp, clear and natural sound that isn’t overly tuned. This pair showcases the company’s affinity for leather and metal too, but limited customization and short battery life for non-ANC cans kept this set from making the cut.\nBowers & Wilkins Px8\nThe company’s trademark pristine sound is on display here, but the Px8 is more expensive and not nearly as comfortable as the Px7 S3.\nNoble Audio FoKus Apollo\nWhile this is my top pick for overall sound quality in our main guide to the best wireless headphones, the ANC performance is less impressive than the Px7 S3. Bowers & Wilkins gets the nod here for its improved noise cancellation over the Px7 S2 and Px7 S2e, and its overall excellent audio quality.\nNoise-canceling headphones FAQs\nDoes noise cancellation block all noise?\nNoise cancellation doesn’t block out all noise, though it does drastically reduce the volume of most external sounds.\nIs there a difference between wired vs wireless noise-canceling headphones?\nIn terms of sound quality, if you have two headphones — one wired and one wireless — with similar specs, the difference is going to be very minimal. However, wireless headphones offer more convenience, allowing you to move around more freely with your headphones on, which is why they often feature noise cancellation to minimize external sounds.\nDoes noise cancellation impact sound quality?\nANC does bear some weight on sound quality, but the impact of this often doesn’t outweigh the benefits. Noise cancellation reduces ambient noise, allowing a greater focus on audio detail. For audiophiles, however, there may be a small difference in sound fidelity when ANC is turned on.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/best-noise-canceling-headphones-130029881.html?src=rss",

It might also signal a new relationship with Sony and PlayStation Studios."

    "summary": "Germany-based search engine and browser nonprofit Ecosia is the latest party to make an offer for Google's Chrome. Questions about Chrome's fate have been swirling since the news that the Department of Justice would push for Google to sell the browser after the ruling that the company's search engine business constituted a monopoly. Although Google is planning to appeal the decision, that hasn't stopped other big tech businesses from pitching themselves as potential owners of Chrome.\nEcosia's proposal is different. Rather than selling off the valuable browser for an upfront windfall, this plan would see Google transforming Chrome into a foundation. Ecosia would assume operational responsibility for the browser for ten years, but Google would retain the ownership and intellectual property rights. Under the arrangement, Ecosia would devote about 60 percent of Chrome's profits toward climate and environmental projects. It wouldn't pay a cent upfront for the stewardship role, but the remaining 40 percent of Chrome's profits would be given back to Google. Considering Ecosia is projecting Chrome to generate $1 trillion over the next decade, that's no small potatoes.\nOn the surface, this idea is pretty far-out. However, going the stewardship route would deepen an existing relationship between Google and Ecosia. Google already powers the environmentally-focused benefit corporation's search engine, and the two parties have an established revenue-sharing agreement. Putting Chrome in the hands of a nonprofit rather than a for-profit rival may actually be a positive for Google, both financially and in public opinion.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/nonprofit-search-engine-ecosia-offers-0-for-control-of-chrome-212158739.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "\nThe Apple iPhone event is nearly here, which means we'll soon get to download iOS 26 and iPadOS 26. The OS 26es are coming with huge upgrades to your iPhone and iPad's operating systems. You've heard of Liquid Glass, right? It's like the better-executed version of Windows Vista and definitely one of the cooler features coming this fall. We spent two weeks test-driving it — you can check out our detailed hands-on iOS 26 preview, or you can try it out yourself by downloading and installing the public beta 4. That software is a more stable iteration of the separate developer version, which recently hit the beta 7 waypoint, and offers a few more flashy features not yet available in the public version. (While the public beta is open to everyone and quite stable, always remember there's a degree of risk involved with beta software.) Additionally, there are credible reports that iOS 26 could bring a new live translation feature to AirPods, too. Not sure if you want to upgrade your smartphone or tablet this year? No worries, we'll help you find out if your devices will be able to run iOS 26.\nWhile Apple didn't nix any iPhones from its eligibility list last year, that's not the case for 2025 — a few models are getting cut this time. All iPhone 8 models and the iPhone X were the last to get the boot in 2023, and this year the 2018 models are getting left behind. If you have an ineligible device, you won't be able to download iOS 26 when it becomes available this fall. \nWe'll get to the bottom of which iPhones and iPads will support iOS 26 and iPadOS 26 this year. To see what's coming with the latest OSes, check out everything announced at Apple's WWDC June 9 event. One thing you shouldn't immediately expect is Apple's updated version of Siri, though the company is reportedly working on a 'stripped-down' AI chatbot to compete with ChatGPT. \nThese three iPhones won't be compatible with iOS 26\nUnlike last year, several iPhone models won't be eligible to download the newest iOS when it makes its debut this fall. This trio of models first released in 2018 won't be coming to the iOS 26 party:\n\niPhone XR\niPhone XS\niPhone XS Max\n\niPhones compatible with iOS 26\nWhile we don't yet know the new iPhones Apple will be dropping this fall — though there are iPhone 17 rumors — we do know, per Apple's site, that the phones listed below will be compatible with iOS 26. Basically, if you have an iPhone that was announced in 2019 or later, you're in the clear:\n\niPhone SE (second generation or later)\niPhone 11\niPhone 11 Pro\niPhone 11 Pro Max\niPhone 12\niPhone 12 mini\niPhone 12 Pro\niPhone 12 Pro Max\niPhone 13\niPhone 13 mini\niPhone 13 Pro\niPhone 13 Pro Max\niPhone 14\niPhone 14 Plus\niPhone 14 Pro\niPhone 14 Pro Max\niPhone 15\niPhone 15 Plus\niPhone 15 Pro\niPhone 15 Pro Max\niPhone 16\niPhone 16 Plus\niPhone 16 Pro\niPhone 16 Pro Max\niPhone 16e\n\niPads compatible with iPadOS 26\nThe iPads listed below, and any iPads released later this year, are eligible to download iPadOS 26.\n\niPad Pro (M4)\niPad Pro 12.9‑inch (3rd generation and later)\niPad Pro 11‑inch (1st generation and later)\niPad Air (3rd generation and later, including M2 and M3)\niPad (8th generation and later, including A16)\niPad mini (5th generation and later, including A17 Pro)\n\nWhat if I don't want to buy a new iPhone?\nIf you want to continue using your older iPhone that isn't supported by iOS 26, that's fine. However, you'll miss out on security updates which could potentially put your phone at risk for malware and other threats. Additionally, some apps may stop working if they require a certain version of iOS or later. And of course, you won't be able to access the latest features iOS 26 offers.\nWhen will iOS 26 become available?\nApple usually rolls out its latest iOS in mid-September, just a few days before the new iPhones hit store shelves. Last year, it released iOS 18 on Monday, Sept. 16. Expect a confirmation of the release date at the iPhone 17 event, expected in early September. \niOS 26 features we're excited about\nLiquid Glass design: Your home screen is getting revamped with new app icons, including dark mode and all-clear options. You'll also notice buttons with a new floating design. Liquid Glass was designed to make all of Apple's OSes more cohesive.\nPhone app redesign: You'll finally be able to scroll through contacts, recent calls and voicemail messages all on one screen. It also comes with a new feature called Hold Assist that'll notify you when an agent comes to the phone so you can avoid the elevator music.\nLive Translate: iOS 26 is bringing the ability to have a conversation via phone call or text message with someone who speaks another language. Live Translate will translate your conversation in real time. \nPolls feature: Coming to group messages in the Messages app, chat members will be able to create polls. This can help prevent the unwanted 30+ messages when it comes to deciding which restaurant you're meeting at this weekend.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/apples-new-ios-26-public-beta-4-is-here-but-is-your-iphone-compatible-check-this-list-191854764.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "The latest and greatest of the foldable phone world. (Google, Sam Rutherford/Engadget)\nLast month, the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 was released and immediately became the de facto king of the foldable phone hill. But now a new challenger has arrived: The Pixel 10 Pro Fold. The full details are now available in the wake of Google's splashy launch event, which debuted the Fold alongside the full new Pixel 10 line, a new Pixel smartwatch and two new earbuds, too (see everything Google announced). But the Pixel 10 Pro Fold was the star of the show, and it's vying with the Z Fold 7 for the title of best foldable — both offer very similar designs, but each bringing something unique to the table.\nSamsung launched its first foldable phone in 2019, so it's had quite a bit of time to refine the Galaxy Fold over the years. Google on the other hand just released its first Pixel Fold a couple years ago — but has already largely evened the match. And, of course, with enhanced Gemini AI software integration front and center, you'll have access to Google's impressive artificial intelligence features at nearly every turn.\nWe'll break down how the Pixel 10 Pro Fold and Galaxy Z Fold 7 stack up to one another. You can also check out our comparison of the Pixel 9 Pro Fold and the Galaxy Fold 6 to see how much has changed in a year. \nPrice\nFirst things first, how much will one of these high-tech folding phones cost you? That is the make-or-break question, after all. The newest Pixel foldable is still less expensive than this year's Z Fold: it starts at $1,799 while the Galaxy smartphone starts at $2,000.\nYou don't have any other real choices for \"book-style\" foldables in the US market. The OnePlus Open can be had for $1,499, but it's almost two years old. And Apple's most expensive phone is currently the $1,599 1TB iPhone 16 Pro Max — but as a non-foldable model with just a single screen, it's hardly a straight comparison. If the rumor mill is to be believed, Apple may finally bow a foldable iPhone in 2026.\nDimensions and display\nIt's a race for the largest display and Samsung won this time — but not by much. The Galaxy Z Fold is just a hair bigger than the Pixel Pro Fold. Both phones' inner displays are 8 inches across when fully opened, while Samsung comes out ahead on the outer display with 6.5 inches (the Pixel is 6.4 inches).\nAs for height, the new foldable Pixel phone is 6.1 inches and the Galaxy Z is 6.2 inches — not a huge difference there. When unfolded, the Samsung wins on size efficiency, packing the identically sized 8-inch internal display into an area that's 0.3 inches smaller — 5.6 inches versus the Pixel's 5.9.\nThis year, the Pixel 10 Pro Fold’s displays have been upgraded to a Super Actua Flex OLED display with ultra-thin glass. Both the front screen and back cover come equipped with Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2.\nAs for the Galaxy Z Fold 7, it has a Dynamic AMOLED display (inner and outer) and comes with the Corning Gorilla Glass Ceramic 2 on the front and the Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on the backside. The glass is ultra-thin, yet it's 50 percent thicker than before.\nWhile slightly bigger, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 is still lighter than the Pixel 10 Pro Fold. The Samsung model weighs only 7.6 ounces — down nearly an ounce from its 2024 model — while its Google competition comes in at 9.1 ounces (the same as last year's model).\nThe Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 (left) compared to the new Pixel 10 Pro Fold (right). (Sam Rutherford/Engadget)\nProcessor, RAM, storage and battery\nThe Pixel 10 Fold Pro runs the Tensor G5 chip — Google says its CPU features 34 percent better performance compared to the Tensor G4 chip.\nThe Z Fold 7 is powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy. \"Everything feels fast and snappy,\" Engadget's Sam Rutherford said of the Snapdragon 8 Elite performance on the Z Fold 7. (Sam also has first impressions of the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, but speed tests will happen a bit later.)\nBoth phones offer the choice of 256GB, 512GB or 1TB storage. On the RAM front, the Pixel Fold delivers 16GB across the line, while the Samsung model reserves that level for the top 1TB storage tier; the small models get 12GB instead. The Galaxy phone will cost you $2,419 if you decide you need the maximum amount of storage, whereas the Pixel Fold tops out at $2,149.\nWhen it comes to battery life, Samsung's foldable lasts up to 24 hours with a 4,400mAh battery. The Pixel lasts up to 30 hours thanks to a more capacious 5,015mAh battery rating. Furthermore, the Pixel Fold is certified for Qi2 wireless charging, which Google is branding as \"Pixelsnap\" across its 2025 Pixel line for the first time.\nCameras\nFor many shoppers, a phone is only as good as its cameras, and both of these phones bring a strong lens game. Each has three rear cameras, though they're different aesthetically. You'll notice the Pixel has a larger camera bump with two rows, while the Galaxy has a thinner vertical line of cameras.\nThe Pixel 10 Pro Fold's rear camera array consists of a 48MP wide sensor, a 10.5MP ultrawide and a 10.8MP telephoto with 5x optical zoom. All three offer \"Super Res Zoom\" up to 20x with optical and electronic image stabilization. Per our own Sam Rutherford, the potential drawback here is that Google played it safe: \"The biggest potential shortcoming of the P10PF is that its camera hardware is largely staying the same. Granted, that's not a huge deal because the previous model had the best photo quality of any foldable phone.\"\nBy comparison, the Samsung Galaxy Fold 7 rear camera trio includes the same 200MP wide-angle camera as the company's Galaxy S25 Ultra, but carries over the 12MP ultrawide and 10MP telephone from the Z Fold 6. Zoom levels are 3x optical and 30x digital.\nWhile we have yet to put the Pixel 10 Pro Fold cameras through their paces, Sam was still liking last year's Pixel Fold versus the Galaxy Z Fold 7 when he reviewed the latter: \"At night, the Fold 7's shots remained surprisingly sharp.

It has partnered with the likes of OpenTable, Resy and Tock to incorporate as many restaurants as possible and streamline the booking process. Right now, this feature is exclusive to those subscribed to the wildly expensive Google AI Ultra plan in the US, and can be accessed through its Labs platform. If you opt into the AI Mode experiment it can also remember your previous conversations and searches to give you results that more closely match your preferences.\nFinally, if your AI-powered conversations are simply too interesting to keep to yourself, Google will now let you bring others in when you tap the \"Share\" button on a response.

So we get excited when one of the all-around best headphones out there goes on an aggressive sale. You can pick up a pair of XM5s right now for just $274, which is 32 percent off its normal retail price of $400.\n \nIn our review of the XM5 we awarded a score of 95 out of 100, impressed with just about every aspect of the set with the notable exception of its price, which makes a sale like this all the more exciting. The XM5s are supremely comfortable, thanks to a slim cushioned headband and soft earcups. In our review, we had no problem wearing them for hours at a time and never felt uncomfortable pressure on the ears or head. \n30mm carbon-fiber drivers deliver excellent audio, delivering a wide and immersive soundstage. The XM5 carries eight total microphones as part of its active noise-canceling system, up from four on the previous model, and delivers top-of-class ANC.\nThe battery life on these headphones is best in class, with around 30 hours of listening per charge. Touch controls on the outside panel of the right ear cup help you control your music with ease, allowing you to play, pause, skip tracks and adjust the volume right from the headphones. The only real downside at this point is you’re buying a pair of headphones that are three years old; the XM6 offers some noteworthy improvements. But, of course, it’ll cost you.\nIf you've been thinking about upgrading your headphones, or picking up your first pair of real high-quality cans, then take advantage of these savings.

    "summary": "Sennheiser's most expensive Ambeo soundbar is getting a substantial update. The company announced that the Ambeo Soundbar Max, a $2,000 beast of a living room speaker, will gain two features it calls Customizable Immersion and Voice Enhancement Mode. Plus, the company is adding lossless audio support on top of Dolby Atmos Music. The firmware update will equip the Max with Ambeo OS2 and is available via free download through the Sennheiser Smart Control app for iOS and Android. \nWith Customizable Immersion, Sennheiser will give users the ability to adjust volume levels for side, top and center channel virtualization. The company says this will allow customers to tailor the immersion to their preferences or to the content they're watching. As you might expect, Voice Enhancement Mode boosts dialogue to ensure it remains clear when sound effects or music would otherwise overpower the mix in movies, TV shows or during sports events. \nThe Ambeo Soundbar Max already offered support for spatial audio for tunes via Dolby Atmos Music, but now the living room speaker will allow you to play lossless audio too. Sennheiser says you can expect up to 24-bit/96kHz through Google Cast and up to 24-bit/192kHz from Tidal Connect. \nThe Ambeo Soundbar Max originally arrived in 2019 as the Ambeo Soundbar. Sennheiser changed the name when it expanded the Ambeo Soundbar lineup, which now includes the mid-sized Plus and compact Mini options. The Max was $2,500 at launch before rising to $3,000, but the company is now selling it's biggest home theater unit for $2,000. That may seem like a lot for one piece of your setup, but Sennheiser promises the combination of bass performance and Ambeo tech means you won't need a separate subwoofer or rear satellite speakers. Those claims held up during my review of the soundbar back when it debuted.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/sennheiser-updates-the-ambeo-max-soundbar-with-lossless-audio-customizable-immersion-and-more-134707400.html?src=rss",
