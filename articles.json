    "full_text": "Apple on Thursday signaled that it’s getting more serious about its plans to catch up in the AI race. We are also significantly growing our investments,” CEO Tim Cook said on the Q3 2025 earnings call with investors. The company also noted that it has already acquired seven companies this year. None was “huge” in terms of dollar amount, Cook said. But Apple has defended itself by saying that it doesn’t need to rush — that launching the wrong features or the wrong products just to be first would be a mistake. Later this year, Apple plans to launch AI features like live translation and an AI-powered workout buddy, but the more personalized Siri’s improvements have been delayed to 2026.

    "full_text": "Previously, she was a writer and editor at MUO. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company is “open” to mergers and acquisitions as it “significantly” increases its investment in AI, as reported by CNBC. Cook’s statements were made alongside the release of Apple’s third-quarter earnings results, which revealed that the iPhone-maker raked in $94 billion between April and June, marking a 10 percent increase over the same period last year. Last month, a report from Bloomberg said that Apple may enlist the help of AI giants, like OpenAI and Anthropic, to power its “LLM Siri.” Bloomberg also reported in June that Apple leaders discussed acquiring the AI search startup Perplexity. Despite the AI hiccups, Apple’s core businesses remain strong. Mac revenue also saw a boost, reaching $8.1 billion in revenue, likely due to Apple releasing a new MacBook Air in March. There may be other challenges coming for those businesses, though. There’s a chance these costs could go even higher, as Trump has threatened Apple with a tariff of “at least” 25 percent if the company doesn’t bring production to the US. Apple has already shifted some of its production to India to decrease its reliance on China, a move Trump isn’t a fan of. Apple is expected to launch its new iPhone 17 lineup sometime in September."

    "full_text": "During the most recent Prime Day, the Google Pixel Tablet with Wi-Fi and 256GB of storage briefly dropped to just $309 ($190 off) — but the deal disappeared in a matter of hours. Unfortunately, the discount is for today only (or until supplies last) and doesn’t include the speaker dock. In his Pixel Tablet review, former Verge editor Dan Seifert noted that the device doesn’t seem interested in pushing the boundaries, but its solid hardware and speedy performance make it a great option for Android users. The device features a sharp 11-inch LCD display, a soft-touch matte finish, and four speakers that provide clear audio and noticeable stereo separation. Like most modern devices, it lacks a headphone jack, so you’ll have to either use Bluetooth or USB-C headphones. Meanwhile, the tablet integrates well with an optional fabric speaker dock. At this point, Google’s tablet aspirations are up in the air, with rumors suggesting any subsequent sequels have been canned. The company has an event scheduled for August 20th, where we’re expecting new Pixel phones to debut, including a new book-style foldable. Whether or not we’ll see a new tablet remains to be seen. It’s worth noting, however, that Google is only promising three years of software upgrades and five years of security updates from its release in 2023, which is much shorter than the seven years of support offered for newer Pixel phones."

    "full_text": "He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme. Reddit knows that it has valuable data from actual people — it’s already reached deals with big AI companies like OpenAI and Google to share its data with them. But Reddit is also investing in improving its own search capabilities, and in its latest note to investors, CEO Steve Huffman says that the company is “concentrating our resources on the areas that will drive results for our most pressing needs,” including “making Reddit a go-to search engine.” Huffman says that “every week, hundreds of millions of people come to Reddit looking for advice, and we’re turning more of that intent into active users of Reddit’s native search.” Reddit’s core search has more than 70 million weekly active unique users — Reddit overall averages 416.4 million weekly active unique users — and Reddit Answers, the platform’s AI search tool that it launched in December, has 6 million weekly users, up from 1 million weekly users in the first quarter of this year. To continue to build out search, Reddit is “expanding Reddit Answers globally, integrating it more deeply into the core search experience, and making search a central feature across Reddit,” Huffman says. Of course, the move to build out its own search capabilities could be a hedge against losing traffic from Google, which is increasingly finding new ways to give you answers with AI instead of providing a list of links. Appending the word “Reddit” to Google searches is a classic way to try and get information written by humans, and Reddit has seen an influx of traffic as a result. But if Google becomes a less reliable source of traffic for Reddit, the platform may need to have better search for itself. Reddit turned 20 last month, and the company is going big on AI. (In an interview at the time, CTO Chris Slowe told The Verge that the initial rollout of Reddit Answers is “going really well.”) “The internet is evolving, and our role as a community-powered platform for human connection is only becoming more critical,” Huffman says."

It's clear that Franklin is no average infant either -- Galactus identified the baby as a worthy planet-eating successor, and Franklin's mere presence around his mother seemed enough to resurrect her after the final boss battle. The scene takes place four years later, meaning Franklin is no longer a tiny tot. But the good times are cut short when Sue senses something is off. The Avengers movie will star Robert Downey Jr. as Doom and is scheduled for release on Dec. 18, 2026. The two were once university classmates but never close friends as Victor put himself above everyone. Over the course of storylines, they've battled each other while occasionally dropping their beef to fight a common threat. Franklin can create what's called \"pocket universes,\" which are basically self-contained within a larger universe. and Fantastic Four, Doctor Doom could be looking to harness the young boy's powers to either stop -- or take advantage of -- whatever disaster is on the horizon."

    "full_text": "In Brief Over a decade after “The Social Network,” director Aaron Sorkin is reportedly working on a sequel, possibly with two leads in mind. While the 2010 original film focused on Mark Zuckerberg’s rise, “Social Network Part II” is said to draw from Jeff Horwitz’s “The Facebook Files,” which exposed Facebook’s harmful effects on teens and its role in spreading misinformation. According to Deadline, Jeremy Allen White from “The Bear” is being considered for the role of Horwitz, while Mikey Madison, known for her Oscar-winning role in “Anora,” may portray Frances Haugen, the whistleblower behind the articles who was a former product manager at Facebook. Sorkin has reportedly met with both actors, but it’s important to note that the film is still in development and hasn’t been greenlit by Sony Pictures yet."

    "full_text": "While today’s Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase may have lacked the splash of anticipated third-party games like Hades 2 or FromSoftware’s The Duskbloods, what was on display offered some interesting insight. Showcases like this one offer Nintendo’s second- and third-party development and publishing partners the chance to show off what they’ve got on the way. During this Direct, we got a look at Cronos: The New Dawn, a new game from Silent Hill 2 remake studio Bloober Team. Cronos looks like the kind of game that would have struggled on the original Switch, but it’s releasing across all three consoles and PC on September 5th. Star Wars Outlaws has been out since August of last year. (And the most recent game in that collection was released more than 10 years ago.) Borderlands 4, while not launching exactly day and date, will come out on the Switch 2 a mere three weeks after its PC/Xbox/PlayStation launch. Nintendo’s always been the kind of company to do what it wants rather than chase market trends, and that strategy has served the company very well. And even if not everything new will come to the Switch 2, the console still has a robust back catalog to bring forward. During today’s Direct we saw that Sega’s Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio is bringing the Yakuza Kiwami series to the Switch 2."

    "summary": "Liquid Glass is a huge new change coming to iOS 26. (Apple)\nIf waiting until the fall to gain access to all of Apple's iOS 26 features seems too far away, I've got good news. You can actually give it a test run now by downloading and installing the public beta. You can also check out our preview of the iOS 26 public beta release, which shows off the fresh home and lock screen redesign we've been asking to see for years. Called Liquid Glass, the new translucent look will extend across all of Apple's upcoming operating systems. The overhaul is one of several big changes coming to iOS, macOS, iPadOS and the rest of Apple's software suite, all of which were showcased during the company's WWDC keynote on June 9. \nAfter overpromising on AI plans last year, Apple kept its iOS roadmap focused more on basic quality of life improvements this year. There are multiple useful additions coming to the Phone and Messages apps on your iPhone, for instance: Apple execs outlined the ability to weed out spam texts or other unknown senders and an option to hold your spot on a phone call when you've been waiting for a representative to pick up. Plus, a treasured feature that we took for granted is coming back (hint: it's in the Photos app).\nSiri, meanwhile, is in a holding pattern. Apple has previously specified that its smarter voice assistant — first promised at WWDC 2024 — is delayed until some point \"in the coming year,\" so you shouldn't expect any major changes in the current betas. But there are reports that Apple is aiming to give Siri a bigger brain transplant by basing it on third-party artificial intelligence models like OpenAI's ChatGPT or Anthropic's Claude, which could make 2026 a pivotal year.\nWith each beta, it seems like additional new improvements are popping up, like a newly discovered FaceTime feature that'll freeze your video if it detects nudity. Most newer iPhone models are eligible to download iOS 26 (both the betas and final version). Want to see the full list of new features coming this fall? Read on.  \nWhat is iOS 26?\nThe current iPhone operating system is iOS 18, and Apple is still actively updating it — version 18.6 was just recently released. But don't expect to see iOS 19. Instead, Apple is skipping the numbering ahead to iOS 26 later this year. The company has decided to line up its iOS version numbers with a year-based system, similar to car model years. So while iOS and its sibling operating systems will be released in late 2025, they're all designated \"26\" to reflect the year ahead. (Meanwhile, iOS 18 is still getting new versions this summer, too.)\nIt's official, we're moving to iOS 26. (Apple)\nWhat is Liquid Glass design?\nLet's be honest. Out of everything announced at WWDC this year, the new Liquid Glass design was the star of the show. The iPhone's home and lock screens have looked pretty much the same year after year — the last exciting thing (in my opinion) was the option to add your own aesthetic to your home screen by customizing your apps and widgets. So seeing the home and lock screens' new facelift is refreshing.\nSo what exactly is Liquid Glass? Apple calls it a \"new translucent material\" since, well, the apps and widgets are clear. However, the screen can still adapt to dark and light modes, depending on surroundings. You'll also notice buttons with a new floating design in several apps, like Phone and Maps. They're designed to be less distracting than the current buttons, but are still easy to see. While the design overhaul has proven to be controversial since its announcement, some — including Engadget's own Devindra Hardawar — like the new direction, even if it's somewhat reminiscent of Microsoft's translucent Windows Vista Aero designs from nearly twenty years ago.\nThat said, as of the release of the iOS 26 beta 2, Apple has already incorporated some user feedback into the design, dialing back the transparency in at least some places. And while it will continue to evolve, Apple users won't be able to escape it: Liquid Glass was designed to make all of Apple's OSes more cohesive. Here's a look at how the translucent aesthetic will look with the new macOS Tahoe 26 on your desktop.\nWhat are the new and notable features of iOS 26?\niOS 26 has a laundry list of new features. Among the most worthwhile:\nPhone app redesign: You'll finally be able to scroll through contacts, recent calls and voicemail messages all on one screen. It also comes with a new feature called Hold Assist that'll notify you when an agent comes to the phone so you can avoid the elevator music and continue on with other tasks.\nLive Translation in Phone, FaceTime and Messages: iOS 26 is bringing the ability to have a conversation via phone call or text message with someone who speaks another language. Live Translation will translate your conversation in real time, which results in some stop-and-go interactions in the examples Apple shared during its presentation.\nPolls in group chats: Tired of sorting through what seems like hundreds of messages in your group chat? You and your friends will soon be able to create polls in group messages for deciding things like which brunch spot you're eating at or whose car you're taking on a road trip.\nFiltering unknown senders in Messages: If you haven't received spam texts about unpaid tolls or other citations, you're lucky. For those of us who have, those annoying messages will soon be filtered away in a separate folder.\nVisual Intelligence: Similar to a reverse Google image search, this new feature will allow you to search for anything that's on your iPhone screen. For instance, if you spot a pair of shoes someone is wearing in an Instagram photo, you can screenshot it and use Visual Intelligence to find those shoes (or similar ones) online.\nPhotos tabs are back: For anyone who's still frustrated with the Photos changes made last year, you'll be happy to know that your tabs are coming back. Library and Collections will have their own separate spaces so you don't have to scroll to infinity to find what you're looking for.\nFaceTime \"Communication Safety\" feature: A newer addition to iOS 26 appears to be the FaceTime \"Communication Safety\" feature that pauses communications if and when nudity is detected. The feature appears to be a child safety feature that uses on-device detection, thus obviating any cloud-based privacy issues. \nApple's Hold Assist will be nifty for those pesky services that put you on hold for 10 or more minutes. (Apple)\nWhich iPhones will be able to upgrade to iOS 26?\nA few iPhone models that run the current version of iOS — iPhone XR, XS and XS Max — won't be compatible with the latest upgrade. But any iPhones released in 2019 or later will be eligible for the iOS 26 update.\n\niPhone SE (second generation or later)\niPhone 11\niPhone 11 Pro\niPhone 11 Pro Max\niPhone 12\niPhone 12 mini\niPhone 12 Pro\niPhone 12 Pro Max\niPhone 13\niPhone 13 mini\niPhone 13 Pro\niPhone 13 Pro Max\niPhone 14\niPhone 14 Plus\niPhone 14 Pro\niPhone 14 Pro Max\niPhone 15\niPhone 15 Plus\niPhone 15 Pro\niPhone 15 Pro Max\niPhone 16e\niPhone 16\niPhone 16 Plus\niPhone 16 Pro\niPhone 16 Pro Max\n\nNot listed here are the presumed new iPhone 17 models (or maybe iPhone 26?) that are all but certain to be announced and released in September. \nHow to install iOS 26 beta\nThe iOS 26 public beta is now available to download via the Apple Beta Software Program. If you're not already a member, you'll need to sign up to try out all the latest features. Just visit beta.apple.com and sign up with your phone number or email address. It's free.\nOnce you're in, you can install it by going to Settings > General > Software Update and selecting iOS 26 public beta.\nA word of caution: Don't sign up with your main iPhone unless you're OK with any risks that occur with using an OS that isn't finalized.\nWhen will the final version of iOS 26 be released?\niOS 26 will be released to the public this fall. It usually comes in September, within a week of the Apple iPhone event. Last year, it rolled out to iPhone users on September 16 — exactly one week after the iPhone 16 lineup was announced.\nIf you're more interested in the Apple Intelligence features coming, here's everything Apple revealed for iOS, macOS and more during WWDC. Also, check out how iOS 26 screenshots could be an intriguing preview of Apple's delayed Siri rework.\nUpdate, July 31: Noted that iOS 18.6 is now available. \nUpdate, July 24: Noted the iOS 26 public beta is now available.\nUpdate, July 3: Noted new FaceTime feature found in the developer beta.\nUpdate, June 30: Noted ongoing iOS 18 releases, and reports that Apple is considering additional external LLMs for Siri. \nUpdate, June 25: Noted changes added in iOS 26 beta 2. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/ios-26-beta-release-heres-everything-you-need-to-know-about-new-apple-features-and-how-to-get-it-on-your-iphone-135749519.html?src=rss",

    "full_text": "He joined The Verge in 2021 after several years covering news at Engadget. Posts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed. Following an appeals court victory on Thursday, Epic CEO Tim Sweeney tweeted that “the Epic Games Store for Android will be coming to the Google Play Store.” This is despite Google’s plan to appeal the Ninth Circuit panel’s decision, which declined to overturn a 2023 jury verdict that Google’s app store and payment system had become illegal monopolies. There’s no detail yet on timing, but it would make accessing Fortnite and other Epic-distributed games much simpler on Android devices, without relying on sideloading or making deals with phone manufacturers to preload the store. Epic may not be the only company to put a rival app store inside of Google’s Play Store in the near future. The Ninth Circuit appears to have lifted a stay on the entire permanent injunction that Epic won against Google’s app store monopolies, and that injunction would force Google to crack open Android for other third-party stores as well. “The stay is lifted,” Epic spokesperson Cat McCormack confirms to The Verge. The Epic Games Store on Android maintains your persistent status in games across platforms, and earlier this year, the company brought its weekly free games program to the mobile stores, too. It also has other Epic games, like Fall Guys and Rocket League Sideswipe. In a statement provided to The Verge, Google’s global head of regulatory affairs Lee-Anne Mulholland said, “This decision will significantly harm user safety, limit choice, and undermine the innovation that has always been central to the Android ecosystem."

I've been a fan of found footage horror movies since the original Blair Witch Project way back in 1999. Hell House LLC delivers a creepy, dread-filled descent that avoids the pitfalls of the genre and sends chills up my spine every time I watch it. A haunt attraction goes terribly wrong in Hell House LLC. Hell House LLC starts with how things ended, which means that as you watch everything happening, you know it's all going to end in tragedy. When Sara arrives at the interview, she brings tapes that have never been seen before. While things are initially a little campy with a pack of 20-somethings exploring the hotel and discussing their plans, things quickly begin to go south. Sara and her friends aren't immune either, as they each begin to be affected by the house. I won't spoil the third act when events ramp up from extremely creepy to blood-curdling. Hell House LLC has reached cult classic status for good reason, and it's one of those horror movies I play on repeat."

The company and existing investors sold shares at the IPO price of $33 per share. Quite the pop. There has been so much demand for this stock that people on X are posting funny pictures of their orders being fulfilled by Robinhood. Instead of getting dozens or hundreds of shares as requested, they are being allocated one solitary share, they say. (One person bragged about getting 17 shares.) In any case, the successful IPO means Figma’s failed $20 billion acquisition by competitor Adobe in 2023 is now just a shoulder-shrug footnote in the company’s history."

Deadline reported on the new film, The Social Network Part II, late last month. It will apparently delve into the story of the Facebook Files, a series of articles from The Wall Street Journal that reported on harms caused by Meta’s platforms (at the time, the company was called Facebook) based on leaked documents. Last night, Deadline also reported that Mikey Madison and Jeremy Allen White are also leading picks for roles in the new film. However, like with Strong, “no formal offers have been given to either actor,” according to Deadline’s “insiders.” Deadline said that White will “ideally” play Jeff Horwitz, a former WSJ journalist who wrote many of the articles in the Facebook Files series, while Madison will likely play Frances Haugen, a former Facebook employee who was the whistleblower behind the documents. The first Social Network movie was released in 2010."

It's not a big deal if you miss it, as the moon will be over 90% full from Aug. 6 through Aug. 11, so you'll have plenty of chances to look up and see it. Venus and Jupiter don't make an appearance until much later in the evening, but they'll be visible with the naked eye. The other three will require some sort of magnification. The Perseids meteor shower is also active, so you may spy a shooting star or two, depending on how dark it is outside. According to The Old Farmer's Almanac, sturgeon were a staple food for Native Americans in the Great Lakes region, and the fish used to be a lot more abundant during mid- to late summer. Thus, scholars often refer to the fish as a living fossil. It's also a long-lived fish, with an average lifespan of 50 to 60 years."

The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected Google’s argument that the trial judge made legal errors in the antitrust case that unfairly favored Epic Games. Epic Games first filed its lawsuit in 2020 and was able to convince a jury in 2023 that Google illegally stifled competition. The trial judge ordered Google last October to open its app store to rivals and give Android users more choice when it comes to downloading apps. The order was on hold pending the outcome of Google’s appeal. Google argued to the appeals court that its Play Store competes with Apple’s App Store, and claimed that the trial judge unfairly prevented it from presenting that argument in defense against Epic’s antitrust claims."

By 2013, online dating had become the most popular way for heterosexual couples in America to meet, according to the longstanding “How Couples Meet and Stay Together” study from Stanford. The trend started on “Are we dating the same guy?”-style Facebook Groups, where women would post screenshots of potential dates’ profiles to find out if they were already seeing someone else. “That exchange kind of kicked off us talking constantly for the next week … We basically never stopped messaging each other.” “The knowledge that we had both spent a lot of time online making these dumb memes made it less daunting,” Rothfels said. “We explained it as a creative writing forum,” Rudy said. “My wife’s wit and cleverness … She makes me laugh more than anybody, and I believe it’s the same for her,” Rudy told TechCrunch. “There’s always a responsible distance that people should put between their presence online and themselves,” Rudy said."

California requires companies to obtain three permits to operate a commercial robotaxi service. So far, the state has granted Tesla just one of the permits, allowing it to run a ridehailing service with a human in the driver’s seat. The Alphabet-owned Waymo is currently the only company with all the permits to offer commercial driverless rides in San Francisco. Even though the service in Texas and California hasn’t yet achieved Musk’s promise of operating with “no one in the car,” Musk told Tesla investors last week that he plans to expand robotaxi service to Florida, Nevada, and Arizona."

    "full_text": "The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals will not overturn the unanimous jury verdict from 2023 that Google’s app store and payments system have become illegal monopolies — and it appears to be pressing play on a previously paused permanent injunction that would crack open Android to undo those monopolies. Judge M. Margaret McKeown begins her opinion for the panel: But the Google Play Store may not be protected from the consequences of its monopoly while Google tries to do so — it may need to start cracking open Android for third-party stores the way Judge James Donato ruled in his permanent injunction back in 2024. Last October, Donato pressed pause on all but one specific piece of his ruling while Google appealed, but today, Judge McKeown writes “The stay motion on appeal is denied as moot in light of our decision” — and Epic has already announced it will put its own app store within Google’s app store. Epic originally sued both Google and Apple in 2020 over the removal of its hit game Fortnite from both stores, though the case was more complicated than that. The appeals court did recognize Epic’s gambit today, writing that “Google removed Fortnite from the Play Store after Epic embedded secret code into the app’s software” that bypassed Google’s payment systems. Here are a few thoughts about why Epic won against Google, but not Apple. Apple’s “walled garden” is, as the district court in Apple noted, markedly different from Google’s “open distribution” approach […] Google admits as much, noting that “Android’s open philosophy offers users and developers wider choices” than iOS does, even as that openness “limit[s] Google’s ability to directly protect users from encountering malware and security threats when they download apps.” As a consequence of its business model, Apple does not license iOS to other OEMs in the way that Google licenses Android to Samsung, Motorola, and other smartphone manufacturers. She also uses McDonalds and Chick-fil-A to make a point that markets can overlap: McDonald’s might compete against Chick-fil-A in the fast- food market yet not compete against Chick-fil-A in the hamburger fast-food market (and instead compete with Wendy’s, Burger King, Sonic, and In-N-Out Burger."

Google has launched a new AI model called AlphaEarth Foundations, which can take images and measurements from satellites and other sources to create current and accurate digital representations of lands and waters. With all this data, scientists and researchers can monitor problems like water scarcity, deforestation and crop health. Google says AlphaEarth's AI modeling has already been helpful. \"Our partners are already seeing significant benefits, using the data to better classify unmapped ecosystems, understand agricultural and environmental changes, and greatly increase the accuracy and speed of their mapping work,\" the Google DeepMind blog said Wednesday. Satellites deliver a treasure trove of data every day, but all this information varies in its modalities -- such as satellite, radar, simulations and laser mapping -- and how current it is. AlphaEarth can integrate all that data and \"weaves all this information together to analyze the world's land and coastal waters in sharp, 10x10 meter squares.\" AlphaEarth also creates summaries for each of these squares that \"require 16 times less storage space than those produced by other AI systems that we tested and dramatically reduces the cost of planetary-scale analysis,\" Google said. Scientists \"no longer have to rely on a single satellite passing overhead.\""

    "summary": "Over the past few weeks, thousands of video games have been banned, removed and delisted from Steam and Itch.io. The justifications for doing so have been almost comically vague, and at least one highly anticipated title is now unable to be sold despite containing nothing objectionable.\nIt started in early July, when payment processors including Visa, Mastercard and PayPal established new regulations concerning the types of games they would allow to be sold on the PC gaming platforms they support. The exact details of these regulations have not been made public. What we do know is that, in response on July 16, Steam added a sweepingly vague clause to its ruleset banning “certain kinds of adult only content.” Hundreds of games were removed from the platform. On July 24, Itch.io rolled out its own rule change and summarily deindexed every adult and NSFW game it hosted, which amounted to more than 20,000 titles being hidden from search and browse pages. Itch.io is currently auditing this bunch and preparing to introduce new compliance measures for NSFW games.\nAmong the games swept up in this tidal wave of censorship is VILE: Exhumed, the latest project from solo developer Cara Cadaver of Final Girl Games and publisher DreadXP.\n\nVILE: Exhumed takes place in the files and preserved BBS chatrooms of an old PC, as players hunt for clues in the disappearance of adult film actress Candy Corpse. It’s an unsettling psychological experience that’s mainly text-based, and it offers pixelated commentary on misogyny, sexual entitlement and parasocial relationships. VILE: Exhumed has been praised in multiple previews, even earning a place in Six One Indie’s Best of PAX East lineup this May. It was slated to hit Steam on July 22.\nAs DreadXP director Hunter Bond and his team continued preparing the game for launch, they noticed it was taking an abnormally long time for Steam to approve its page. They submitted tickets to Steam asking for a status update, but heard nothing concrete back. The day before VILE: Exhumed was supposed to come out, Cara and DreadXP were forced to announce a delay. And On July 28, Cara announced VILE: Exhumed had been removed from Steam and banned from the platform.\nSteam told Cara that the action was triggered by scenes of “sexual content with depictions of real people,” a description that she said doesn’t apply to her game, since it deals in text and implication. The ban is not eligible for appeal and VILE: Exhumed can not be resubmitted to Steam. This effectively removes it from the mainstream PC gaming conversation, since Steam essentially enjoys a monopoly in the market and there isn’t a competing storefront with the same audience reach in town. Losing Steam access is a huge blow for small developers especially.\nVILE: Exhumed is a deeply personal project for Cara, one that she worked on for years. “I poured myself into this game — it was an incredibly personal story, made up of bits and pieces of my real-life experiences, my real feelings, and was reflective of that for many other people as well,\" Cara told Engadget. \"Silencing a story about violence, entitlement and sexual expression (though the sexual content was all implied) shows the age we are living in, and I deeply worry for storytelling and art.”\nCara Cadaver\nTo put it clearly: Steam removed a solo female developer’s game about misogynistic violence and banned her from attempting to list it ever again, and the platform’s reason for doing so doesn’t make sense to anyone who knows what’s actually in the game. You can decide that for yourself, too: At least one full playthrough of VILE: Exhumed lives happily on YouTube, a site not known for tolerant views on nudity or adult themes. More confusingly, the original version of Cara’s game, VILE, remains available and searchable on Itch.io's storefront, even though it includes much of the same content as Exhumed.\nThis highlights a core issue with Steam and Itchi.io’s sudden and haphazard censorship plans. Vague rules against “adult-only content” leave too much room for interpretation and invite overreach — especially in a society that’s increasingly hostile to marginalized communities — while simultaneously doing very little to protect the audience from whatever demons the payment processors think they have identified. The rollout of the new regulations has been chaotic and already multiple games, including the horror hit Mouthwashing, have been inaccurately identified as casualties of the situation.\nEngadget has reached out to Visa, Mastercard and PayPal for information on what their new policies are and why they're being enacted. Only PayPal has responded with a generic statement that it does not comment on individual accounts. Valve has also not returned requests for comment. Itch.io did not respond to a request for comment in time for publication.\nCara Cadaver\nThis isn’t the first time Visa, Mastercard, PayPal and other major payment processors have targeted online communities for censorship. The current PC gaming bans mirror previous efforts to restrict content on PornHub, OnlyFans and Patreon, to name a few targets. This sort of financial censorship, the Electronic Frontier Foundation says, \"can heavily influence what kind of speech can exist online.”\nThe International Game Developers Association has lodged its fierce opposition to the censorship campaign, and provides avenues for players to contact Visa and Mastercard directly with their concerns.\n“We are alarmed by the vague enforcement of policies delisting and deplatforming legal, consensual, and ethically-developed games, especially from LGBTQ+ and marginalized creators,” the IGDA said. “Developers deserve clear rules, fair warnings, and the right to appeal.”\nIn the case of VILE: Exhumed, Steam is silencing a game that can help combat gender-based sexual violence, in the name of protecting players from being harmed by these same themes. VILE: Exhumed is uncomfortable, confronting, personal and raw — and that’s the beauty of small, independent games. By all accounts, it doesn’t belong in the Steam ban, and it’s also likely not the only game unfairly swept up in the broad censorship campaigns hitting PC platforms, pushed by payment processors.\n\"Indie development for me has been such a beautiful opportunity to create things and tell stories that mean something to me — and I hate that that freedom of expression is being taken from myself and others,\" Cara said. She and DreadXP are cooking up a new distribution plan that doesn’t include Steam.\n\nHave a tip for Jessica? You can reach her by email, Bluesky or send a message to @jesscon.96 to chat confidentially on Signal.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/vile-exhumed-is-an-unjust-casualty-in-steams-sweeping-censorship-campaign-170203493.html?src=rss",

In June, the company stopped letting users add passwords to Authenticator. As of this month, you won't be able to use the autofill password function. And starting Aug. 1, you'll no longer be able to use saved passwords. \"Passkeys use public key cryptography to authenticate users, rather than relying on users themselves creating their own (often weak or reused) passwords to access their online accounts,\" Tomaschek said.

    "full_text": "The Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase on Thursday showed trailers for some games already announced for the Nintendo Switch 2 and revealed a few new ones as well. As the \"0\" implies, this game is a prequel to the first Octopath Traveler game, released on the original Switch in 2019. As the hero, players will have to rebuild their hometown and fight powerful enemies with the help of more than 30 recruitable characters. The Octopath Traveler series has a key feature of having eight playable characters. Each character starts from a different part of the world of Osterra and has their own unique job with abilities, and their story arc plays out and eventually meets up with the other heroes. Another trademark of the franchise is its HD-2D graphics and the Break and Boost battle system. In battles, players have their own Boost points that can be used to quickly Break a character, so they can become unable to fight or can be saved to unleash more damage on enemies who get broken during regular attacks. The result is surprisingly fast combat. In 2022, Square Enix released a free-to-play gacha game for Android and iOS called Octopath Traveler: Champions of the Continent. That game was a prequel to the first Octopath game, so it's unclear how Octopath Traveler 0 will fit into the timeline."

It will help organizations in Asia meet their local data sovereignty requirements when using OpenAI’s products. OpenAI said on Tuesday that it might revise its safety standards if “another frontier AI developer releases a high-risk system without comparable safeguards.” The move shows how commercial AI developers face more pressure to rapidly implement models due to the increased competition. OpenAI wants to incorporate Anthropic’s Model Context Protocol (MCP) into all of its products, including the ChatGPT desktop app. Reliance has proposed selling OpenAI’s models to businesses in India through an application programming interface (API) so they can incorporate AI into their operations. we trained a new model that is good at creative writing (not sure yet how/when it will get released).

Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment will take place far in the past to explain the events leading to The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. The video features Princess Zelda, King Rauru and other characters from the game, and it teases a mystery revolving around an animated suit of armor that could be used by Link. The Hyrule Warriors series is a crossover developed by Koei Tecmo and published by Nintendo. The spinoff started back in 2014 and was a mash-up between Koei Tecmo's popular Dynasty Warriors franchise, featuring Zelda characters with hack-and-slash gameplay. Unlike in the Zelda games, where the action is limited to a few enemies at a time, Hyrule Warriors has playable characters such as Zelda and Link fighting off waves of enemies at once, doing long combos and fighting giant monsters. The last installment of the spinoff series, Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity, came out in 2020 and acted as a prologue for the events of Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. Age of Imprisonment dives deep into the history of Hyrule and takes place during the Imprisoning War, a battle referenced in Tears of the Kingdom. The war was against an enemy known as the Demon King and involved the ancient Zonai race. Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment is set to release sometime this winter for the Switch 2."

    "full_text": "Ford is set to reveal more information about its upcoming low-cost electric vehicles at an event in Kentucky on August 11. And the company is talking a very big game: CEO Jim Farley said Wednesday that the announcement is “a Model T moment” for Ford. Farley made the comments after Ford revealed its electric vehicle division posted a loss of around $1.3 billion in the second quarter of 2025. The company has been deliberately vague about any specifics, but has admitted that the first vehicle to be built on this new low-cost platform will be a mid-size pickup truck set for release in 2027. Ford has said it will build “multiple vehicle styles — for both retail and commercial customers” on the platform, and that these vehicles will feature “personalized digital experiences.” Cheaper models could help Ford, but 2027 is still a long way out. While there are basically no mass-market electric vehicles available in the U.S. at or under $30,000, that likely won’t be the case when Ford’s secretive EVs hit the market in two years. Tesla has said it will start selling a stripped-down (and possibly smaller) Model Y SUV later this year. General Motors is bringing back the Chevy Bolt next year. And Jeff Bezos-backed startup Slate Auto is putting its own low-cost electric pickup on sale as early as late 2026."

    "summary": "This graphic docuseries depicts serious medical emergencies but it may cause some emotional trauma while you watch.",
    "full_text": "Each week, Netflix releases a list of the Top 10 films and TV shows dominating the platform, and for the week of July 21, the new original docuseries Critical: Between Life and Death made a big impression on viewers and it ranked No. While medical shows -- including series like The Pitt, Pulse and ER -- have always been popular, Critical is an unscripted documentary that depicts real-life emergencies as they're happening. That's not to say it's not popular, but my personal theory is that it has proven a little too intense for some people. After a couple of episodes, I couldn't keep pace with all the grim, traumatic events; in fact, I'm shocked I kept watching after the first episode, which featured four people getting thrown from or crushed by a malfunctioning amusement park ride. Being that this is the height of summer and there's a Six Flags nearby that my kids and I frequent regularly, this is not what I wanted to see, and seeing this real incident unfold may have turned me off of fairs and amusement parks for good. I can't be the only person who gets a nagging feeling any time I board any kind of thrill ride that something terrible could happen, that I'm an accomplice to my own Final Destination death scene and here it is, proof that those fears -- while obviously not common -- can come true. We're given a front row seat to all of their treatments as their bodies are cut open, scans are taken and they're assessed for physical and neurological damage. I'm someone who gets grossed out by Dr. Pimple Popper videos, so there were several moments while watching this show where I had to look away. (Spoiler alert: The patients do get an epilogue of sorts where we learn that all of them not only survived but are back to leading healthy, relatively normal lives.) Critical: Between Life and Death is a remarkable show for just how close the filmmakers are allowed to get to such life-threatening action but watching the show made me realize some fears I didn't even know I had."

The company said it will consider data from Google accounts, including types of details users have searched for or categories of videos they have watched on YouTube, to determine the age. If the company’s tool decides that a user is under 18, they would get an email with details about how Google products might change for them. The company will also turn on digital well-being features on YouTube, such as break reminders and “go to bed” notifications when consuming videos late at night. Plus, it will prevent underage users from accessing certain kinds of content — such as content that could trigger body image issues — repeatedly. If users think they have been tagged as an underage account by mistake, they can appeal the decision and prove their age using a photo of their government ID or a selfie. Google rolled out similar measures for YouTube earlier this week, and now the company is experimenting with machine learning-based age gating in the U.S. for Google accounts at large. The company said that it has experimented with age-estimation tech in some markets (without specifying which ones), and it worked well. “Age assurance helps us ensure that adults can access the information and services they need, while also applying the right protections for our younger users. In the U.S., several states have existing or proposed laws around age gating."

    "full_text": "Now it appears that whole milk is gaining popularity again with wellness influencers and others. A few factors could be contributing to whole milk regaining popularity: the concept that \"natural\" is better, people wanting fewer additives in their food and the current Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s \"Make America Healthy Again\" initiative. Chemphobia, along with the appeal-to-nature fallacy (the idea that something \"natural\" is better), makes cow's milk look more enticing because it has fewer ingredients compared to non-dairy milk. Other factors that may make whole milk more appealing are its flavor and taste, since it's creamier, and the higher fat content makes it taste richer compared to plant-based milks. \"I would recommend discussing the volume consumed with a dietitian to ensure meal and snack balance,\" advises Nosek. Parents who give their children cow’s milk should follow the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. Keep in mind that there are certain nutrients you may be missing out on with plant-based options. If you’re not a fan of plant-based milks, but still want to get the benefits of cow’s milk without the upset stomach, Nosek recommends trying out lactose-free options. The sudden popularity surrounding dairy shows that people are starting to show more interest in food options without additives. If you'e planning on making changes to your diet or aren't sure if adding cow's milk is right for you, it's best to consult with a registered dietitian or your doctor first."

Also, I use the US starting price for each iPhone before any carrier discounts are applied. Since its debut in 2007, the standard iPhone has had four price increases and one correction. Up till then, all other standard iPhone models had only a single rear camera. If Apple follows its previous pattern, then the standard iPhone is due for a price increase. Now we just need to wonder how much tariffs and politics might drive the price up even more. But when you factor in everything that's happened this year, it's hard to gauge just how much the price will go up and whether that'll affect just one or two models, or apply across the entire iPhone 17 line. But we do have an unusual-for-Apple clue as to how these tariffs could affect the company. And that was three weeks before Trump threatened another tariff aimed purely at the iPhone.

    "summary": "Brilliant Labs is the startup behind Frame, the open-source smart glasses designed for hackers and other creative types. Today, the company is launching Halo, a new pair of glasses that, predictably for the age we live in, are being sold on the back of their AI features. Halo is a wayfarer-style pair (compared to the Panto-styled Frame) and, if you’re a spectacles wearer, you’ll be able to get prescription lenses in more than 100 countries thank to a partnership with SmartBuyGlasses.\nBrilliant is happy to brag that Halo includes a camera, microphone and bone-conduction speakers in its slender chassis. A natural pitfall of many smart glasses has been the compromises necessary to keep weight down while still offering enough functionality to be useful. Being able to keep the weight to a trim 40 grams is one hell of an achievement, especially given the glasses have a color OLED display and a battery that promises to run for 14 hours on a single charge.\nUnfortunately, instead of a display that overlays onto the lens, Halo \"works\" by projecting into your peripheral vision. I’ll be honest, these displays are becoming more of an irritation the more I use them, especially compared to models that have prisms inside the lenses.\nLast year, Brilliant introduced Noa, its AI agent which it said was designed from the ground up to be used within the context of a pair of glasses. The company says that, when paired with Halo, Noa will be able to talk to you in a way that is natural and intuitive, as if “speaking with a real person.” It claims the secret sauce is in the fact Noa will be able to “understand what it hears and sees within its environment and responds with contextually relevant information in real time.”\nThat’s a lot of braggadocio, especially given the promises that come next about Narrative, its agentic memory system. Narrative will, so it is said, remember the name of a person you met or the details of a conversation you’ve had “years or even decades later.” This will harness the glasses’ optical sensors and microphones to keep tabs on what’s going on from your point of view. And since audio and video are both being constantly recorded, the system will build a “private and personalized knowledge base” about you.\nNaturally, a pair of AI-enabled smart glasses will raise privacy hackles, and Brilliant says Noa will act as a VPN between you and the AI model behind it. Your interactions will be private by default, and users will get a lot of fine-grain privacy controls to ensure they’re happy with how much data they share. Plus, you’ll have voice commands to turn off the microphone, camera and the glasses themselves should you need to. Although if you’re doing something you’d rather not be recorded, the smartest advice is to not wear a pair of AI glasses in the first place. Not to mention that your general concerns about having a database built of every single thing you do in a day (and your social graph) is likely to be easily de-anonymized if necessary.\nBrilliant also promises Halo will enable users to build custom applications for their glasses just from natural language commands. The company says that you just need to tell Noa what you need, and it’ll build an app to serve your purpose “within seconds.”\nPre-orders for Halo are opening today, but shipping isn’t due to begin until late November 2025, with the price set at $299. Compatible prescription lenses will be available to purchase through SmartBuyGlasses, too. The company is also taking great pains to tell users that it will, again, be releasing a limited number of pairs and so anyone interested in owning one will need to get in the line.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wearables/brilliant-labs-launches-its-second-generation-smart-glasses-130000032.html?src=rss",

The company says that, when paired with Halo, Noa will be able to talk to you in a way that is natural and intuitive, as if “speaking with a real person.” It claims the secret sauce is in the fact Noa will be able to “understand what it hears and sees within its environment and responds with contextually relevant information in real time.” Narrative will, so it is said, remember the name of a person you met or the details of a conversation you’ve had “years or even decades later.” This will harness the glasses’ optical sensors and microphones to keep tabs on what’s going on from your point of view. Naturally, a pair of AI-enabled smart glasses will raise privacy hackles, and Brilliant says Noa will act as a VPN between you and the AI model behind it. Although if you’re doing something you’d rather not be recorded, the smartest advice is to not wear a pair of AI glasses in the first place. Not to mention that your general concerns about having a database built of every single thing you do in a day (and your social graph) is likely to be easily de-anonymized if necessary. Brilliant also promises Halo will enable users to build custom applications for their glasses just from natural language commands. Compatible prescription lenses will be available to purchase through SmartBuyGlasses, too. The company is also taking great pains to tell users that it will, again, be releasing a limited number of pairs and so anyone interested in owning one will need to get in the line."

    "summary": "DJI is finally taking on rising rival Insta360 with its first panoramic action camera, the Osmo 360. The company dug into its deep engineering toolkit in an effort to one-up the competition with features like a new sensor design, up to 8K 50 fps 10-bit log recording and a smaller, lighter body.\nIt also matches or beats its rival in other areas, with similar battery life and superior low-light capability. After testing the device in various scenarios like riding around on an e-bike, I’m impressed. Like other 360 cameras, though, the Osmo 360 sacrifices video quality for the convenience of unlimited angles. Plus, DJI’s editing app still needs some work. \n\n\nDesign and features\nInsta360’s cameras made a splash in the action cam world because of a then-unique trait: they capture footage from all angles. That lets you reframe video in any direction so you’re not stuck with a traditional camera's forward-only view. The downside is that quality is reduced from the stated resolution (from 8K to 4K, for example) when footage is \"de-warped\" or flattened to create the final video.\nDJI has so far stayed out of this category, but that's changed with the Osmo 360. Like rival models, it has a lens and sensor on each side, with a display at the back and a record and camera view button below (just like Insta360). There’s also a power button on the side. Other settings and controls are operated from the screen or a smartphone via DJI's Mimo app.\nA key feature is the new 1-inch square sensor designed specifically for panoramic shooting. That allowed DJI to use 25 percent more of the sensor than rival models with rectangular chips, in turn boosting image quality and low-light capability. It also makes the camera more power-efficient.\nThe Osmo 360 is a bit smaller than Insta360's latest model, the X5. Though a bit thicker and wider, the Osmo is substantially shorter at just 83mm compared to the X5 (124.5mm). It's also about 9 percent lighter at 183 grams. All that makes it slightly easier to carry and attach to your body, bikes or other things, though it's still bulkier than a regular action cam.\nAnother bonus with the Osmo 360 is the 105GB of usable built-in storage (plus a microSD slot), compared to… zero for the competition. The battery is the same as the one in the Osmo Action 4 Pro and 5 Pro, so owners of those models already have a compatible battery. It supports up to 120 minutes of 8K 30 fps recording in endurance mode, or 100 minutes in regular mode, similar to the X5's 93/115 minutes. On top of that, battery life on the Osmo 360 can be boosted to 180 minutes with an optional battery extension rod.\nVideo and audio\n\n\n\n\n  DJI\n \n\nWith its new sensor, the Osmo 360 can produce the highest quality video in the 360 category at up to 8K 50 fps, compared to 8K 30 fps on the Insta360 X5 and 6K 30 fps on the Insta360 One RS. That in turn lets creators capture high-quality flat (de-warped) video at up to 4K 50 fps. The new model also offers 10-bit D-LogM recording to boost dynamic range, which is better than the X5's 8-bit I-Log. And if you'd rather record flat video, you can do that in single-lens \"Boost Video\" mode at 4K 120 fps, with a field of view up to 170 degrees.\nWhat's more, I was able to continuously capture 8K at 50 fps for nearly 90 minutes (8K at 30 fps for just over 100 minutes) without any overheating or other issues. That's impressive considering the size of the camera and amount of data being pushed through it.\nThe other benefit is improved low-light capability in all modes. DJI says that the native 8K pixel size is 2.4 micrometers, twice that of the X5, allowing for increased light gathering. If you want to take panoramic photos, the Osmo 360 beats the competition there as well with up to 120MP photos (compared to 72MP for the X5), or it can bin four pixels down to one for 30MP photos with lower noise in low light.\nAfter testing it in day and night conditions, I’m impressed. In good light, it was on par with Insta360's X5 in terms of sharpness and color accuracy. It was superior in tricky contrasty situations, though, with the D-LogM profile boosting dynamic range. Skies, shiny roads and other brightly lit objects showed more detail than the 8-bit I-log video shot with the X5 and shadows were also less washed out.\n\n\nDJI's digital RockSteady stabilization delivered impressively smooth video, even over rough cobblestone roads. And as with other DJI devices, you can let the camera bank with your movements or keep the horizon level (HorizonSteady), although that will come at the cost of some resolution. Stitching was also seamless (except occasionally with objects close to the camera), so I could choose any angle without worrying about distortion.\nNot all was perfect though. As with other 360 models, the Osmo 360 is clearly less sharp than DJI's Action 5 Pro after conversion to 4K flat video. And while low-light performance was indeed very good, digital stabilization became problematic when shooting at night, showing signs of pixelation and video tearing due to motion blur. However, that’s a problem that’s typical with all action cams since they lack optical stabilization.\nLike other DJI Action cams, the Osmo 360 supports the company's Mic 2 and Mic Mini wireless microphones and can record from two of those at the same time via its OsmoAudio direct connection system. You can also connect third-party wireless earbuds as I did with Samsung's Galaxy Buds Pro 2, though only one set at a time.\nDJI’s mics allow for crisp and clear audio, and add a lot of convenience. When paired with the camera, they can also record audio internally to provide a backup copy. Insta360 recently released its own microphone system with the $50 Mic Air that connects directly to the Insta360 X5 and Insta360 Ace Pro 2. However, those models can only use one mic at a time rather than two like the Osmo 360.\nDJI Studio editing\n\n\n\n\n  Steve Dent for Engadget\n \n\nSoftware is an important component of panoramic cameras. On top of editing, they help creators change camera angles and do 360-specific moves. And if you plan to output full panoramic content, it injects that metadata into the final video so that apps like Facebook and YouTube will recognize it correctly.\nA big reason for Insta360’s success has been its excellent Studio app that helps users do all of those things. DJI’s response to that is a new app of its own, which is also called Studio, but its first crack at a 360 editor doesn’t quite measure up to its rival.\nDJI Studio does let you do basic editing, like inserting shots and trimming them. However, it’s not the most intuitive process — it took me too long to figure out how to trim shots before inserting them into the timeline. It’s also a bit buggy: the source display tends to show shots you haven’t selected and the camera angles sometimes randomly change. It also lacks features found on Insta360 Studio like text overlays and transitions.\nThat said, DJI Studio does a good job with its most important task. It’s easy to switch to a new view using keyframes and set animations to improve smoothness. You can then export video in either flat or panoramic formats and import it into apps like Premiere Pro or DaVinci Resolve for the final color correction, effects and titles. All told, DJI Studio is good for a first release, but still needs work compared to its main rival.\nWrap-up\n\n\n\n\n  Steve Dent for Engadget\n \n\nIt took DJI awhile to get a panoramic action cam into the market, but the Osmo 360 was worth the wait. It stacks up well against its main rival, Insta360’s X5, by offering better video quality in low light or high-contrast situations. It’s also easy to use, offers good battery life and trumps its competition with a large amount of built-in storage.\nThe primary drawbacks are slightly lower image quality compared to regular action cams and stabilization that breaks down a bit in low light. The all-new DJI Studio app also needs some work. For a first effort, though, the Osmo 360 is a surprisingly solid rival to Insta360’s X5.\nDJI's Osmo 360 is now available nearly everywhere but the US at €480 for the Standard Combo (around $554) which includes a single battery, protective pouch and rubber lens protector, or €630 ($728) for the Adventure Combo which adds two extra batteries, a charger, a quick release adapter mount and a 1.2m Invisible Selfie Stick. As for US availability, \"it will not be available for sale immediately in the U.S. market through official DJI channels,\" a DJI spokesperson told Engadget. \"We currently do not have an estimated timeline… but we will let you know when we do.\"\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cameras/dji-osmo-360-review-a-capable-action-cam-thats-a-real-threat-to-insta360-120019592.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "We all have so many gadgets now that we use and take with us regularly, and there's a good chance that at least a few of yours support wireless charging. Whether its your phone, wireless earbuds, smartwatch or all three of those things, you can power them up cord-free using a good wireless charger. And if you do plan to rely on wireless power-ups for your most-used devices, a multi-device wireless charger is a good investment. These accessories neatly charge up more than one device simultaneously, without using a bunch of cables that can mess up your space. We've tested a bunch of the latest multi-device wireless chargers; you’ll find out top picks below for the best wireless charging pads, plus some advice on how to choose the right one for your needs.\nTable of contents\n\nBest wireless charging pads\nDo wireless charging pads work with any phone or device?\nHow to pick the best wireless charging pad for your needs\nWireless charging speed and performance\n\nBest wireless charging pads\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDo wireless charging pads work with any phone or device?\nThe short answer is no, but the long and more detailed answer starts with it depends. Regular old wireless charging pucks should work with any device that’s compatible with the same wireless charging standard that the charger supports. Smartphones and other mobile devices that support wireless charging nowadays are likely to support the Qi standard, so double check that your phone or gadget fits that bill and it should work with any Qi wireless charging pad (all of our top picks fall into this category). \nWhen it comes to multi-device chargers, things can get a little tricky. Rather than starting your search looking for the most universally adaptable accessory, consider the devices you have and aspire to own in the future. If you’re an iPhone user with an Apple Watch, you may want to look for a wireless charger that has a Watch pad built in. Ditto if you’re a Samsung phone owner and use a Galaxy Watch. Some earbuds support wireless charging, but you’ll only need an open pad or space on your multi-device charger where you can sit the earbuds in their case down for a power-up.\nThose with iPhone 12s and newer Apple smartphones can take advantage of MagSafe chargers, which magnetically attach to their handsets. Android devices don’t support Apple’s proprietary MagSafe technology, but you can buy a magnetic adapter for pretty cheap that will allow your Samsung or Pixel phone to work with MagSafe multi-device chargers. You’ll also need that to get full Qi2 goodness with newer Android phones like the Galaxy S25 series, which are “Qi2 ready,” but since they do not have magnets built in, aren’t precisely Qi2 compliant.\nHow to pick the best wireless charging pad for your needs\n\n\n\n\nEven without a charging cable to worry about, you’re probably buying a multi-device wireless charger with one location in mind. It might sit on your nightstand or on your desk. Not everyone buys a charger just for themselves, though; you might want to use one as a shared station for you and a partner.\nIf the charger will sit on your nightstand, you’ll likely want a compact, stable unit that won’t swallow all your free space or tumble to the floor (and if it does fall, one with enough durability to survive). Some may prefer a lay-flat design if your phone screen has a tendency to keep you awake at night. Others might use their phone as their alarm clock, in which case you may want a stand that keeps the screen within reach and eyeshot. This is also the preferred design if you use Standby Mode on iPhones.\nA vertical orientation may be best for a charger that lives on your desk so you can more easily check notifications throughout the day. Will the charger sit on a low table? Horizontal charger pads may make it easier to grab your devices in a hurry. Travel chargers should fold up or otherwise protect the pads while they’re in your bag. And, yes, aesthetics count. You may want something pretty if it’s likely to sit in a posh room where guests will see it.\nFor vehicles, consider a wireless car charger if you frequently need to top off your device on the go. These chargers combine convenience with functionality, ensuring your phone stays powered while you’re navigating and taking calls at the same time. We also heavily recommend a magnetic charger so there’s less of a chance your phone will go flying into the passenger’s seat the next time you hit a pothole.\nWireless charging speed and performance\nIt’s no secret that wireless charging is slower than wired, and powering multiple devices adds a new wrinkle. As these chargers often have to support a wide range of hardware, you’ll have to forget about the fastest, device-specific options from brands like Google, OnePlus and Samsung.\nThat’s not to say these will be slow, but there just isn’t much separating them on the charging speed front. As a general rule, the quickest multi-device chargers tend to top out at 15W for phones. It’s rare that you’ll find a truly slow-as-molasses example, mind you. Even some of the most affordable options we’ve seen will recharge your phone at a reasonable 7.5W or 10W, and the 5W for other devices like wireless earbuds is more than enough.\nIf you’re only docking overnight or while you work, speed won’t make a huge difference. Just be sure that whatever you buy is powerful enough for a phone in a case. Some chargers may also include an AC adapter in the box. If not, make sure you’re using one with the right power level to get the fastest charge.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-multi-device-wireless-charging-pads-120557582.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Whether you're listening to playlists on your daily commute or zoning out with a podcast at home, wireless headphones can make your audio experience much more comfortable. With no cords to untangle or get caught on your bag, they’re a great pick for anyone who wants convenience without compromising on sound quality. If comfort and immersive audio are high on your priority list, over-ear wireless headphones are often the way to go — they wrap around your ears to help block out the world and deliver rich detailed sound that earbuds can sometimes miss.There’s a wide range of over-ear wireless headphones to choose from, whether you want active noise cancellation, long battery life or a comfy fit for marathon listening sessions. Of course, if you're after something a little more compact or tailored to a specific use case, we also have you covered with our buying guides for the best earbuds, the best gaming headsets and the best budget earbuds. But if wireless headphones with top-tier sound and a comfortable, over-ear design are what you're after, read on — we’ve tested the top options to help you find the right pair.\nTable of contents\n\nBest wireless headphones for 2025\nHow to choose the best wireless headphones for you\nHow we test over-ear headphones\nOther wireless headphones we tested\nWireless headphones FAQs\n\nBest wireless headphones for 2025\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nHow to choose the best wireless headphones for you\nWhen it comes to shopping for a good pair of wireless headphones, the first thing you’ll need to decide on is wear style. Do you prefer on-ear or over-ear headphones? For the purposes of our buyer’s guide, we focus on the over-ear style as that’s what most noise-canceling headphones are nowadays. Sure, you can find on-ear models with ANC, but over-ear designs are much more effective at blocking sound. Speaking of noise cancellation, you’ll want to determine early on if you even want that. If you frequently crank up the beats in noisy environments, you’ll want to not only make sure it’s there, but also make sure it’s good, preferably with adaptive ANC. If you plan to use your new headphones in quieter spaces, skipping ANC can save you some money. \nThe next area to consider is features. We recommend trying to get the most bang for your buck, but as you’re shopping around you should determine which items are must-haves and what you can live without. And don’t take basic things like automatic pausing and Bluetooth multipoint connectivity for granted, as not all companies include them. We also suggest reading reviews to see how well a company’s more advanced features work. This will help you decide if those are something you’re willing to (likely) pay extra for. Keep an eye on better battery life estimates to avoid disappointment, as some manufacturers promise more hours than real-world testing delivers. And don’t be easily swayed by lofty promises about call quality without verifying them.\nSound can be subjective, so we recommend trying before you buy if at all possible. We understand this isn’t easy at a time when we’re doing most of our shopping online. But trying on a set of headphones and listening to them for a few minutes can save you from an expensive case of buyer’s remorse. We also recommend paying attention to things like Spatial Audio, Dolby Atmos, 360 Reality Audio and other immersive formats. Not all headphones support them, so you’ll want to make sure a perspective pair does if that sort of thing excites you. If you plan to use your headphones for other media besides music, checking for latency is also a must — some delay can impact playback for things like movies or games, even if most true wireless headphones now offer minimal lag.\nHow we test over-ear headphones\nThe primary way we test wireless headphones is to wear them as much as possible. We prefer to do this over a one- to two-week period, but sometimes embargoes don’t allow it. During this time, we listen to a mix of music and podcasts, while also using the earbuds to take both voice and video calls. Since battery life for headphones can be 30 hours or more, we drain the battery with looping music and the volume set at a comfortable level (usually around 75 percent). Due to the longer battery estimates, we’ll typically power the headphones off several times and leave them during a review. This simulates real-world use and keeps us from having to constantly monitor the process for over 24 straight hours.\nTo judge the best Bluetooth headphones, we focus on higher-quality audio by listening to a variety of genres and paying close attention to how each style sounds. We also test at both low and high volumes to check for consistency in the tuning. To assess the quality of phone calls, we’ll record audio samples with the headphones’ microphones as well as have third parties call us.\nWhen it comes to features, we do a thorough review of companion apps, testing each feature as we work through the software. Any holdovers from previous models are double checked for improvements or regression. If the headphones we’re testing are an updated version of a previous model, we’ll spend time getting reacquainted with the older set. Ditto for the closest competition for each new set of headphones that we review.\nOther wireless headphones we tested\nAirPods Max\nApple’s AirPods Max are premium, well-designed over-ear headphones that incorporate all of the best features you find on standard AirPods: solid noise cancelation, spatial audio and easy Siri access. However, their $550 starting price makes them almost prohibitively expensive, even for Apple users. There are better options available at lower prices, but if you can pick up the AirPods Max at a steep discount, they might be worthwhile for the biggest Apple fans among us.\nDyson On-Trac\nThe On-Trac headphones have an almost infinitely customizable design, and that’s what’s most unique about them. The sound profile offers some nice detail, but lacks dynamic range overall. ANC is average at best and there aren’t any advanced features that will make your life easier. Well, except for the hearing health monitor which is actually handy. All told, that’s not a lot in a set of $500 headphones.\nSonos Ace\nThe Sonos Ace is an excellent debut for the company’s first headphones. The combination of refined design, great sound quality and home theater tricks creates a unique formula. However, ANC performance is just okay and key functionality is still in the works for many users.\nSony ULT Wear\nIf most headphones don’t have the level of bass you desire, the ULT Wear is an option to consider. The low-end thump isn’t for everyone, but there are also plenty of handy features and a refined look to make the $200 set more compelling than many in this price range.\nSony WH-CH720N\nWhile the WH-CH720N are a great affordable option, we prefer the Audio-Technica in the budget category. Sony’s cans are lightweight with good sound quality, but ANC struggles at times and they’re made with a lot of plastic.\nBeats Studio Pro\nThe Studio Pro lacks basic features like automatic pausing, and multipoint connectivity is only available on Android. Moreover, they’re not very comfortable for people with larger heads. Overall sound quality is improved, though, and voice performance on calls is well above average.\nBose QuietComfort Ultra headphones\nBose’s latest flagship model has a lot to offer, but its trademark Immersive Audio feature can be inconsistent across different types of music. There’s still world-class ANC, excellent comfort and a clearer transparency mode, but for the price, the non-Ultra model is a better choice right now.\nMaster & Dynamic MH40 (2nd gen)\nThe MH40 are a great set of headphones if you favor crisp, clear and natural sound that isn’t overly tuned. This pair showcases the company’s affinity for leather and metal too, but limited customization and short battery life for non-ANC cans kept this set from making the cut.\nBowers & Wilkins Px8\nThe company’s trademark pristine sound is on display here, but the Px8 are more expensive and not nearly as comfortable as the Px7 S2.\nWireless headphones FAQs\nHow can you tell the quality of wireless headphones?\nI typically look at three factors: design, sound quality and features. In terms of design, I’m usually looking to see if the build quality of the headphones feels cheap and plasticky. Plenty of companies use plastic, but they can do so in a way that doesn’t look or feel like budget models. For sound quality, I want to hear a nice, even tuning where highs, mids and lows are all well represented. No overly boomy bass or scooped out mids. I also want good clarity where you can pick up fine details and an open, immersive soundstage. Features is typically a distant third, but if a company doesn’t cover basic functionality (automatic pausing, transparency mode, multipoint Bluetooth, etc.) it can be an indication of overall quality. \nHow do I choose the best quality wireless headphones?\n“Best” can be pretty subjective, but I always recommend going to a place where you can listen to the headphones you’re thinking about buying before you commit. Sometimes this isn’t possible, so you’ll want to check return policies. I also recommend doing some research to determine what your priorities are in a new set. Are you an audiophile who wants the best sound quality? Is powerful active noise cancellation (ANC) the most important? Would you rather have conveniences like automatic pausing?\nWhich brand has the best wireless headphones?\nSony consistently tops our list with its 1000X line. This is mostly due to the combination of sound quality, ANC performance and the truckload of features these headphones pack in. I’ll be the first to tell you that there are better sounding options and other companies, like Bose, offer more effective noise cancellation. But when you add everything up, no one comes close to the full slate of tools Sony puts in its premium headphone line.\nDo expensive wireless headphones sound better?\nExorbitant price tags don’t mean better audio quality. Bowers & Wilkins’ headphones are on the high end for wireless noise-canceling models and they sound amazing. However, Audio-Technica’s M50xBT2 is much more affordable and doesn’t have ANC, but these headphones have a warm, natural sound profile that I find very inviting. At the end of the day, it will come down to personal preference, but you don’t need to spend a lot to find great headphones.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/best-headphones-wireless-bluetooth-120543205.html?src=rss",

We spent two weeks test-driving it — you can check out our detailed hands-on iOS 26 preview, or you can try it out yourself by downloading and installing the public beta, available now. Before you dive in, we'll help you answer this question: Will my iPhone be able to run iOS 26?\nLast year, Apple didn't nix any iPhones from its eligibility list, but that's not the case for 2025 — a few models are getting cut this time. All iPhone 8 models and the iPhone X were the last to get the boot in 2023, and this year the 2018 models are getting left behind.

Basically, if you have an iPhone that was announced in 2019 or later, you're in the clear:\n\niPhone SE (second generation or later)\niPhone 11\niPhone 11 Pro\niPhone 11 Pro Max\niPhone 12\niPhone 12 mini\niPhone 12 Pro\niPhone 12 Pro Max\niPhone 13\niPhone 13 mini\niPhone 13 Pro\niPhone 13 Pro Max\niPhone 14\niPhone 14 Plus\niPhone 14 Pro\niPhone 14 Pro Max\niPhone 15\niPhone 15 Plus\niPhone 15 Pro\niPhone 15 Pro Max\niPhone 16e\niPhone 16\niPhone 16 Plus\niPhone 16 Pro\niPhone 16 Pro Max\n\nWhat if I don't want to buy a new iPhone?\nIf you want to continue using your older iPhone that isn't supported by iOS 26, that's fine. However, you'll miss out on security updates which could potentially put your phone at risk for malware and other threats. Additionally, some apps may stop working if they require a certain version of iOS or later. And of course, you won't be able to access the latest features iOS 26 offers.\nWhen will iOS 26 become available?\nApple usually rolls out its latest iOS in mid-September, just a few days before the new iPhones hit store shelves. Last year, it released iOS 18 on Monday, Sept. 16. Expect a confirmation of the release date at the iPhone 17 event, expected in early September. \niOS 26 features we're excited about\nLiquid Glass design: Your home screen is getting revamped with new app icons, including dark mode and all-clear options. You'll also notice buttons with a new floating design. Liquid Glass was designed to make all of Apple's OSes more cohesive.\nPhone app redesign: You'll finally be able to scroll through contacts, recent calls and voicemail messages all on one screen. It also comes with a new feature called Hold Assist that'll notify you when an agent comes to the phone so you can avoid the elevator music.\nLive Translate: iOS 26 is bringing the ability to have a conversation via phone call or text message with someone who speaks another language. Live Translate will translate your conversation in real time. \nPolls feature: Coming to group messages in the Messages app, chat members will be able to create polls. This can help prevent the unwanted 30+ messages when it comes to deciding which restaurant you're meeting at this weekend.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/apple-ios-26-is-your-iphone-compatible-heres-a-list-which-devices-can-download-it-today-191854768.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Earlier today, Mark Zuckerberg shared a rambling memo outlining his vision to build AI \"superintelligence.\" In the memo, Zuckerberg hinted that the pursuit of more powerful AI might require the company to be more selective in what it open sources.\nCiting \"safety concerns\" he wrote that Meta would need to be \"rigorous\" about such decisions. The line stood out to many as Zuckerberg — who once said \"fuck that\" in reference to closed platforms — has made open source central to Meta's AI strategy.\nDuring Meta's second quarter earnings call, Zuckerberg further acknowledged there could be a shift, though he downplayed the significance of it. Here's what he said when asked if his thinking had changed.\nI don't think that our thinking has particularly changed on this. We've always open sourced some of our models and not open sourced everything that we've done. So I would expect that we will continue to produce and share leading open source models. I also think that there are a couple of trends that are playing out. One is that we're getting models that are so big that they're just not practical for a lot of other people to use, so we kind of wrestle with whether it's productive or helpful to share that, or if that's really just primarily helping competitors or something like that. So I think that there's, there's that concern. And then obviously, as you approach real superintelligence, I think there's a whole different set of safety concerns that I think we need to take very seriously, that I wrote about in my note this morning. But I think the bottom line is I would expect that we will continue open sourcing work. I expect us to continue to be a leader there, and I also expect us to continue to not open source everything that we do, which is a continuation of kind of what we, what we've been, been kind of working on.\nThat's notably different than what he wrote almost exactly a year ago in a different memo titled \"Open Source AI is the Path Forward.\" In that, even longer note, he said that open source is crucial for both Meta and developers.\n\"People often ask if I’m worried about giving up a technical advantage by open sourcing Llama, but I think this misses the big picture,\" he wrote. \"I expect AI development will continue to be very competitive, which means that open sourcing any given model isn’t giving away a massive advantage over the next best models at that point in time.\"\nHe also argued that open source is safer. \"There is an ongoing debate about the safety of open source AI models, and my view is that open source AI will be safer than the alternatives. As long as everyone has access to similar generations of models – which open source promotes – then governments and institutions with more compute resources will be able to check bad actors with less compute.\"\nTo be clear, Zuckerberg said the company would continue to open source some of its work. But he seems to be laying the groundwork for a future in which Meta's \"superintelligence\" could be a lot less open.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/is-mark-zuckerberg-flip-flopping-on-open-source-ai-231310567.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Fable, a startup designing tools to generate animated TV shows from scratch, is launching an AI-powered streaming service this week, Variety reports. The service is called Showrunner, and it will allow subscribers to generate scenes, view content created for Fable's in-house AI-generated animated shows and even insert themselves into the animations they generate.\nShowrunner is launching in alpha, and based on Fable's website, you'll primarily interact with it through the company's Discord to start. Per Variety, subscribers will pay anywhere from $10 to $20 month for credits that can be exchanged for the ability to generate new animated scenes. The word \"scenes\" is key here. While Fable is launching with a couple of distinct animated shows, they're really more like collections of worlds and characters that subscribers can use to create new scenes. \nThose include Exit Valley, a Family Guy-inspired riff on the culture of Silicon Valley, and Everything is Fine, a comedy about a husband and wife who are stranded in an alternate world and trying to reunite. The company's goal is bigger than than just original content. Fable founder Edward Saatchi imagines a Disney-owned \"Toy Story of AI\" where subscribers could generate endless new scenes of Buzz and Woody interacting. For now, though, interested Showrunner users have to settle with knockoffs.\nEngadget was able to preview an earlier version of Fable's Showrunner AI models back in 2019 that capably generated new South Park episodes based on audio inputs. The startup's model was able to create a watchable copy of the show's style even back then, which might be why Amazon has invested an undisclosed amount in Fable as part of the launch of Showrunner. \nWhile creatives remain skeptical to downright antagonist towards AI, companies have started using it more publicly in production. For example, Netflix recently touted its use of generative AI in its original show The Eternaut. Even if adoption grows, though, that doesn't really clarify whether the average film or TV viewer has any desire to generate content on their own, especially if it's as rough-around-the-edges as most AI-generated media is. Besides being a public demonstration of Fable's tech, Showrunner seems like a test to see if that desire is even there.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/showrunner-an-ai-powered-streaming-service-launches-in-alpha-this-week-204042241.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "It was easy to view Substack's 2023 Nazi controversy as a kicked can that could turn up again. Well, white supremacist content led to another headache for the company this week. User Mag reported on Tuesday that the app sent a push alert to some users promoting a Nazi newsletter. The company told Engadget the notification was an \"extremely offensive and disturbing\" error.\nThe Substack newsletter in question describes itself as \"a National Socialist weekly newsletter.\" It includes \"opinions and news important to the National Socialist and White Nationalist Community.\" The far-right blog has a mere 757 subscribers. (That's a drop in the ocean compared to, say, Heather Cox Richardson's 2.6 million, George Saunders' 312,000 and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's 236,000.)\nGiven the newsletter's offensive content and relatively paltry audience, this wouldn't seem like something to promote. According to the company, it didn't mean to. \"We discovered an error that caused some people to receive push notifications they should never have received,\" a Substack spokesperson told Engadget.\n\"In some cases, these notifications were extremely offensive or disturbing,\" the statement continued. \"This was a serious error, and we apologize for the distress it caused. We have taken the relevant system offline, diagnosed the issue and are making changes to ensure it doesn't happen again.\"\nEngadget asked Substack for extra details or context about how the accident happened. It didn't have further comment at the time of publication. We'll update this story if we find out more.\nThe newsletter in questionSubstack\nUser Mag reports that those who clicked on the Nazi blog's profile received recommendations for a similar one. That one had a larger audience of 8,600 subscribers.\nOne reason social users were quick to pounce on the latest incident: It provides a symbolic callback to Substack's 2023 Nazi shitstorm. That's when The Atlantic dug up \"scores\" of white-supremacist, neo-Confederate and Nazi newsletters on the platform. Some were monetized.\nSubstack's policy is one of anti-censorship. \"I just want to make it clear that we don't like Nazis either — we wish no one held those views,\" Substack cofounder Hamish McKenzie wrote in December 2023. \"But some people do hold those and other extreme views. Given that, we don't think that censorship (including through demonetizing publications) makes the problem go away — in fact, it makes it worse.\"\nAfter weeks of negative press coverage and prominent authors leaving the platform, Substack relented… sort of. On one hand, the company removed \"some\" pro-Nazi publications. However, it did so without changing its policies. Instead, it said five publications violated its existing content guidelines. Specifically, they broke rules prohibiting \"incitements to violence based on protected classes.\"\nSome critics didn't believe that was enough. The Platformer's Casey Newton, a prominent voice who left Substack during the episode, thought the company needed to take more responsibility. \"Every platform hosts its share of racists, white nationalists and other noxious personalities,\" Newton wrote in early 2024. \"In some very real sense, there is no escaping them online. But there ought to be ways to see them less; to recommend them less; to fund them less. Other platforms have realized this as they’ve grown up. Here’s hoping Substack does the same.\"\nSubstack has since found its footing as a haven for independent content creators. Numerous journalists looking to build an audience sans traditional media have flocked to it. (Among others, that list includes Tina Brown, Jim Acosta, Terry Moran and Jennifer Rubin.) In recent years, Substack has added a Twitter-like social feature, live video and TikTok-esque vertical video.\nThe company said it had its biggest week during the 2024 presidential election with an 82 percent boost in paid subscriptions. It recently raised $100 million in funding.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/apps/substack-accidentally-sent-push-alerts-promoting-a-nazi-publication-191004115.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "LinkedIn quietly changed the language of its hateful content policy this week. The update, the company's first change in three years according to the site's own changelog, removed a line that stated the company prohibits the misgendering and deadnaming of transgender individuals.\nThe change, which was first noted by the organization Open Terms Archive, was the only modification to the \"hateful and derogatory content\" policy. An archived version of the rules includes \"misgendering or deadnaming of transgender individuals\" as an example of prohibited content under the policy. That line was removed on July 28, 2025.\nOpen Terms and other groups have interpreted the change to mean that LinkedIn is rolling back protections for transgender people.\nA LinkedIn spokesperson told Engadget the company's underlying policies hadn't changed despite the updated wording. The company's rules still reference \"gender identity\" as a protected characteristic. \"We regularly update our policies,\" the company said in a statement. \"Personal attacks or intimidation toward anyone based on their identity, including misgendering, violates our harassment policy and is not allowed on our platform.\" The company didn't provide an explanation for the change.\nAdvocacy groups say they are alarmed by the move. In a statement, GLAAD denounced LinkedIn's update and suggested it was part of a broader pattern of tech platforms loosening rules meant to protect vulnerable users. “LinkedIn’s quiet decision to retract longstanding, best-practice hate speech protections for transgender and nonbinary people is an overt anti-LGBTQ move — and one that should alarm everyone,\" a spokesperson for the organization said in a statement. \"Following Meta and YouTube earlier this year, yet another social media company is choosing to adopt cowardly business practices to try to appease anti-LGBTQ political ideologues at the expense of user safety.\"\nEarlier this year, Meta rewrote its rules to allow its users to claim LGBTQ people are mentally ill. The company also added a term associated with discrimination and dehumanization to its community standards and has so far declined to remove it even after its Oversight Board recommended it do so. YouTube also quietly updated its rules this year to remove a reference to \"gender identity\" from its hate speech policies. The platform denied that it had changed any of its rules in practice, suggesting to User Mag the move \"was part of regular copy edits to the website.\"\nHave a tip for Karissa?

    "summary": "After largely focusing Google I/O 2025 on the ways the company wants Gemini to change everything from searching the web to filmmaking, Google is finally ready to launch new hardware. The next Made by Google event is on the books for August 20, and Google has already confirmed what at least one of its new Pixel 10 phones will look like.\nGoogle remains as leak-prone as ever, so nearly all the new hardware the company is expected to announce has all ready been reported on in one form or another. With that in mind and after sifting through what has leaked, here's what Google will show off at the Pixel 10 launch even in New York City on August 20.\nPixel 10, 10 Pro, 10 Pro XL and 10 Pro Fold\nAndroid Headlines / Onleaks \nGoogle's invitation for the event says that the company is sharing \"the latest on our Pixel phones, watches, buds and more,” which more or less confirms the company will introduce a slate of products that's similar to what it launched in 2024. That means a Pixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro, Pixel 10 Pro XL and Pixel 10 Pro Fold are absolutely on the menu.\nGoogle's tease of the Pixel 10 confirmed what leaked renders have already signaled: the company isn't abandoning the new design language the Pixel 9 established. The pill-shaped camera bump and flat front display will still be present on the Pixel 10, and the real changes will be in the details, like for example, how the flat sides of the Pixel 10 join with the phone's back.\nThose subtle changes will apparently also include the thickness of the Pixel 10s. While both the Pixel 10, 10 Pro, 10 Pro XL and 10 Pro Fold will use the same sized OLED screens as their Pixel 9 counterparts, they'll be housed in thicker and heavier bodies, according to Android Headlines. Google's new Pixels are also supposed to come in new colors. The Pixel 10 will come in \"Frost\" (a royal blue), \"Lemongrass\" (a yellow), \"Indigo\" (a light purple) and \"Obsidian\" (a dark gray), while the Pixel 10 Pro / Pro XL will come in Obsidian, \"Porcelain\" (off-white), \"Moonstone\" (a bluish gray) and \"Jade\" (a light green). Less information is known about the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, though recent leaks suggest it'll come in Moonstone and Jade, as well.\nAndroid Headlines\nThe most visible external change that'll be introduced on the Pixel 10 is the addition of a new telephoto camera. The new telephoto camera is a 11-megapixel 5x telephoto, Android Authority reports, similar to the one on the Pixel 9 Pro Fold. Meanwhile, the Pixel 10 Pro and 10 Pro XL are expected to feature a 50-megapixel wide, 48-megapixel ultrawide, 48-megapixel telephoto and 48-megapixel selfie cameras. The Pixel 10 Pro Fold could feature a different lineup, with a similar main camera, but 12-megapixel ultrawide and telephoto cameras, and 11-megapixel selfie cameras.\nInside the new phones, Google is laying the groundwork for future performance gains with a new Tensor G5 chip. It's likely be much more power-efficient thanks to the company switching to a 3nm design produced by TSMC. Reports suggest the chip might not be all that different in terms of raw power, but the Tensor G5 is likely designed to be extra capable when it comes to using local AI features.\nWhile global tariff turmoil could justify a price increase, Google is reportedly keeping things consistent with the Pixel 10 family. They'll offer similar storage options, come in at the same prices and include the same freebies and incentives. The Pixel 10 will come with six months of Google AI Pro and Fitbit Premium, along with three months of YouTube Premium. Meanwhile the Pixel 10 Pro models will get a year of Google AI Pro, six months of Fitbit Premium and three months of YouTube Premium. The prices and storage options for the phones should breakout down as follows:\n\nPixel 10: 128GB ($799), 256GB ($899)\nPixel 10 Pro: 128GB ($999), 256GB ($1,099), 512GB ($1,219), 1TB ($1,449)\nPixel 10 Pro XL: 256GB ($1,199), 512GB ($1,319), 1TB ($1,549)\nPixel 10 Pro Fold: 256GB ($1,799), 512GB ($1,919), 1TB ($2,149)\n\nPixel Watch 4\n91mobiles / Onleaks\nThe third time was the charm for the Pixel Watch 3, so the main task Google has with the Pixel Watch 4 is to not squander the solid base it already has. Leaks for the company's new smartwatches have been limited so far, but renders of the Pixel Watch 4 shared by 91mobiles do suggest Google has a few changes planned.\nNamely, much like the company's phones, the new Pixel Watch seems like it'll be a little bit thicker and come with smaller bezels. The Pixel Watch 4 should be available to purchase in the same 41mm and 45mm sizes as before, but in new colors — including a Moonstone option to match the Pixel 10 — and with a brighter display.\nThe thicker frame will also help the smartwatch fit a larger battery and a new wireless charging system, according to Android Headlines. Rather than charge through a puck with pogo pins like the Pixel Watch 3, the Pixel Watch 4 will use a wireless charging stand that could fill it up even faster.\nBeyond that, Google has already indicated how Wear OS is evolving. The new Wear OS 6 update is debuting on the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8, and will presumably be available on the Pixel Watch 4 at launch. It includes built-in access to Gemini, among other tweaks. Given Google also manages the Fitbit Premium subscription, it wouldn't be all that surprising if the Pixel Watch 4 gets some exclusive fitness tracking features, too.\nPixel Buds 2a\nBilly Steele for Engadget\nGoogle launched the Pixel Buds Pro 2 last year, and it typically doesn't update its premium earbuds on a yearly cadence. So instead, Tom's Guide reports Google might pair the Pixel 10 with the Pixel Buds Pro 2 in a new color, and save its new hardware announcements for a sequel to the Pixel Buds A-series called the Pixel Buds 2a.\nUnlike the company's premium wireless earbuds, the A-series Pixel Buds have historically skimped on things like active noise cancellation to hit a lower price. There's little reporting on where Google will take the Pixel Buds 2a, but you can expect the new earbuds to come in some of the new colors being introduced on the Pixel 10.\nPixelsnap\nThe Qi2 wireless charging standard is available for all phone makers to use, but it hasn't been widely adopted among Android phone makers. Qi2 uses magnets to offer improved charging speeds, just like Apple's MagSafe, and the Pixel 10 could mark Google's adoption of Qi2 through a new feature called \"Pixelsnap.\"\nA report from Android Authority suggests the Pixel 10 will include the necessary magnets to make Qi2 happen, and will be introduced alongside a lineup of Pixelsnap accessories. New leaked images showing a Pixel 10 charging with a magnetic charging puck that looks a lot like Apple's MagSafe charger adds even more credence to the rumor.\nIf you need even more convincing, the Wireless Power Consortium has announced that its faster Qi2 25W charging is coming to \"major Android phones.\" It would make sense if Google's Pixel 10s were included considering runs Android itself.\nGemini and other exclusive software features\nGemini is Google's current favorite, and the company is pushing the AI assistant everywhere it makes sense. The last few Pixel Drops — Google's regular Pixel-focused software updates — have primarily included Gemini features. It would make sense for Google to include a few more software exclusives on the Pixel 10.\nGoogle is hosting the Pixel 10 launch event on August 20 at 1PM ET / 10AM ET. The company has invited press to attend in person, and you can read coverage of everything Google announces right here on Engadget.\nUpdate, July 30, 2:30PM ET: Added information on pricing for the Pixel 10 lineup and new details on Qi2 support.\nUpdate, July 24, 3:44PM ET: Added details on the Pixel Watch 4's display, new colors and charging stand.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/google-pixel-10-launch-what-we-expect-to-see-at-the-made-by-google-event-on-august-20-214510537.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Of all the new iOS 26 features that Apple previewed at WWDC in June, AirPods updates were only briefly mentioned. Studio-quality audio recording and improved call clarity got top billing, while the addition of a camera remote control was also quickly discussed. However, when the beta software arrived last week, it turned out there were actually more features than described at the event, making this a meatier update for Apple’s recent AirPods than initially indicated. I’ve spent some time testing all of the new tools, so here’s what you can expect when you decide to use them.\nHow to get the latest AirPods features\nAll of these updates are available for AirPods that have the H2 chip. Those include AirPods 4, AirPods 4 with ANC and AirPods Pro 2. You’ll have to download the public betas of both iOS 26 and the latest AirPods firmware to use these features. If you’re not feeling adventurous, all of these items will arrive this fall when the final versions of Apple’s OS updates roll out. That’s likely to happen for iOS and AirPods in early September, around the time the new crop of iPhones debuts.\nStudio-quality audio recording\nApple may have framed the voice quality improvements on its AirPods as a boost for creators, but I’d argue the upgrade will be a welcome change for all. Sure, people who create content will benefit considerably from what Apple calls “studio-quality audio recording,” but the improved performance in noisy environments is something anyone will appreciate.\nThe company hasn’t offered much detail on exactly what it did to produce higher-quality audio, only describing the change in an initial press release as the result of a mix of the AirPods’ H2 chip, beamforming microphones and computational audio. That last update is likely doing the heavy lifting here, assisted by Apple’s audio chip, of course. I asked Apple for more specifics, but have yet to hear back.\nImproved audio recording is available across iPhones, iPads and Macs, working in apps like Camera, Voice Memos, Messages (for dictation), Webex and more. Apple also says there’s upgraded vocal sound quality for calls, offering “more natural vocal texture and clarity” for Phone, FaceTime and other CallKit-enabled apps. As the voice upgrades are the most notable new features, I was eager to test them, and have spent the last several weeks doing just that (via the developer beta).\nBilly Steele for Engadget\nIf you’re recording in a quiet room, you’ll notice that enhanced texture and clarity Apple promised. In my samples captured in Voice Memos, there’s not a huge difference between new and old firmware, but there is a noticeable one. The bigger improvement came when I moved to a noisy spot. Here, Apple dialed back its noise suppression in favor of voice clarity. While you’ll hear the slight roar of background noise in my audio clip, I actually sound better overall. That’s a trade I’ll bet many users will gladly make over the highly processed, digital-sounding results AirPods used to give us in less-than-ideal surroundings.\nI also noticed that both of my samples with the new software were captured with a 48kHz sample rate. This isn’t new for AirPods audio recording/quality per se, but before this update some of my clips were still 24kHz — like my noisy sample with the old firmware. It seems like Apple is now defaulting to 48kHz as part of the overall sound boost, but that’s currently unclear and is something else I’ve asked the company for more info about.\nCamera remote\nThe less exciting, but equally handy update for AirPods that Apple announced at WWDC is the addition of a camera remote control. Since newer AirPods have either force sensors or touch controls on their stems, the company saw fit to let you use those to take a photo or start and stop video recording. All of these tasks are done with either one press or a press and hold (you select which one you prefer when you enable the camera remote function).\nFor photos, you get a three-second countdown before your device snaps the picture. This gives you ample time to put your hand down after pressing the AirPods stem so you don’t ruin the selfie. For video, there’s no countdown, but there is a second or two delay before the recording starts. So, if you’re quick about it, you can get your hand away from your ear before showtime. However, you’ll still have to reach for an AirPod or your phone when the time comes to stop recording, so there will be some editing to do there. This all works well, but just remember you have to enable the camera remote feature as it’s not activated by default after the firmware update.\nSleep pausing and CarPlay switching\nBilly Steele/Engadget\nMost AirPods users have probably fallen asleep with one or both of the earbuds in their ears. Apple’s update will add automatic pausing when you’ve dozed off to help you not miss much of your TV show or podcast you were watching or listening to. However, it’s unclear how this works. All we know is it’s a simple on-or-off switch, and it’s disabled by default. Some have speculated that it uses sleep data from the Apple Watch, but that hasn’t been confirmed. Since AirPods have accelerometers, it’s possible the feature may rely on detecting movement, but I’ve asked for a firm answer on what’s going on here.\nAnother item on the list of AirPods updates is automatic switching for CarPlay. This is supposed to seamlessly transfer the audio to your car’s infotainment system from the earbuds when your phone connects to your vehicle. Again, there hasn’t been much discussion of this, and my attempts to trigger it were unsuccessful. That may be due to the fact that it requires wireless CarPlay, but I’m not seeing specific options for this in my AirPods settings. I’m waiting for more info from Apple on this feature too, and hopefully I’ll have more details to add to my observations soon.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/ios-26-updates-for-airpods-preview-enhanced-audio-recording-camera-remote-and-more-173036046.html?src=rss",
    "full_text": "Of all the new iOS 26 features that Apple previewed at WWDC in June, AirPods updates were only briefly mentioned. Studio-quality audio recording and improved call clarity got top billing, while the addition of a camera remote control was also quickly discussed. All of these updates are available for AirPods that have the H2 chip. I asked Apple for more specifics, but have yet to hear back. Here, Apple dialed back its noise suppression in favor of voice clarity. While you’ll hear the slight roar of background noise in my audio clip, I actually sound better overall. It seems like Apple is now defaulting to 48kHz as part of the overall sound boost, but that’s currently unclear and is something else I’ve asked the company for more info about. For photos, you get a three-second countdown before your device snaps the picture. Most AirPods users have probably fallen asleep with one or both of the earbuds in their ears. Another item on the list of AirPods updates is automatic switching for CarPlay."

    "summary": "YouTube will be included in Australia's social media ban for children under 16, as reported by Bloomberg. The country's Labor government said that the site will be subject to the same rules as other leading platforms like Facebook, Instagram, TikTok and X when the legislation goes into effect this December.\nAustralia had planned to exempt YouTube from the forthcoming social media ban, on the grounds that it's an educational tool. This irked other platforms, with Meta and TikTok urging the country's government to backtrack on the exclusion.\nThis move didn't sit too well with YouTube and parent company Alphabet. A company spokesperson told CNN that this decision “reverses a clear, public commitment” from the government to treat the platform as an educational tool. YouTube Kids isn't included in the ban because it doesn't allow users to upload videos or comment.\nThe government said this reversal was largely influenced by a survey released by Australia's independent online regulator, the eSafety Commission. It found that 37 percent of children surveyed had reported seeing harmful content on YouTube. This includes stuff like dangerous online challenges, fight videos and hateful rhetoric.\n\nCommunications Minister Anika Wells recently spoke to the Australian Parliament and noted that \"YouTube uses the same persuasive design features as other social media platforms, like infinite scroll, like autoplay and algorithmic feed.\" She went on to say that she accepted the results of the aforementioned survey and that YouTube \"should not be treated differently from other social media platforms.\"\nThe ban originally passed at the tail-end of last year, though some of the details have yet to be ironed out. The government has until December to finalize everything. We do know that the ban puts the onus on the actual platforms to prevent children from opening up accounts, as they'll face hefty fines of up to nearly $50 million Australian dollars ($32 million USD) if they don't comply.\n“Kids, God bless them, are going to find a way around this. Maybe they’re all going to swarm on LinkedIn. We don’t know,” Minister Wells said.

    "summary": "Mark Zuckerberg has spent the last several months and several billion dollars recruiting prominent AI researchers and executives for a new \"superintelligence\" team at Meta. Now, the Meta CEO has published a lengthy memo that attempts to lay out his big plan for using the company's vast resources to create \"personal superintelligence.\"\nIn the memo, which reads more like a manifesto than a strategic business plan, Zuckerberg explains that he's \"extremely optimistic that superintelligence will help humanity accelerate our pace of progress.\" The technology, according to him, \"has the potential to begin a new era of personal empowerment where people will have greater agency to improve the world in the directions they choose.\"\nZuckerberg, who has previously expressed a desire to build artificial general intelligence, never defines \"superintelligence.\" Nor does the 616-word memo explain how Meta plans to create such a technology, what it might help people accomplish or why anyone should trust the company to build it. Instead, he implies that Meta will be a better steward of this non-specifically powerful AI than \"others in the industry\" who expect \"humanity will live on a dole of its output.\"\nAs profound as the abundance produced by AI may one day be, an even more meaningful impact on our lives will likely come from everyone having a personal superintelligence that helps you achieve your goals, create what you want to see in the world, experience any adventure, be a better friend to those you care about, and grow to become the person you aspire to be.\nMeta's vision is to bring personal superintelligence to everyone. We believe in putting this power in people's hands to direct it towards what they value in their own lives.\nThis is distinct from others in the industry who believe superintelligence should be directed centrally towards automating all valuable work, and then humanity will live on a dole of its output. At Meta, we believe that people pursuing their individual aspirations is how we have always made progress expanding prosperity, science, health, and culture. This will be increasingly important in the future as well. \nLeft unsaid by Zuckerberg, is the fact that the memo comes at a time when he's been rapidly reorganizing Meta's AI teams. Last month, the company invested $14.8 billion into Scale AI, a move that allowed it to bring Scale CEO and founder Alexandr Wang into the company. The 28-year-old founder is now Meta's Chief AI Officer in charge of its superintelligence efforts.\nMeta has also been on a hiring spree for the effort, and has reportedly been offering prominent researchers eight- and nine-figure pay packages to come to Meta. In recent weeks, the company has successfully recruited high-profile talent from Apple and OpenAI, including Shengjia Zhao, who helped created GPT-4. Zhao announced last week that he will take on the role of \"chief scientist of Meta superintelligence labs.\" Just yesterday, Wired reported that Meta has recently turned its recruiting efforts to Thinking Machines Lab, an AI startup founded by former OpenAI CTO Mira Murati, and that in at least one case it made an offer worth more than $1 billion over several years. (Meta PR said some details of that report were \"off.\") All that is on top of the $72 billion Zuckerberg has said Meta plans to spend on AI infrastructure.\nDriving all this is that Zuckerberg has reportedly grown increasingly frustrated by Meta's own generative AI efforts. The company has had to delay its larger \"Behemoth\" Llama 4 model by months. Llama's struggles have also reportedly caused Zuckerberg to question whether Meta's AI efforts should remain open source, according to CNBC.\nIt's also likely no coincidence Zuckerberg's rambling manifesto comes hours before the company is scheduled to report earnings and tell analysts more about its plans to spend billions of dollars on new AI efforts.\nMeta's CEO also clearly sees AI dominance as an opportunity to end the company's reliance on mobile platforms, especially Apple, which he believes have been able to exert too much control via their app stores. In his memo, he explains that \"personal devices like glasses … will become our primary computing devices.\" A future where smart glasses are more important than smartphones would, of course, be extremely convenient for Meta, which has spent the last several years building smart glasses.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/mark-zuckerberg-shares-a-confusing-vision-for-ai-superintelligence-153944322.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "In just a matter of weeks — if it sticks to its usual schedule — Apple will announce its newest collection of smartphones: the iPhone 17 lineup. And while we got a glimpse of what's to come on the software side of things during last June's WWDC event, we don't yet know what the new iPhones will look like, and what new features they'll offer. However, there have been several leaks and rumors about the hardware side ahead of the phones' official introduction. Here's what we're expecting and what we can reasonably assume we'll get from Cupertino in September.\nWhat are the latest iPhone 17 rumors and reports?\nNot all iPhone rumors are created equal, and all should be taken with a grain of salt. As August comes to a close, we've gotten a glimpse of a purported iPhone 17 \"spotted in the wild.\" \nI just spotted a test development iPhone in the wild 🤩🤩🤩 pic.twitter.com/iS3PtKWqxJ— Fox Pupy 🦊🧡 (@Skyfops) July 28, 2025\n\nThe pics, highlighted on MacRumors, show a black cased iPhone (17?) with the sort of extended top rear \"camera island\" rumored to be coming to the new Pro iPhones. Is it the real deal? The dual angles lend a degree of credibility in a social media landscape increasingly polluted with AI-enhanced fakes, but your guess is as good as ours.  \nBut that's not the only rumor. A \"tipster\" contacted MacRumors to allege three new iPhone Pro camera features: an upgraded telephoto lens with up to 8x optical zoom (up from the current 5x); an all-new pro camera app from Apple for photos and videos; and an additional Camera Control button on the top edge of the phone. That last one seems especially unbelievable, as it would be the third new button added to new iPhones in as many years. Do we really need two dedicated camera keys, in addition to the Action Button? \nWhen will the iPhone 17 series be announced?\nMost years, the flagship smartphones are introduced in September. It's a little early to have the specific dates; some years, Apple only gives a week or two of lead time between sending invites and hosting the event. But years of past precedent show that sometime in September should be when the 17 models make their debut. This family of smartphones may be the last to follow that trend, however. There have been hints that the introduction of the iPhone 18 collection in 2026 will be split into a pro-tier announcement in the fall and a standard model announcement the following spring.\nWhat will the new iPhone 17 lineup include?\nDesign leaks suggest that Apple is building an ultra-thin smartphone, likely to be named the iPhone 17 Air to match Apple's ultralight laptop designation. Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, often a solid source of advanced intel about Apple, reported in January that the iPhone 17 Air will be equipped with a basic A19 chip and will only have a single camera lens. It may also use Apple's new in-house modem, which was introduced in February on the iPhone 16e. More details about this development may leak ahead of September, but that's what we know for now.\nAn investor note from Apple analyst Jeff Pu indicated that the Air will have a titanium frame. If his reports are accurate, the lightweight smartphone will be the only entry in the iPhone 17 lineup to use that metal; the iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone 17 Pro Max are expected to be made of aluminum, which is oddly a lighter material than titanium. Other speculation had suggested that the Air would use a blend of aluminum and titanium, so the exact materials may not be known until the official announcement.\nEach new roster includes a base model, but over the years, Apple shakes up the variety of phones it offers. Most likely there will be an iPhone 17 and an iPhone 17 Pro. Apple has also committed to the size matters philosophy, and has been building an iPhone Pro Max option with an even bigger screen and better battery life; the 17 roster will almost certainly have one as well. \nThe iPhone 17 Air seems primed to take the place of a potential iPhone 17 Plus. Since the iPhone 16e was only just introduced in February at a surprisingly high price point, it seems unlikely that there will be a new addition to that lower end of the spectrum, the models that were previously called SE. \nAt the very least, it sounds like the iPhone 17 Air won't take away the charging port and rely only on wireless connectivity. Bloomberg said that while Apple had investigated making the iPhone 17 Air without a single port, the company (fortunately) changed plans. He also says that the rumored phone will have a 6.6-inch screen and include the Dynamic Island and Camera Control button. Finally, the price is rumored at $900 — likely more than the standard iPhone 17 but less than the Pro.\nWe've also gotten what seems to be a reliable look at what the color lineup will be for the new smartphones. Macworld reported that the iPhone 17 will be available in black, white, steel gray, green, purple and light blue. The iPhone 17 Air will reportedly have four color options: black, white, light blue and light gold. While the Air colors will be less saturated, the visuals for the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max will go bold. The options for the Pro models are expected to be black, white, gray, dark blue and orange.\nWhat will iOS 26 be like?\nApple upended its numbering conventions with WWDC 2025, and will match the name of each new operating system to the year it's released. So when the next wave of iPhones hits, they'll be running on iOS 26.\nOn the design side, the smartphone OS introduced during the big developer showcase took a contentious approach dubbed Liquid Glass. Apple has been scaling down the amount of transparency effects in the subsequent beta tests of iOS 26, but it will still have a glass-like visual.\nThe feature list includes big and small updates. On the more impactful side, the Phone and Photos apps have been redesigned. There will be several features leveraging artificial intelligence, such as live translation capabilities coming to Phone, FaceTime and Messages. Apple is also currently testing a sensitive content warning for child accounts that will freeze FaceTime video if nudity is detected by on-device machine learning tools. And the company is also launching Visual Intelligence, which will use AI to search for elements in an image.\niOS 26 also has a litany of minor, quality of life improvements. Group texts are getting support for polls. And for the slow risers out there, iOS 26 will finally let you escape the tyranny of the nine minute snooze alarm. \nThe next iOS is now available as a public beta. Here are our initial impressions of the Liquid Glass design and other new features. iOS 26 is compatible with all models back through iPhone 11.\nUpdate, July 30, 2025,11:08AM ET: Added latest leaks and rumors about the iPhone 17, and updated information on the iOS 26 public beta.\nUpdate, July 17, 2025, 4:40PM ET: Added latest information about iOS 26, possible materials for the Air, and the color options for the different models.\nUpdate, March 17, 2025, 2PM ET: Added details about the rumored price and features of the iPhone 17 Air.\nUpdate, April 11, 2025, 3:45PM ET: Added details from Front Page Tech's new video that claims to reveal details from a leaked iOS 19 build.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/iphone-17-pro-max-and-air-everything-we-know-about-apples-new-phones-153024282.html?src=rss",

Respawn says it built Wildcard as a faster-paced alternative to the core battle royale mode. For instance, when you take out an enemy, they won't leave behind a death box. Instead, their loot will scatter around them, making it easier for you to spot and pick up an item you need or want.\nAnother big difference here is legend stacking. You and your teammates will all be able to play as the same character, if you like. Respawn has retooled the Kings Canyon map for Wildcard, adding ziplines, gravity cannons and other fun stuff to the playground. Second chances will give you another opportunity to pick up the win if things don't pan out for you at first.\nIt's highly likely that Wildcard has been in the works for quite a while, but it's a bit unfortunate for Respawn that it's debuting the mode several weeks after Epic Games added a new, faster-paced battle royale option of its own to Fortnite. Rounds of Blitz Royale — which Epic designed primarily for mobile devices — can last just a few minutes each. Still, it's probably been a couple of years since I last played Apex, and Wildcard has me intrigued enough to dive back in.\nThere are plenty of other updates coming to Apex when the Showdown season starts, of course. Caustic will have a new ability called Field Research, while his gas canisters and grenades will deal more damage. Meanwhile, Bangalore's smoke canister will be able to breach doors and gain an EMP upgrade. In addition, Respawn is retooling the mid-to-late game with powerful passive abilities called Amps. These will allow you to unlock boosts like infinite ammo, extra armor and healing upgrades.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/a-new-faster-paced-game-mode-is-coming-to-apex-legends-on-august-5-150048274.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Google says it will sign the European Union’s new AI Code of Practice, which provides a framework for compliance with the EU’s AI Act. The act itself was passed in 2024, but its many provisions will take months to years to come into effect. The non-binding Code of Practice is a voluntary measure intended to help ensure that companies generally meet the obligations laid out by the Act in the meantime.\nIn a blog post announcing Google’s participation, the tech giant shared some skepticism about the AI Act’s impact on the technology in the EU. The statement reads in part, \"While the final version of the Code comes closer to supporting Europe’s innovation and economic goals than where it began — and we appreciate the opportunity we have been provided to submit comments — we remain concerned that the AI Act and Code risk slowing Europe’s development and deployment of AI.\"\nJust recently, Meta said it would not be signing the Code of Practice. The company’s chief global affairs officer, Joel Kaplan, called the Code an \"over-reach.\" In a statement, Kaplan said, \"Europe is heading down the wrong path on AI.\"\nThe EU’s AI Act is the first of its kind from a major regulator and is comprehensive in its approach. Meanwhile, the United States is in the earliest stages of determining its approach to AI regulation.\nObligations under the EU’s AI Act are being implemented in a staggered fashion, though rules governing general‑purpose AI (GPAI) models will apply on August 2, 2025.

    "summary": "Earlier this year, Lenovo released a more streamlined and potentially affordable take on its flagship gaming handheld in the Legion Go S. Unfortunately, the Windows 11 version came first, which wasn’t the one we were most excited about. Now, the Legion Go S powered by SteamOS has arrived, and oh my, what a difference an operating system can make. Not only does this model feature a UI that's much better suited for a portable gaming machine, it has faster performance as well. But the best part is that the SteamOS variant is less expensive than its Windows sibling. All of this makes for a handheld that's a welcome alternative to the Steam Deck, especially for anyone who's not a fan of Valve's hardware.\n \nDesign and display: Keeping it simple\nLike its sibling, the SteamOS version of the Legion Go S features a very straightforward design. A big difference between the two is that this model features a dark purple body instead of the white shell on the Windows variant. Thanks to its large 8-inch 1200p display and sizable grips, it's a bit chunkier than rivals like the Steam Deck or the ROG Ally X. At 500 nits, brightness is above average compared to typical handheld PCs. However, because Lenovo uses an LCD panel, colors aren't quite as vibrant and you don't get those pure inky blacks like you do on a system with an OLED screen such as the original Legion Go. \n\n\n\n\n   Sam Rutherford for Engadget \n \n\nI like that Lenovo included Hall effect sensors for its joysticks, along with a toggle that lets you adjust the pull depth of the triggers. Plus, the addition of a second USB-C port allows you to charge the device while keeping other accessories plugged in. There's also a pair of programmable paddles on the back and a handy microSD card slot for expandable storage.\nThe biggest departures from the flagship Legion Go are that this model's joysticks and buttons cannot be detached and its built-in touchpad is significantly smaller. This means the latter is better suited to moving the cursor around SteamOS in desktop mode or to navigating menus than it is as a true alternate control scheme while playing games. You also don't get a fingerprint reader, which I think should be a standard inclusion on handheld gaming PCs at this point.\nPerformance and software: Better with SteamOS\n\n\n\n\n   Sam Rutherford for Engadget \n \n\nThe Legion Go S powered by SteamOS is available in multiple configurations. Our $830 review unit features an AMD Ryzen Z1 Extreme chip with 32GB of RAM and 1TB of storage. Unfortunately, this means I wasn't able to run true apples-to-apples performance tests with the Ryzen Z2 Go-equipped version of the Windows Legion Go S I reviewed earlier this year. But given the lackluster results from that model, I generally wouldn't recommend any handheld powered by that chip, even though that version is significantly more affordable. If budget is a concern, Valve's Steam Deck remains the better option.\nEven though the Go S with SteamOS features the exact same chip, I actually saw slightly better performance here compared to the original Legion Go. With both systems set to a 15-watt TDP (total device power), the Legion Go S edged out the Windows model in Cyberpunk 2077 at 800p on medium graphics by pumping out 58 fps versus 54 fps. By comparison, the Steam Deck OLED managed 53 fps. And in Control at 800p on medium, it was a similar situation, though the gap was even smaller. The Legion Go S hit 29 fps, beating out the OG Legion Go (27 fps) and the Steam Deck OLED (24 fps).\n\n\n\n\n   Sam Rutherford for Engadget \n \n\nThe cause of the SteamOS model's improved horsepower is hard to pinpoint — especially as performance varies from title to title — but it's generally due to Valve's platform having less overhead and system processes than Windows-based rivals. And if that wasn't enough, the SteamOS UI is better designed for a dedicated gaming machine, as turning on the system boots you right into your game library as opposed to spitting you out into Microsoft's classic desktop view. There are also some minor tweaks in Valve's OS to support features like the built-in RGB lighting on the Legion Go S — something the Steam Deck doesn't have.\nFor fans of SteamOS, the main reason aside from price to pick a Steam Deck over the Legion Go S (or vice versa) is that each system features different performance targets. Valve's handheld has a TDP that tops out at 15 watts, and at lower power levels, it features better energy efficiency than the Legion Go S. This makes it more suitable for people who regularly play older games or less demanding 2D fare. Alternatively, Lenovo's handheld has a max TDP of 33 watts (or 40 when plugged into the wall), which makes it more adept at handling resource-intensive modern titles. So if you want higher frame rates (which you probably do), a Z1 Extreme Legion Go S with SteamOS has way more headroom to push pixels even harder. \nBattery life: Just a touch more efficient\n\n\n\n\n   Sam Rutherford for Engadget \n \n\nFeaturing a mid-size 55WHr battery, longevity on the Legion Go S when running SteamOS doesn't really stand out. However, I found that on average, it runs up to 30 minutes longer than its Windows counterpart across a number of titles. When playing Metal Slug Tactics, it lasted just shy of three hours (2:50) compared to closer to an hour and a half for the Windows 11 model (2:33). It was a similar situation in Elden Ring, where the SteamOS version was able to continue for an extra 15 minutes after its sibling conked out.\nWrap-up\nThe Legion Go S powered by SteamOS is a simple and well-built gaming handheld with an even bigger screen than Valve's portable and arguably better ergonomics. When configured with a Ryzen Z1 Extreme chip, it's a better choice for playing more demanding modern games without feeling forced to switch to a Windows-based device. It also has a more optimized UI than its Microsoft-powered rivals while retaining handy features like Hall effect joysticks and dual USB-C ports.\n\n\n\n\n   Sam Rutherford for Engadget \n \n\nWith Z1 Extreme models starting at $830 instead of $600 for the Z2 Go configs, though, it's not quite as affordable as I thought it would be back when it was first announced at the beginning of the year. But even so, it's nice to have options. And as just one of two handhelds on the market that come with SteamOS pre-installed, the Legion Go S makes an interesting argument as a bigger and more powerful upgrade to the Steam Deck.\n\n\n\n\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/legion-go-s-powered-by-steamos-review-a-purpose-built-os-makes-all-the-difference-120059561.html?src=rss",
    "full_text": "At 500 nits, brightness is above average compared to typical handheld PCs. However, because Lenovo uses an LCD panel, colors aren't quite as vibrant and you don't get those pure inky blacks like you do on a system with an OLED screen such as the original Legion Go. If budget is a concern, Valve's Steam Deck remains the better option. With both systems set to a 15-watt TDP (total device power), the Legion Go S edged out the Windows model in Cyberpunk 2077 at 800p on medium graphics by pumping out 58 fps versus 54 fps. And if that wasn't enough, the SteamOS UI is better designed for a dedicated gaming machine, as turning on the system boots you right into your game library as opposed to spitting you out into Microsoft's classic desktop view. For fans of SteamOS, the main reason aside from price to pick a Steam Deck over the Legion Go S (or vice versa) is that each system features different performance targets. Valve's handheld has a TDP that tops out at 15 watts, and at lower power levels, it features better energy efficiency than the Legion Go S. This makes it more suitable for people who regularly play older games or less demanding 2D fare. Featuring a mid-size 55WHr battery, longevity on the Legion Go S when running SteamOS doesn't really stand out. When playing Metal Slug Tactics, it lasted just shy of three hours (2:50) compared to closer to an hour and a half for the Windows 11 model (2:33). It also has a more optimized UI than its Microsoft-powered rivals while retaining handy features like Hall effect joysticks and dual USB-C ports."

    "summary": "TikTok users in the United States will soon see crowd-sourced fact checks appearing alongside videos on the platform. The app is beginning to roll out Footnotes, its version of Community Notes, the company announced.\nTikTok announced its plan to adopt the feature back in April and since then almost 80,000 users have been approved as contributors. Footnotes works similarly to Community Notes on X. Contributors can add a note to videos with false claims, AI-generated content or that otherwise require more context. Contributors are required to cite a source for the information they provide and other contributors need to rate a footnote as helpful before it will show up broadly.

Users will be able to read the full note and view a link to its source material.\nWhile TikTok is the latest major platform to adopt the crowd sourced approach to fact checking, unlike Meta, the company is still continuing to work with professional fact checking organizations, including in the United States. The company also points out that Footnotes will be subject to the same content moderation standards as the rest of its platform, and that people can report notes that might break its rules. The presence of a note won't, however, impact whether a particular video is eligible for recommendations in the \"For You\" feed.\nFor now, the company isn't making any commitments to roll out the system beyond the US. \"We picked the US market because it's sufficiently large that it has a content ecosystem that can support this kind of a test,\" TikTok's head of integrity and authenticity product, Erica Ruzic, said during a press event. \"We will be evaluating over the coming weeks and months, as we see how our US pilot is going, whether we would want to expand this to additional markets.\"\nThe test of Footnotes comes at a moment when the company's future in the United States is still somewhat in limbo. President Donald Trump has delayed a potential ban three times since taking office in January as a long long-promised \"deal\" to create a US-owned TikTok entity has yet to materialize. Trump said a month ago that an agreement could be announced in \"two weeks.\" Since then, there have also been reports that TikTok owner ByteDance is working on a new, US-only version of the app in anticipation of a deal. TikTok representatives declined to comment on those reports, which have suggested such an app could debut in early September.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/tiktoks-community-notes-era-starts-today-110041152.html?src=rss",

For budding creators, it’s a frustration; for those looking to make more professional content, it’s a dealbreaker. Fortunately, the world of mobile-specific (or phone-friendly) microphones has exploded with great options in the last few years. Whether you’ve been tasked with recording candid moments at a relative’s wedding, shooting a friend’s dance moves or are a journalist out in the field traveling light — there’s an option out there that will be perfect for you.We’ve tested a wide range of popular microphones with a mobile focus so that you don’t have to. Below is our hand-picked list of the very best options for a variety of use cases. Some microphones — the wireless lavalier kind, for example — will be more versatile and convenient, useful for a number of different applications. Others, such as our musician or field-recording picks, are where we explore more exotic form factors such as shotgun mics and mobile-friendly desktop options. As always, above everything else is sound quality and general performance. The good news for you is that we’ve done all the hard work for you. Happy recording!\nBest phone mics for 2025: Best wireless mics for creators\n“Creator” is a broad term, but for the purposes of this guide, it’s anyone that wants to make videos or recordings to share on the internet. This is possibly the most exciting category right now with excellent options from brands such as Rode and DJI, but also some compelling budget options too. Once the domain of TV and pro productions, wireless lavalier mics are now the go-to choice for anyone creating in front of (or even behind) the camera. They usually sound great, offer hands-free flexibility and premium models come with extra features that will streamline your creative process. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-mobile-microphones-for-recording-with-a-phone-154536629.html?src=rss",
    "full_text": "They usually sound great, offer hands-free flexibility and premium models come with extra features that will streamline your creative process. The standard kit includes two wireless microphones and a receiver that connects either via USB-C or Lightning. The claimed range is over 300 feet (100 meters), but in our testing it’s less reliable after about 200 feet (60 meters), but that’s still plenty for most use cases. Ignore the unfamiliar brand name; this mic provides great sound and reliability at a price that’s hard to argue with. James Trew for Engadget Best shotgun mic for most people Rode VideoMic NTG Of all Rode’s numerous shotgun mics, the VideoMic NTG is the one I keep going to when I need something that will get almost any job done. Older iPhones will need a USB-C to Lightning cable, but everyone else can plug right in and start recording. Shure’s companion app also puts handy features such as tone control, reverb and a high pass filter right at your fingertips. It’s a little higher-priced than other USB options, but as a dynamic mic it’s perfect for recording in less than ideal settings such as hotel rooms or cafes. The onboard microphone capsule is perfect for recording both vocals and instruments, and there’s a 3.5mm input so a fellow artist can plug into this to be recorded at the same time. There’s enough onboard storage for a generous 40 hours of 32-bit float recordings, making the Interview Pro completely functional without your phone."

    "summary": "Smartwatches do more than just track your steps and deliver phone alerts to your wrist. The best smartwatches go even further, giving you the ability to pay for a cup of coffee, take calls and connect to apps like Spotify all without whipping out your smartphone.Chances are, if you’re reading this, you already know all of the benefits of a smartwatch. You’re ready to invest, or upgrade from an aging accessory, but we wouldn’t blame you if you if you didn’t know where to start. There are dozens of smartwatches available now, including GPS running watches, fitness trackers that look like smartwatches and multi-purpose devices. Plus, you’ll want to consider factors like durability, battery life and operating system before you spend a lot of money on a new wearable. We’ve tested and reviewed most major smartwatches available today and these are our top picks.\nTable of contents\n\nBest smartwatches for 2025\nStylish smartwatches: Fossil and more\nFactors to consider before buying a smartwatch\nOther smartwatches our experts tested\nSmartwatch FAQs\n\nBest smartwatches of 2025\n \n \n \n \n \nStylish smartwatches: Fossil and more\n\n\n\n\n   Fossil \n \n\nYes, there are still companies out there trying to make “fashionable” hybrid smartwatches. Back when wearables were novel and generally ugly, brands like Fossil, Michael Kors and Skagen found their niche in stylish smartwatches that took cues from analog timepieces. You also have the option to pick up a “hybrid” smartwatch from companies like Withings and Garmin – these devices look like classic wrist watches but incorporate some limited functionality like activity tracking and heart rate monitoring. They remain good options if you prefer that look, but thankfully, wearables made by Apple, Samsung, Fitbit and others have gotten much more attractive over the past few years. \nUltimately, the only thing you can’t change after you buy a smartwatch is its case design. If you’re not into the Apple Watch’s squared-off corners, all of Samsung’s smartwatches have round cases that look a little more like a traditional watch. Most wearables are offered in a choice of colors and you can pay extra for premium materials like stainless steel for extra durability. Once you decide on a case, your band options are endless – there are dozens of first- and third-party watch straps available for most major smartwatches, and for both larger and smaller wrists, allowing you to change up your look whenever you please.\nFactors to consider before buying a smartwatch\nCompatibility\nApple Watches only work with iPhones, while Wear OS devices play nice with both iOS and Android phones. Smartwatches made by Samsung, Garmin, Fitbit and others are also compatible with Android and iOS, but you’ll need to install a companion app on your smartphone.\nThe smartwatch OS will also dictate the type and number of third-party apps you’ll have access to. Many of these aren’t useful, though, making this factor a fairly minor one in the grand scheme of things.\nPrice\nThe best smartwatches generally cost between $300 and $400. Compared to budget smartwatches, which cost between $100 and $250, these pricier devices have advanced operating systems, communications, music and fitness features. They also often include perks like onboard GPS tracking, music storage and NFC, AMOLED displays, and long battery life, things that budget devices generally don’t have.\nSome companies make specialized fitness watches: Those can easily run north of $500, and we’d only recommend them to serious athletes. Luxury smartwatches from brands like TAG Heuer and Hublot can also reach sky-high prices, but we wouldn’t endorse any of them. These devices can cost more than $1,000, and you’re usually paying for little more than a brand name and some needlessly exotic selection of build materials.\nBattery life\nBattery life remains one of our biggest complaints about smartwatches, but there’s hope as of late. You can expect two full days from Apple Watches and most Wear OS devices. Watches using the Snapdragon Wear 3100 processor support extended battery modes that promise up to five days of battery life on a charge — if you’re willing to shut off most features aside from, you know, displaying the time. Other models can last five to seven days, but they usually have fewer features and lower-quality displays. Meanwhile, some fitness watches can last weeks on a single charge. If long battery life is a priority for you, it’s worth checking out the watch’s specs beforehand to see what the manufacturer estimates.\nCommunication\nAny smartwatch worth considering delivers call, text and app notifications to your wrist. Call and text alerts are self explanatory, but if those mean a lot to you, consider a watch with LTE. They’re more expensive than their WiFi-only counterparts, but cellular connectivity allows the smartwatch to take and receive phone calls, and do the same with text messages, without your device nearby. As far as app alerts go, getting them delivered to your wrist will let you glance down to the watch face and see if you absolutely need to check your phone right now.\nFitness tracking\nActivity tracking is a big reason why people turn to smartwatches. An all-purpose timepiece should function as a fitness tracker, logging your steps, calories and workouts, and most of today’s wearables have a heart rate monitor as well.\nMany smartwatches' fitness features include a built-in GPS, which is useful for tracking distance for runs and bike rides. Swimmers will want something water resistant, and thankfully most all-purpose devices now can withstand at least a dunk in the pool. Some smartwatches from companies like Garmin are more fitness focused than others and tend to offer more advanced features like heart-rate-variance tracking, recovery time estimation, onboard maps and more.\nHealth tracking on smartwatches has also seen advances over the years. Both Apple and Fitbit devices can estimate blood oxygen levels and measure ECGs. But the more affordable the smartwatch, the less likely it is that it has these kinds of advanced health tracking features; if collecting those kinds of wellness metrics is important to you, you’ll have to pay for the privilege.\nMusic\nYour watch can not only track your morning runs but also play music while you’re exercising. Many smartwatches let you save your music locally, so you can connect wireless earbuds via Bluetooth and listen to tunes without bringing your phone. Those that don’t have onboard storage for music usually have on-watch music controls, so you can control playback without whipping out your phone. And if your watch has LTE, local saving isn’t required — you’ll be able to stream music directly from the watch to your paired earbuds.\nDisplays\nMost wearables have touchscreens and we recommend getting one that has a full-color touchscreen. Some flagships like the Apple Watch have LTPO displays, which stands for low-temperature polycrystalline oxide. These panels have faster response times and are more power efficient, resulting in a smoother experience when one interacts with the touchscreen and, in some cases, longer battery lives.\nYou won’t see significant gains with the latter, though, because the extra battery essentially gets used up when these devices have always-on displays, as most flagship wearables do today. Some smartwatches have this feature on by default while others let you enable it via tweaked settings. This smart feature allows you to glance down at your watch to check the time, health stats or any other information you’ve set it to show on its watchface without lifting your wrist. This will no doubt affect your device’s battery life, but thankfully most always-on modes dim the display’s brightness so it’s not running at its peak unnecessarily. Cheaper devices won’t have this feature; instead, their touchscreens will automatically turn off to conserve battery life and you’ll have to intentionally check your watch to turn on the display again.\nNFC\nMany new smartwatches have NFC, letting you pay for things without your wallet using contactless payments. After saving your credit or debit card information, you can hold your smartwatch up to an NFC reader to pay for a cup of coffee on your way home from a run. Keep in mind that different watches use different payment systems: Apple Watches use Apple Pay, Wear OS devices use Google Pay, Samsung devices use Samsung Pay and so forth.\nApple Pay is one of the most popular NFC payment systems, with support for multiple banks and credit cards in 72 different countries, while Samsung and Google Pay work in fewer regions. It’s also important to note that both NFC payment support varies by device as well for both Samsung and Google’s systems.\nOther smartwatches our experts tested\nApple Watch Ultra 2\nThe Apple Watch Ultra 2 is probably overkill for most people, but it has a ton of extra features like extra waterproofing to track diving, an even more accurate GPS and the biggest battery of any Apple Watch to date. Apple designed it for the most rugged among us, but for your average person, it likely has more features than they'd ever need. If you’re particularly clumsy, however, its high level of durability could be a great reason to consider the Apple Watch Ultra 2.\nApple Watch SE\nThe Apple Watch SE is less feature-rich than the flagship model, but it will probably suffice for most people. We actually regard the Watch SE as the best smartwatch option for first-time buyers, or people on stricter budgets. You’ll get all the core Apple Watch features as well as things like fall and crash detection, noise monitoring and Emergency SOS, but you’ll have to do without more advanced hardware perks like an always-on display, a blood oxygen sensor, an ECG monitor and a skin temperature sensor.\nGarmin Forerunner 745\nGarmin watches in general can be great options for the most active among us. The Garmin Forerunner 745 is an excellent GPS running watch for serious athletes or those who prize battery life above all else. When we tested it, we found it to provide accurate distance tracking, a killer 16-hour battery life with GPS turned on (up to seven days without it) and support for onboard music storage and Garmin Pay.\nAmazfit Bip 6\nThe Amazfit Bip 6, an $80 smartwatch from Zepp Health, didn’t quite make the cut. As a fitness tracker, it’s decent, but it’s a frustrating smartwatch. For workouts, the built-in GPS tracks runs and rides without your phone and, combined with the heart rate and blood oxygen sensors, collects a good amount of data to create accurate pictures of your exertion levels, cadence and pace. It’s remarkably lightweight but doesn’t feel cheap and the AMOLED screen is bright and sharp. It’s not an always-on display, but lifting your wrist wakes it reliably.\nThe sleep tracking data is on par with what we measured on other smartwatches and there’s even a daily readiness score that compares your sleep quality and the previous day’s exertion to estimate how physically prepared you are for the day ahead — similar to what Pixel Watches, Fitbit devices and Garmin watches offer. And since the watch battery lasts for over a week on a charge, you may be a lot more apt to wear it to bed than a watch you have to charge daily.\nWe weren’t expecting an $80 device to be a serious Apple Watch challenger, but the Bip 6’s glitches and overly complicated interface (both on the app and on the watch itself) were disappointing. During a week of testing, I got multiple repeated notifications, even after they were deleted, along with suggestions to stand when I was actively doing chores around the house. The watch faces are not customizable, so it was hard to get the info I needed at a glance (the Zepp app has lots of paid watch faces that may have what I wanted, but I didn’t want to pay $3 for something that’s free elsewhere).\nMarketing details state that the Bip 6 can auto-detect workouts, including walking and bike riding. During testing, I walked once or twice per day for over one mile and went on two bike rides, but no workout was ever detected. The watch integrates with Apple Health, so I was able to see how it compares to the data my Apple Watch gathers. After a week of wearing the Bip 6, with no changes to my daily routine, I averaged 400 fewer calories burned and 2.4 fewer miles tracked each day. That was possibly the biggest disappointment of all. — Amy Skorheim, Senior Reporter\nSmartwatch FAQs\nIs there a difference between a smartwatch and a fitness tracker?\nWhile smartwatches and fitness trackers share some similarities, they’re designed for slightly different purposes.\nA fitness tracker is primarily focused on health and activity tracking. It keeps tabs on your steps, heart rate, sleep and workouts, and some even offer advanced metrics like blood oxygen levels and stress tracking. Fitness trackers are generally more compact, have longer battery life and are built with activity in mind.\nA smartwatch, on the other hand, is like a mini smartphone on your wrist. It offers fitness tracking features, but also lets you do things like reply to texts, take calls, use apps and control smart home devices. Many smartwatches support voice assistants, mobile payments and even LTE connectivity, so you can leave your phone behind in some cases.\nIf you mainly want health and activity tracking with long battery life, a fitness tracker is the way to go. If you want a more connected experience with extra features, a smartwatch is the better choice.\nHow long do smartwatches last?\nHow long a smartwatch lasts mostly depends on two things: battery life and overall durability.\nSmartwatch battery life varies a lot depending on the brand, features and how you use it. Basic models with e-ink displays or monochrome screens can last a week or more, while full-featured smartwatches like the Apple Watch or Samsung Galaxy Watch usually need a charge every day or two. If you're using features like always-on display, GPS tracking or LTE connectivity, expect the battery to drain faster.\nPhysically, a good smartwatch should last several years before you need to upgrade. Premium models with scratch-resistant glass, water resistance and strong build materials tend to hold up well over time. However, software support matters too — brands like Apple and Samsung typically provide updates for at least a few years, while some budget smartwatches may not get long-term software support.\nYou can expect to charge most smartwatches daily or every few days, and if you take care of them, they should last 3-5 years before an upgrade is necessary.\nHow much should you spend on a smartwatch?\nHow much you should spend on a smartwatch depends on what features you need and how often you plan to use it.\nIf you just want the basics — step tracking, notifications, heart rate monitoring and basic fitness tracking — you can find some solid budget-friendly options from brands like Amazfit, Fitbit and some Wear OS models. These usually have decent battery life but may lack premium features like LTE, advanced health tracking or third-party apps.\nIn the mid-range smartwatch price bracket, you’ll find popular models like the Apple Watch SE and Fitbit Versa series. These offer a good mix of fitness tracking, smart features and design quality. You’ll get better build materials, more accurate sensors and app support, but battery life might still be limited to a day or two.\nHigh-end smartwatches like the Apple Watch Ultra, Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra and Garmin Fenix/Epix series offer advanced health tracking, rugged designs, LTE connectivity and longer software support. These are great for serious athletes, outdoor adventurers, or anyone who wants the latest and greatest features.\nIf you just want a simple smartwatch for notifications and fitness tracking, a budget or mid-range model will do the job. But if you want a premium feel, advanced health tracking or LTE connectivity, it’s worth spending a bit more. For most people, $200 - $350 hits the best balance of features and value.\nDo all smartwatches have GPS?\nNot all smartwatches have built-in GPS. Some rely on your phone’s GPS, while others have it built-in for independent tracking.\nHigh-end and fitness-focused smartwatches, like the Apple Watch, Samsung Galaxy Watch and Garmin models have their own built-in GPS. This means they can track your runs, walks, bike rides and hikes without needing to be connected to your phone. It’s a must-have for serious athletes or anyone who wants accurate location tracking without carrying a phone.\nSome budget and mid-range smartwatches (like some Fitbit and Amazfit models) don’t have built-in GPS but can use your phone’s GPS when connected via Bluetooth. This works fine if you usually carry your phone while working out, but it’s less convenient if you prefer to leave it behind.\nSome very basic or budget smartwatches skip GPS entirely and rely solely on step tracking or motion sensors. These are fine for casual users who don’t need location tracking.\nCan you leave your phone at home and still use a smartwatch?\nYes, but it depends on the smartwatch and what you want to do without your phone.\nIf your smartwatch has LTE or cellular connectivity , you can make calls, send texts, stream music, use maps and even access apps without your phone nearby. However, you’ll need a separate data plan from your carrier, which usually comes with an extra monthly cost.\nEven without LTE, some smartwatches can still do plenty on their own, including track workouts and GPS routes (if they have built-in GPS), play music offline (if they support downloads from Spotify or Apple Music), may contactless payments with features like Apple Pay and Google Wallet and control smart home devices.\nIf going phone-free is important to you, look for a smartwatch with LTE and built-in GPS for the best experience.\nCan a smartwatch make calls without a phone?\nYes, a smartwatch can make calls without a phone — but only if it has the right features.\nSome smartwatches have built-in LTE connectivity, meaning they can work independently from your phone. You can make and receive calls, send texts, stream music and use apps as long as you have a mobile data plan for the watch. However, you’ll need to pay for a separate cellular plan and battery life drains faster when using LTE.\nIf your smartwatch doesn’t have LTE, it can still make calls, but only when connected to your phone via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi. It essentially acts as a remote speaker and microphone for your phone’s calls. Watches like the standard Apple Watch or Samsung Galaxy Watch (Wi-Fi versions) can do this. However, if your phone isn’t nearby or connected to Wi-Fi, calling won’t work.\nSome fitness-focused smartwatches (like certain Garmin, Fitbit and Amazfit models) don’t have a built-in speaker or microphone, so they can’t make or receive calls at all — only show notifications.\nIf calling without a phone is a must, make sure to choose an LTE model with a built-in mic and speaker.\nWhat's the difference between an Android and Apple smartwatch?\nThe biggest difference between Android and Apple smartwatches comes down to compatibility, features and ecosystem integration.\nApple smartwatches (Apple Watch) only work with iPhones. If you have an Android phone, you can’t use an Apple Watch at all. Android smartwatches (Wear OS, Samsung Galaxy, Garmin etc.) mostly work with Android phones, but some also support iPhones with limited features. If you have an iPhone, the Apple Watch is the best choice. If you have an Android phone, go for a Wear OS or Samsung Galaxy Watch.\nApple Watch (watchOS) has the best app support with seamless integration into Apple’s ecosystem (iMessage, FaceTime, Apple Pay, Apple Fitness+, Siri etc.). Android smartwatches offer more variety, with access to Google services (Google Assistant, Google Wallet and Google Maps), and some support Amazon Alexa or Samsung’s Bixby.\nIn terms of design, Apple Watch has a single design but comes in different sizes and materials. It’s sleek, but your only real customization comes from bands and watch faces. Android smartwatches, on the other hand, come in tons of styles and brands (Samsung, Google Pixel Watch, Garmin, Fossil etc.), meaning you can pick a round watch, a rugged design or a luxury-looking model.\nIf battery life is important to you, the Apple Watch lasts about a day or two per charge, depending on usage and model. Many Android smartwatches (especially Garmin, Amazfit or Mobvoi TicWatch) last multiple days or even weeks on a single charge.\nGeorgie Peru contributed to this report.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wearables/best-smartwatches-153013118.html?src=rss",
    "full_text": "The company claims you’ll get up to 19 hours of battery life with continuous GPS use, which should be enough for most runners and athletes competing in long-haul races. We think this will probably benefit beginner runners the most — those accustomed to coaching may not find it as useful. Some companies make specialized fitness watches: Those can easily run north of $500, and we’d only recommend them to serious athletes. Luxury smartwatches from brands like TAG Heuer and Hublot can also reach sky-high prices, but we wouldn’t endorse any of them. Swimmers will want something water resistant, and thankfully most all-purpose devices now can withstand at least a dunk in the pool. The Garmin Forerunner 745 is an excellent GPS running watch for serious athletes or those who prize battery life above all else. If you mainly want health and activity tracking with long battery life, a fitness tracker is the way to go. Premium models with scratch-resistant glass, water resistance and strong build materials tend to hold up well over time. These usually have decent battery life but may lack premium features like LTE, advanced health tracking or third-party apps. However, you’ll need to pay for a separate cellular plan and battery life drains faster when using LTE."
