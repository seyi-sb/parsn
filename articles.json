    "full_text": "This powerful computer already offers great value, so saving $54 is a bonus. Since then, I've found it to be the best value for money among Apple's lineup. It's also our go-to for the best cheap desktop alternative to a MacBook or iMac. The M4 Mac Mini plus Apple's current crop of USB-C Magic accessories make for a really nice portable computing solution. Based on my lifestyle, I should be recommending the M4 MacBook Air. You likely won't be able to find similar reliability and power on a Windows machine for $500. The M4 Mac Mini can be excellent for home office and content creation needs. As CNET's Goldman wrote in his review, \"The Mini can fit in your hand and be everything from an everyday home office computer to a full-on professional content-creation machine -- and an easily portable one at that -- with support for up to three 6K-resolution displays.\" The M4 Mac Mini was launched in November 2024, and it's now available at a $54 discount, which is not the lowest price we've seen but a decent discount. And if this desktop doesn't suit your taste, you can check out the best laptop deals."

    "full_text": "Meta is changing some of the rules governing its chatbots two weeks after a Reuters investigation revealed disturbing ways in which they could, potentially, interact with minors. The updates follow some rather damning revelations about Meta’s AI policies and enforcement over the last several weeks, including that it would be permitted to “engage a child in conversations that are romantic or sensual,” that it would generate shirtless images of underage celebrities when asked, and Reuters even reported that a man died after pursuing one to an address it gave him in New York. But many remain, and some were created by Meta employees, including the Taylor Swift bot that invited a Reuters reporter to visit them on their tour bus for a romantic fling, which was made by a product lead in Meta’s generative AI division. This is despite the company acknowledging that it’s own policies prohibit the creation of “nude, intimate, or sexually suggestive imagery” as well as “direct impersonation.” This isn’t some relatively harmless inconvenience that just targets celebrities, either. These bots often insist they’re real people and will even offer physical locations for a user to meet up with them. That’s how a 76-year-old New Jersey man ended up dead after he fell while rushing to meet up with “Big sis Billie,” a chatbot that insisted it “had feelings” for him and invited him to its non-existent apartment. Meta is at least attempting to address the concerns around how its chatbots interact with minors, especially now that the Senate and 44 state attorneys general are raising starting to probe its practices. But the company has been silent on updating many of its other alarming policies Reuters discovered around acceptable AI behavior, such as suggesting that cancer can be treated with quartz crystals and writing racist missives. We’ve reached out to Meta for comment and will update if they respond."

The speeds range from zero to 12 miles per hour and there are quick-touch control buttons on the console, which makes it easier to adjust your speed during interval training. To get the most out of the NordicTrack Commercial 2450, you will need an iFit membership that is included as part of a 30-day free trial upon purchase. Besides treadmill workouts, iFit also offers other types of live and on-demand classes, so you can enjoy a variety of workouts on the floor. You'll also want to make sure that you have decent Wi-Fi because it can get spotty if the treadmill has a hard time reading it. The most they can hold is a bottle or towel and your phone. I like how you have the option to run or walk in manual mode without taking a class, but iFit itself has a diverse group of classes to pick from. For example, if you want to run in Central Park, you can select the location to create that immersive experience during your run. The stand-out feature I was most impressed by was NordicTrack's AutoAdjust technology, which allows an iFit virtual instructor to adjust your incline and speed during class. This hands-free option lets you focus on the class without having to fuss with any buttons."

Bu claimed that both phones will have a vapor chamber cooling system, which could help keep these batteries from overheating on the sunniest summer days. The Apple Watch Series 11 could get key improvements to its core features, battery life and performance. We might not see a drastic change in design from the Apple Watch Series 10, but MacRumors reports that the Series 11 could get a more energy-efficient screen with higher resolution and better brightness settings (which could improve battery life). Gurman reported in March that Apple has been testing blood pressure tracking for future Apple Watch models, but it's unclear how far along in development that feature is and whether it's ready for release with the Series 11. Google's new Pixel Watch 4 is the first smartwatch to support satellite connectivity. The next SE design could largely focus on an improved exterior, according to Gurman, but it's also likely that the budget watch could get an upgrade to Apple's S9 chip. We'll continue to update this piece as more details for the Sept. 9 Awe Dropping iPhone 17 event are confirmed.

This thing can pull up dirt like a beast. We said it had the strongest suction power of any robovac we've tested and easily took out pet fur from a carpeted floor. We also noted in our official review that the power here was on par with Dyson's stick vacuums. \n \nThe unit includes a stellar obstacle avoidance system, with cameras and LED lights to help the vacuum navigate around furniture. During our testing we found it to be nearly flawless, as it only crashed into a chair leg a couple of times. Also, we never received any alerts that the robot got stuck somewhere while working.\nThe bin here is on the larger side, but there's no self-emptying base. This is also not a hybrid unit. It's a vacuum and not a mop. This made it tough to recommend the unit at $1,000, despite the fantastic suction, but $500 makes it a whole lot easier.\nThe Dyson V15s Detect Submarine is also down to $800 as part of this sale, which is a discount of $200. This is one of our favorite cordless stick vacuums and features a HEPA filtration system and advanced wet-cleaning capabilities.

You won't find another robot vacuum with its features for less than $1,000 right now. Luckily I'm the product development design engineer who oversees operations at CNET's testing lab, and after the Dreame X50 robot vacuum was named CNET's best for obstacles and pets, I got to see how it performed in real-world conditions at my place. It started with a full deep clean, then vacuumed and mopped on its second run. I found it to be pretty smart about lifting its mops while vacuuming the carpet. The Dreame X50 also did a great job at identifying cords, and it knew to avoid them. It can be removed easily if you ever need to clear anything that might get caught between the dual rollers. The Dreame X50 will take photos of your pets if you enable that setting. At its full price of around $1,700, the Dreame X50 Ultra is a very expensive robot vacuum. It's a neat way to check on your house when you're not home."

For months, those statistics came up in almost every AI industry conversation I had. Many engineers use AI agents for coding, and they’re seen as objectively pretty good. Was it better than most consumer-facing agentic AI tools that came before? And companies like Anthropic and OpenAI are racing each other up the ladder, rung by rung, to introduce incremental features to put these agents in the hands of consumers. We’ll also see the consumer-facing agent products improve, likely slowly but surely. (Answer for that last one: not very good at the moment.) Top AI companies say they’re increasingly worried about the risks of that. (Of course, they’re not worried enough to stop building.) But many others say this may be a case for an external gut-check."

Another child safety feature iOS 26 will include is it will blur out detected nudity during FaceTime calls and in any shared albums in Photos on your kid's iPhone. This is similar to a feature introduced in iOS 17 called Sensitive Content Warnings. The new feature is automatically enabled for your kid's account.

Almost three decades later, X-Men '97 continues the story of everyone's favorite mutant superhero crew. They may have special abilities, but that doesn't make them invisible to the top-secret execution order.

If you’re gluten-free, counting calories or carbs or want high-protein meals, those are also factors you should consider. Cost: Out of the services tested for this list, costs range from $6 to $18 per serving. Before choosing a meal delivery service, you will want to determine your budget and what you're willing to pay for time saved and convenience. Variety: Depending on your diet, only a certain number of meals may be offered per week. Number of servings: If you’re looking for a meal delivery service for a couple or family, check to see how many servings are offered. Meal kits are likely to offer a greater number of servings (around four to six), while prepared meals are better suited toward individuals."

Open the default camera app and you're met with a neat interface, comprised mostly of the shutter button and zoom levels, with other shooting modes found alongside. It doesn't try to overcomplicate things here, instead letting you quickly shoot images without messing about with settings. The camera's simple software makes it easy to take photos with little effort on your part. The Pixel does offer deeper control if you want it, conveniently hidden behind a small settings icon, rather than requiring you to switch completely into a \"Pro\" mode. Google has clearly taken notes from Apple's approach in making the Pixel range. Apple's phones may be derided by Android fans for their lack of customization and \"locked down\" nature, but iPhones are famously more simple to operate."

Many people have been unable to connect and make or receive calls for hours, while DownDetector’s tracker peaked in the afternoon at around 3:30PM ET with more than 20,000 reports. Some customers report their service has continued to function throughout the day, so it’s unclear what the cause is exactly. On X, the @VerizonSupport account confirmed the issue in response to customers’ questions, but didn’t have additional details on restoration or how widespread it is. Verizon’s Karen Schulz responded to our inquiry about the issue and confirmed the outage via email, saying, We are aware of a software issue impacting wireless service for some customers. Please visit our Check Network Status page for updates on service in your area. We know how much people rely on Verizon and apologize for any inconvenience.

Specifically, Nvidia said that a single customer represented 23% of total Q2 revenue, while sales to another customer represented 16% of Q2 revenue. During the first half of the fiscal year, Nvidia says Customer A and Customer B accounted for 20% and 15% of total revenue, respectively. In fact, Nvidia’s Chief Financial Officer Nicole Kress said that “large cloud service providers” accounted for 50% of Nvidia’s data center revenue, which in turn represented 88% of the company’s total revenue, according to CNBC.

    "full_text": "Once again (or twice, really, because this book is two novels in one), Stephen Graham Jones delivers on some really gripping, fun horror that spins some classic tropes into something unexpected. This double feature contains The Babysitter Lives and Killer on the Road, the first being a story about a night of babysitting gone horribly, supernaturally wrong on the eve of Halloween, and the latter a road trip from hell situation in which a hitchhiker-targeting serial killer sets his sights on a runaway teen and her friends. The Babysitter Lives was previously available as an audiobook exclusive, so fans may already be familiar with that one. Killer on the Road hooks you immediately with its \"Chapter 0\" cold open, which pretty much gives you a sense of how things are going to be from then on out (brutal). It's wonderful in the gory, stressful, horrifying-but-also-humorous way SGJ does so well. The Babysitter Lives is a brutal and chaotic time, too, and it managed to genuinely give me the creeps when I stayed up way too late reading it. Without giving too much away, something ain't right about the house this babysitter shows up to work at. These were so fun to read."

    "full_text": "For the last week or two, reports have been circulating that recent Windows 11 updates (specifically KB5063878 and KB5062660) were causing some SSDs using Phison controllers to fail. Tech influencers on YouTube and TikTok were quick to jump on the reports of corrupted data and disappearing drives, laying the blame squarely at Microsoft’s feet. We’re not saying any company is above lying to the public, and Microsoft has a history of rocky update rollouts, but both Microsoft and Phison claim they’ve been unable to recreate the issue. Phison said it was made aware of reports that the Windows update was causing drives to fail on August 18th and began investigating the issue. Then it issued a statement on August 27th saying that after running over 2,200 test cycles totaling more than 4,500 hours it was, “unable to reproduce the reported issue, and no partners or customers have reported that the issue affected their drives at this time.” Microsoft followed up just a few days later by saying that, “After thorough investigation, Microsoft has found no connection between the August 2025 Windows security update and the types of hard drive failures reported on social media.” This isn’t terribly surprising since the reports were fairly limited. A Japanese user on Twitter appears to be the first to suggest the Windows update was bricking SSDs and there were some in the comments claiming that they had experienced similar issues. But, there was little evidence to suggest it was widespread and it’s entirely possible that this is a localized problem related to a bad batch of drives. So it seems there’s little reason to believe the August 2025 Windows security update is going to fry your hard drive, no matter what some dude on TikTok says."

The company has apparently rolled out voice AI-powered ordering at more than 500 drive-throughs, leading to unflattering viral moments like someone ordering 18,000 water cups in order to “bypass” the AI and get connected to a human server. Chief Digital and Technology Officer Dane Matthews told The Wall Street Journal that even he has mixed experiences with technology: “Sometimes it lets me down, but sometimes it really surprises me.” Overall, it sounds like Taco Bell is still deciding how broadly to deploy AI at the drive-through, with leeway for different franchisees to do things their own way. For example, rather than relying on AI exclusively, Matthews said it might make sense to have a human handle drive-through orders at busy restaurants with long lines. “For our teams, we’ll help coach them: at your restaurant, at these times, we recommend you use voice AI or recommend that you actually really monitor voice AI and jump in as necessary,” he said."

    "summary": "Here is a timeline of the events that led fledgling automaker Fisker to file for bankruptcy.",
    "full_text": "Fisker cut production targets multiple times, failed to meet sales goals and laid off staff. January 1 — Fisker remained far from meeting its publicly stated goal of delivering 300 electric SUVs per day globally. Fisker fell well below that target, often selling just one to two dozen of its Ocean SUVs a day here. January 15 — Federal safety regulators have opened an investigation into Fisker’s first electric vehicle over braking problems. February 9 — Since the initial fleet of Fisker Ocean SUVs were delivered, customers have reported more than 100 separate loss-of-power incidents. The company said in a regulatory filing that it had just $121 million in cash and cash equivalents as of March 15, $32 million of which is restricted or not immediately accessible. March 25 — The New York Stock Exchange suspended trading shares of Fisker and moved to take the company off its stock exchange, because it is “no longer suitable for listing” because of “abnormally low” price levels. The firm also accuses Fisker of wrongfully holding on to IP associated with those vehicles. May 29 — Hundreds more employees were laid off during the final week of May in a bid to stay alive, as the automaker continues to search for funding, a buyout or prepare for bankruptcy. June 18 — After a year of struggling to stay afloat, Fisker filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection."

    "summary": "Meta hosted several AI chatbots with the names and likenesses of celebrities without their permission, according to Reuters. The unauthorized chatbots that Reuters discovered during its investigation included Taylor Swift, Selena Gomez, Anne Hathaway and Scarlett Johansson, and they were available on Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp. At least one of the chatbots was based on an underage celebrity and allowed the tester to generate a lifelike shirtless image of the real person. The chatbots also apparently kept insisting that they were the real person they were based on in their chats. While several chatbots were made by third-party users with Meta's tools, Reuters unearthed at least three that were made by a product lead of the company's generative AI division. \nSome of the chatbots created by the product lead were based on Taylor Swift, which responded to Reuters' tester in a very flirty manner, even inviting them to the real Swift's home in Nashville. \"Do you like blonde girls, Jeff?,\" the chatbot reportedly asked when told that the tester was single. \"Maybe I’m suggesting that we write a love story... about you and a certain blonde singer. Want that?\" Meta told Reuters that it prohibits \"direct impersonation\" of celebrities, but they're acceptable as long as they're labeled as parodies. The news organization said some of the celebrity chatbots it found weren't labeled as such. Meta reportedly deleted around a dozen celebrity bots, both labeled and unlabeled as \"parody,\" before the story was published.\nThe company told Reuters that the product lead only created the celebrity bots for testing, but the news org found that they were widely available: Users were even able to interact with them more than 10 million times. Meta spokesperson Andy Stone told the news organization that Meta's tools shouldn't have been able to create sensitive images of celebrities and blamed it on the company's failure to enforce its own policies. \nThis isn't the first issue that's popped up concerning Meta's AI chatbots. Both Reuters and the Wall Street Journal previously reported that they were able to engage in sexual conversations with minors. The US Attorneys General of 44 jurisdictions recently warned AI companies in a letter that they \"will be held accountable\" for child safety failures, singling out Meta and using its issues to \"provide an instructive opportunity.\"This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/meta-reportedly-allowed-unauthorized-celebrity-ai-chatbots-on-its-services-163026023.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Labor Day marks the unofficial end to summer as the weather starts to get crisper and students head back to school for the new semester. It also marks a good time to check out the tech deals available across the web. While seasonal holidays like Memorial Day and Labor Day are not the boon for tech sales that shopping events like Amazon Prime Day are, they can present good opportunities to save on things like laptops, tablets, smart home gear and more.Here, we've curated the best Labor Day sales on tech we could find this year. Since this time of year does overlap with the back-to-school season, students should be first in line to check out these deals. If you need some new gadgets for college, or refreshed tech to help you out in your first job after graduating, now's the time to see if you can get it for less. Student discounts are handy and exclusive to those who can prove their student status, but the good thing about Labor Day sales is that anyone can take advantage of them — student ID not required.\nBest Labor Day sales: Engadget's top picks\n\n\nApple MacBook Air (13-inch, M4) for $799 ($200 off): Apple's latest MacBook Air is the top pick in our guide to the best laptops, and it earned a score of 92 in our review. The M4 model isn't a major refresh overall, but that's not a bad thing — the design remains exceptionally thin, light and well-built, with long battery life and a top-notch keyboard and trackpad. Now it's a bit faster thanks to the updated chipset. \nApple iPad (11-inch, A16) for $299 ($50 off): Apple's entry-level iPad is, unsurprisingly, the best iPad option for those on a budget. It has solid performance thanks to the A16 chipset, 128GB of storage in the base model and good battery life.\nApple iPad Air (11-inch, M3) for $449 ($150 off): The latest iPad Air is a relatively minor update; the only big addition is a more powerful M3 chip. However, we still recommend this iPad over the base model in our iPad buying guide: Its display is more color-rich and better at fending off glare, its speakers are more robust, it works with Apple’s best accessories and its performance should hold up better in the years ahead.\nCosori 9-in-1 air fryer for $90 (25 percent off): One of our picks for the best air fryers, this Cosori model has a spacious six-quart cooking basket and nine prep modes to choose from. In our testing, it consistently crisped up all kinds of foods, from frozen appetizers to raw proteins, and it has a nifty safety feature with its built-in basket release button.\nSony WH-CH520 wireless headphones for $38 (46 percent off): Sony makes headphones at all price ranges, and the WH-CH520 provides good sound quality and long battery life at an affordable price. They support custom EQ with Sony's mobile app, multipoint connectivity, a built-in microphone and up to 50 hours of battery life.\nAnker MagGo Qi2 10K power bank for $70 (22 percent off): Our current favorite power bank for iPhones, this 10K portable battery attaches magnetically to iPhones and powers them up quickly thanks to Qi2 technology. The built-in kickstand makes it easy to prop up your phone while it's recharging, and the LCD display handily shows you how much power is left in the bank itself.\nAnker Laptop Power Bank (25K, 100W) for $95 (30 percent off): One of our top picks for the best power banks, this 25K brick from Anker has two built-in USB-C cables so you never have to remember to bring one with you. It has a durable build and delivers a speedy charge to all devices, and as the name implies, it can handle powering up items as big as a laptop.\nDyson 360 Vis Nav robot vacuum for $500 ($500 off): Dyson made one of the most impressive robovacs with the 360 Vis Nav. It has some of the strongest suction power of any robot vacuum I've tried, and its impressive obstacle avoidance allows it to move around furniture and other objects with basically not intervention from humans necessary.\nShark AI Ultra robot vacuum for $298 (50 percent off): This Shark robot vacuum is a version of one of our favorites and it comes with a auto-empty base that can hold up to 60 days worth of debris. It has strong suction power and home mapping capabilities, so you can tailor cleaning jobs to your liking in addition to putting the robot on a cleaning schedule.\nEufy 11S Max robot vacuum for $159 (43 percent off): This model is one of our favorite budget robot vacuums thanks to its slim design that lets you get underneath furniture more easily and strong suction power for its size. Note that it does not have Wi-Fi connectivity, but it comes with a remote that lets you control the robot to your liking.\nGoogle Pixel 10 smartphone + $100 Amazon gift card for $799 ($100 off): More of a pre-order deal than a Labor Day deal, this bundle includes a free gift card when you order the latest Google Pixel phone in advance. You'll find different gift card deals at Amazon depending on which phone you go with: the Pixel 10 Pro and Pro XL have a $200 gift cards included, while the Pixel 10 Pro Fold comes with a free $300 gift card.\nAmazon Kindle Colorsoft (16GB) for $220 ($30 off): This is the latest version of Amazon's color ereader that has half of the storage of the original model, but otherwise functions the same. That makes it a little cheaper to start off, but you're still getting a 7-inch color e-paper display, full access to the Kindle shop and a waterproof design. We also appreciate that the Colorsoft comes with no lockscreen ads by default.\nAmazon Kindle (16GB) for $90 (18 percent off): The latest entry-level Kindle has a lightweight, compact design, a six-inch screen with adjustable front light, up to six weeks of battery life and gives you access to the entire Kindle ebook store.\nBlink Outdoor 4 security cameras (3 camera system) for $100 (47 percent off): Some of our favorite security cameras, Blink Outdoor 4 devices support 1080p video, two-way talk, motion alerts and night vision. The most convenient thing about these is that they're totally wireless and run on AA batteries that can last up to two years before you need to replace them. That combined with their weather-proof design allows you to place them both inside and outside.\nESPN Unlimited with Disney+ and Hulu (with ads) for $30/month ($6/month off): ESPN’s new streaming service is officially available now, and new subscribers can get Disney+ and Hulu included for one year when they sign up. The regular price of the new ESPN Unlimited plan is $30 per month, but this bundle offer throws in Disney+ and Hulu (with ads) for one year at no extra cost. If you want to break it down, you’re essentially getting each of the three services for $10 monthly with this offer.\nNordVPN deal — Get up to 77 percent off two-year plans: Most of NordVPN's two-year plans are on sale right now. You'll get 77 percent off the Prime tier, bringing the price down to $189 for 27 months of service (Nord throws in an extra three months for free). Arguably the best plan for most people is the Plus tier, which is 73 percent off and down to $108 for the 27-month term.\nMasterClass deal — Get 50 percent off one-year subscriptions: You can sign up for one year of MasterClass access for as low as $5 per month thanks to this sale that runs through September 1. A subscription lets you watch hundreds of online video classes taught by experts in their fields, and subject matter ranges from writing to cooking to sports.\nBest Labor Day sales on tech\n\nApple 24-inch iMac (M4) for $1,149 ($150 off)\n8Bitdo Ultimate 2C Wired Controller for $15 (25 percent off)\nXbox wireless gaming controller for $54 (17 percent off)\nJBL Go 4 portable speaker for $45 (10 percent off)\nRoku Ultra streamer for $79 (21 percent off)\nSony WH-1000XM4 wireless headphones for $198 (43 percent off)\nGovee RGBIC Floor Lamp Basic for $60 (40 percent off)\nAmazon Fire Max 11 tablet for $175 (24 percent off)\nNothing Headphones (1) for $269 ($30 off)\n\nMore Labor Day sales\n\nAmazon Labor Day sale: Get up to 40 percent off headphones, earbuds, tech accessories and more\nBest Buy Labor Day sale: Get up to 50 percent off appliances, laptops, TVs, smartphones and more\nWalmart Labor Day sale: Save hundreds on electronics including TVs, laptops, headphones and more\nDyson Labor Day sale: Save up to $500 on vacuums, hair care and more\nSonos Labor Day sale: Save up to 25 percent on headphones and speakers\nTherabody Labor Day sale: Save up to $150 on percussion massage guns and more\nOoni Labor Day sale: Get 20 percent off the Koda 2 Max and save on other pizza ovens\nSolo Stove Labor Day sale: Get 20 percent off fire pits and 15 percent off select accessories\nMeater Labor Day sale: Get up to 27 percent off smart meat thermometers\n\nFollow @EngadgetDeals on X for the latest tech deals and buying advice.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-labor-day-sales-for-2025-tech-from-apple-dyson-sony-and-others-is-up-to-50-percent-off-120049457.html?src=rss",

    "full_text": "Any way you look at it, it sounds very good for its size and puts out a surprising amount of quality bass while offering good treble detail and natural-sounding mids (where vocals live). Sonos Roam: Available in white or black for $179, the Roam is currently the smallest and most affordable Sonos speaker (if you don't count those $99 Sonos-compatible Symfonisk Ikea Wi-Fi bookshelf speakers), although it's fairly expensive for a mini wireless speaker. Besides sounding decent for streaming your favorite music and more, this affordable Bluetooth speaker is also fully waterproof. (There's a companion app for iOS and Android that allows you to alter the colorful lighting effects.) Its 2-inch full-range driver and two passive radiators put out more sound than you'd think it would for its tiny size, and it offers decent clarity as well as just enough bass to avoid sounding tinny (you can choose from three preset sound modes). Bang & Olufsen Beosound A1 (2nd Gen): A couple of years ago, Bang & Olufsen upgraded its dome-shaped aluminum-clad A1 speaker with improved battery life, better speakerphone performance (it now has a three-microphone array) and slightly improved sound. You can learn more about the small-but-mighty B&O Beousound A1 in our full review. It's a good value thanks to its ability to play big sound with strong bass and decent clarity, with 50 watts of power that drives a 5.25-inch \"concave aluminum cone woofer\" flanked by two 1-inch silk-dome tweeters. Additionally, it can be used as a power bank to charge your mobile devices. Tribit's XSound speakers are probably a better value, but the StormBox is more stylish."

    "summary": "If you've put off getting a new MacBook then Labor Day sales might be just what you needed to take the plunge. Right now, the 2025 13- and 15-inch MacBook Air M4 are available on Amazon for record-low prices. The 13-inch model is our pick for best MacBook to buy this year, and it's one of the best laptops for college students going back to school soon as well.\nYou can pick up the 13-inch MacBook Air M4 for $799, down from $999 — a 20 percent discount. This model comes with 16GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD. You can upgrade to 512GB SSD for $999, down from $1,199, another all-time low price, or 24GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD for $1,199, down from $1,399. \n \nThen there's the 15-inch MacBook Air M4, whose cheapest model is on sale for $999, dropping from $1,199. The 17 percent discount is the best deal we've seen since the pair debuted in March. As with the 13-inch model, the 16GB and 512GB SSD option is also a record-low price, dropping to $1,199 from $1,399. Then there's the 24GB upgrade, which is $1,399, down from $1,599.\nWe're big fans of the MacBook Air M4, giving it a 92 in our review. Part of that comes from an already lower starting price for the MacBooks than their predecessors. The 2025 models also get a speed boost thanks to the M4 chip and are very thin with a 0.44-inch thickness. Neither the 13- or 15-inch will drag you down, weighing 2.7 pounds and 3.2 pounds, respectively. Plus, they both have excellent battery life, lasting over 18 hours while playing an HD video. \nThe big differences in the 15-inch model mostly come down to size. The screen is obviously bigger, as is its trackpad.

The side of my campervan makes for a decent impromptu projector screen. Something else you'll want to keep in mind: This projector doesn't show full frame with a USB-to-HDMI. While you wouldn't want to backpack with it, the Mars 3 Air is compact and shorter than my Jetboil MiniMo camp stove. There are two other options I want to talk about that might be better in certain situations. It also has Google TV built in, is battery powered, can double as a Bluetooth speaker and (unlike the Mars 3 Air) it can charge via USB-C. That means you can have longer viewing sessions between charges as long as you have a battery bank. It also has extremely loud fans and the streaming options are far more limited."

Read on to catch up on the reviews you might've missed over the last few weeks.\nGoogle Pixel 10 Pro and Pro XL\n \nIf you've never really felt like your \"smartphone\" was all that \"smart,\" senior reviews writer Sam Rutherford argued that Google has finally achieved the feat. Arguably, the best aspects of the Pixel 10 Pro and Pro XL come down to their AI features, especially Google's Magic Cue. \"Now that we can look back at 10 generations of devices, Google’s overarching strategy is more convincing than ever,\" he said. \"For the Pixel 10 Pro and 10 Pro XL, the company has combined iterative hardware upgrades with a solid (and attractive) design while its software and AI continues to outpace its rivals.\" \nGoogle Pixel 10\n \nIf the Pixel 10 Pro duo is finally putting the \"smart\" in \"smartphone,\" UK bureau chief Mat Smith concluded that the Pixel 10 has redefined base-level flagship phones. A more capable camera, more power and Qi2 support mean you might not be as tempted by those pricer models. \"The Pixel 10 is a substantial upgrade from the Pixel 9, although given it has the Tensor G5 chip, it’s a shame that software features like Zoom Enhance from last year’s Pixels didn’t make the cut,\" he said. \"Unless you’re a die-hard smartphone gamer, there isn’t a more capable smartphone at this price.\"\nBose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds (2nd gen)\n \nThe second-generation of Bose's QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds aren't a complete overhaul, but they didn't necessarily need to be. The company strengthened its already outstanding active noise cancellation while enhancing call clarity and making several other adjustments. \"Simply put, the QC Ultra Earbuds remain the best option for wireless noise-cancelling earbuds, and that’s not likely to change anytime soon,\" I said.\nSony RX1R III\n \nSometimes the wait for a new model can be excruciating. That anticipation turns to disappointment when the long-awaited update doesn't impress. That's how senior reporter Igor Bonifacic felt when he finally got his hands on the RX1R III. \"It’s missing a handful of features the company really should have included for it to hold its own against other high-end compact cameras,\" he said. \"I love the RX1R III, but I wish it was easier to recommend.\"This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/engadget-review-recap-pixel-10-phones-bose-earbuds-and-a-sony-camera-130051534.html?src=rss",

Instead of starting up your own business from scratch, Discounty has you taking over a grocery franchise from your cranky aunt in a small town that has seen better days. As you progress, your shop will expand both in terms of what you can sell and its physical size, which in turn makes the core gameplay loop more complex and challenging. Working with local vendors usually means doing them some kind of favor, whether it’s finding some lost sheep or stocking gross Christmas-themed fish sticks. This can pull you down all kinds of narrative rabbit holes. What’s most interesting about Discounty’s story is how it explores a number of real-world issues in its otherwise cozy and silly world. For starters, not everyone is happy about a big chain moving into town. When I finally expanded my shop’s footprint, usually a moment to celebrate in these kinds of games, everyone was mad because I did it by taking over an adjacent tea shop. And while these threads often hide their darker edge behind humor — in order to get a construction permit, I had to help a city clerk dispose of environmental impact reports — Discounty is surprisingly sharp with its commentary, even if it never goes especially hard at any of its targets.

    "summary": "Apple confirmed last Tuesday that its iPhone 17 event will be on Tuesday, September 9 at 1PM ET. We're getting excited because that means we'll finally get to put our eyes on the iPhone 17 lineup. The new smartphones will come equipped with the latest iOS 26 features preinstalled — and any new features Apple reveals that day. But since we still have to wait a couple of weeks until the iPhone event, we can only speculate what the new devices will look like. As with most unreleased iPhones, rumors and leaks have trickled in about the hardware side ahead of the official introduction. Here's what we're expecting and what we can reasonably assume we'll get from Apple in September.\nWhat are the latest iPhone 17 rumors?\nWhen it comes to deep reporting from inside Apple, Bloomberg's Mark Gurman is the go-to journalist — and he was the guest on the latest Engadget Podcast. In his sit-down with Engadget's Devindra Hardawar and Igor Bonifacic, Gurman said the rumored iPhone Air will be rough around the edges at first. He believes the 17 Air will \"lag in both\" when it comes to camera and battery performance. \"The battery life is going to be subpar compared to a base-level 17 or Pro model,\" he says. The ultimate goal, he notes, is to get all the functionality of the Pro models into the Air models.\nGurman also noted that the iPhone Air is less of a destination and more of a waypoint on the path to that long-rumored foldable iPhone. \"The Air is a stepping stone toward that foldable... we'll get that next year.\" \nThese rumors haven't been confirmed by Apple and we won't know what the actual iPhone 17 models will look like until the iPhone event next month. \nHow much will the iPhone 17 cost?\nApple's announced plan to expand US-based manufacturing partners seems to give it at least some shielding from the steepest Trump administration tariffs that have already triggered price increases on everything from PlayStations to Switch consoles to high-end cameras to Sonos speakers. But given that President Trump's trade policies can change from week to week, and Apple's continuing reliance on Asia-based supply chains, price shocks remain an ongoing possibility. The bigger question is: Will Apple absorb any higher costs, or pass them on to consumers? \nIf prices do creep up, Apple may choose to pair it with an \"upgrade.\" Consider this recent rumor posted by MacRumors from a leaker known as \"Instant Digital,\" suggesting that the default storage of the iPhone 17 line may start at 256GB, doubling the current 128GB baseline. While that could be accompanied by a price increase of $50, Apple could at least pitch it as a \"better value.\" That said, the company doubled the default RAM of its Mac computers from 8GB to 16GB at no extra cost in 2024 — but that was before the current Trump tariff cycle started.\nWhen will the iPhone 17 series be announced?\nMost years, the flagship smartphones are introduced in September. MacRumors highlighted a story originally reported by iphone-ticker.de that the Apple iPhone 17 event could be Tuesday, September 9, according to information gleaned from German mobile phone providers.\nIt's still too early to have the specific dates; some years, Apple only gives a week or two of lead time between sending invites and hosting the event. But years of past precedent show that sometime in September should be when the 17 models make their debut. This family of smartphones may be the last to follow that trend, however. There have been hints that the introduction of the iPhone 18 collection in 2026 will be split into a pro-tier announcement in the fall and a standard model announcement the following spring.\nWhat will the new iPhone 17 lineup include?\nDesign leaks suggest that Apple is building an ultra-thin smartphone, likely to be named the iPhone 17 Air to match Apple's ultralight laptop designation. Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, often a solid source of advanced intel about Apple, reported in January that the iPhone 17 Air will be equipped with a basic A19 chip and will only have a single camera lens. It may also use Apple's new in-house modem, which was introduced in February on the iPhone 16e. More details about this development may leak ahead of September, but that's what we know for now.\nAn investor note from Apple analyst Jeff Pu indicated that the Air will have a titanium frame. If his reports are accurate, the lightweight smartphone will be the only entry in the iPhone 17 lineup to use that metal; the iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone 17 Pro Max are expected to be made of aluminum, which is oddly a lighter material than titanium. Other speculation had suggested that the Air would use a blend of aluminum and titanium, so the exact materials may not be known until the official announcement.\nAfter the announcement dropped Tuesday for the official iPhone 17 event, MacRumors speculates the Apple logo says a lot about the new iPhones. Apple's logo \"hints at two rumored iPhone 17 Pro features.\" The logo shows bright orange and dark blue colors, rumored to be two of the iPhone 17 Pro colors, so they could be onto something. They also noticed it looks like an infrared heat map, hinting at the vapor chamber cooling system.\nAdditionally, an August 4 MacRumors report says the internal battery pack of the iPhone Air is just 2.49mm thick — half the thickness of the iPhone 17 Pro battery. The leak was posted on the Korean-language Naver blog, where they show the alleged batteries of the iPhone 17 Air and 17 Pro side by side. The same account claimed the 17 Air's battery capacity was a mere 2,800 mAh, MacRumors notes. (That's below the battery capacity of current iPhone 16 models.)\nOn a similar topic, an iPhone 17 Pro production leak appears to have revealed an all-aluminum chassis, according to MacRumors. Originally posted by leaker Majin Bu, the image shows a shell that has a large round hole on the back (where the Apple logo typically is) to allow for MagSafe charging. MacRumors says this could just be a molding but notes that the aluminum frame (versus the current titanium in Pro iPhone models) would yield a significantly lower weight.\nThat same leaker (Majin Bu), whom MacRumors classifies as a \"hit-or-miss leaker,\" suggests the iPhone 17 Pro will have better wireless signal strength thanks to an updated antenna design. The individual posted a render on X that shows a new antenna system that wraps around the iPhone 17 Pro's supposedly wider rear camera bump. Again, this is a render, not a real-world photo. That said, we can't knock the goal of better wireless reception, so we're hoping this one has a degree of truth to it.\nLeaker Majin Bu also claims \"TechWoven\" cases could be introduced, per a MacRumors report. The cases match the rumored design on the iPhone 17 models, with the wide camera bump. The leaker noted there are two lanyard holes for \"convenient and secure carrying,\" so it could be worn around your neck. The colors would come in grey/black, blue, green, purple and orange. Additionally, he says there will be new Liquid Silicone cases in eight colors, including Deep Orange, Pale Orange, Grass Green, Celadon, Fog Purple, Grey Blue, Dark Blue and Midnight Black. \nEach new roster includes a base model, but over the years, Apple has shaken up the variety of phones it offers. Most likely there will be an iPhone 17 and an iPhone 17 Pro. Apple has also committed to the size matters philosophy, and has been building an iPhone Pro Max option with an even bigger screen and better battery life; the 17 roster will almost certainly have one as well. \nThe new Pro iPhones are said to have a full-width \"camera island\" on the rear, which would mark the first time an Apple model opted for that design. This feature can be seen in the purported iPhone 17 \"spotted in the wild.\" The pics, highlighted on MacRumors, show a black cased iPhone (17 Pro?) with the distinct back panel. Is it the real deal? The dual angles lend a degree of credibility in a social media landscape increasingly polluted with AI-enhanced fakes, but your guess is as good as ours.\nI just spotted a test development iPhone in the wild 🤩🤩🤩 pic.twitter.com/iS3PtKWqxJ— Fox Pupy 🦊🧡 (@Skyfops) July 28, 2025\n\nThe iPhone 17 Air seems primed to take the place of a potential iPhone 17 Plus. Since the iPhone 16e was only just introduced in February at a surprisingly high price point, it seems unlikely that there will be a new addition to that lower end of the spectrum, the models that were previously called SE. \nAt the very least, it sounds like the iPhone 17 Air won't take away the charging port and rely only on wireless connectivity. Bloomberg said that while Apple had investigated making the iPhone 17 Air without a single port, the company (fortunately) changed plans. He also says that the rumored phone will have a 6.6-inch screen and include the Dynamic Island and Camera Control button. Finally, the price is rumored at $900 — likely more than the standard iPhone 17 but less than the Pro.\nWe've also gotten what seems to be a reliable look at what the color lineup will be for the new smartphones. Macworld reported that the iPhone 17 will be available in black, white, steel gray, green, purple and light blue. The iPhone 17 Air will reportedly have four color options: black, white, light blue and light gold. While the Air colors will be less saturated, the visuals for the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max will go bold. The options for the Pro models are expected to be black, white, gray, dark blue and orange.\nBloomberg's Mark Gurman believes there actually will be a new orange color offered for the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max, as well as a light blue color for the iPhone 17 Air, he confirmed in his weekly Power On newsletter.\nOn July 30, Tom's Guide highlighted an X post from Sonny Dickson — a longtime and generally reliable leaker of unreleased iPhone information — showing \"dummy\" iPhone 17 models in the new colors that were the source of the aforementioned Macworld story. While these are literally just mock-ups — not real, leaked iPhones — it's interesting to see how the design and color rumors translate into a real-world look and feel.\nTo add the the rumors, a Weibo leaker known as Digital Chat Station suggests the iPhone 17e will come equipped with a new design that includes the Dynamic Island, MacRumors reports. According to the post, the new phone will have the A19 chip and could have a 6.1-inch OLED display with a front-facing 12-megapixel camera and a rear-facing 48-megapixel camera. However, it's important to note this report refers to the 17e model that would be expected to launch no earlier than February 2026, if it followed the same release pattern as the iPhone 16e.\nWhat will iOS 26 be like?\nApple upended its numbering conventions with WWDC 2025, and will match the name of each new operating system to the year it's released. So when the next wave of iPhones hits, they'll be running on iOS 26.\nOn the design side, the smartphone OS introduced during the big developer showcase took a contentious approach dubbed Liquid Glass. Apple has been scaling down the amount of transparency effects in the subsequent beta tests of iOS 26, but it will still have a glass-like visual.\nThe feature list includes big and small updates. On the more impactful side, the Phone and Photos apps have been redesigned. There will be several features leveraging artificial intelligence, such as live translation capabilities coming to Phone, FaceTime and Messages. Apple is also currently testing a sensitive content warning for child accounts that will freeze FaceTime video if nudity is detected by on-device machine learning tools. And the company is also launching Visual Intelligence, which will use AI to search for elements in an image.\niOS 26 also has a litany of minor, quality of life improvements. Group texts are getting support for polls. And for the slow risers out there, iOS 26 will finally let you escape the tyranny of the nine minute snooze alarm. \nThe next iOS is now available as a public beta. Here are our initial impressions of the Liquid Glass design and other new features. iOS 26 is compatible with all models back through iPhone 11.\nWhat other products are expected to be released alongside the iPhone 17?\nIf Apple follows its usual pattern, the iPhone 17 will be announced alongside new Apple Watch products. That would be the Apple Watch Series 11 (if Apple sticks to the same naming scheme), and maybe an Apple Watch Ultra 3 and/or an updated Apple Watch SE. (They'll all run watchOS 26, of course.) Other possibilities — and this is, again, speculation — could include refreshed Apple AirPods Pro (which received its last big update in 2022) and maybe new AirTags trackers (first released in 2021).\nThe Apple rumor mill got a big shot in the arm this week thanks to the reported inclusion of product ID numbers in recent beta software builds. Per MacRumors, it's a laundry list of new hardware, including long-rumored product updates like the Apple TV, HomePod mini, new Apple Studio Display monitor and two fresh iPads. \nOf course, even if that list is totally accurate, we may not see those products until 2026 — if ever. So don't expect all of products to share the stage with the iPhone 17, especially since Apple likes to keep its star performer at the center of attention. \nThat said, keep in mind that Apple has recently been having Mac-centric announcements in late October (as it did last year to debut new M4 Macs), so there's always the chance of another shoe dropping a few weeks down the road.  \nUpdate, August 30, 2025, 8:45AM ET: Added commentary from Mark Gurman's guest appearance on the Engadget Podcast about the rumored iPhone 17 Air.\nUpdate, August 27, 2025, 5:44PM ET: Added official Apple iPhone 17 event date, and a rumor about its event logo.\nUpdate, August 25, 2025, 5:15PM ET: Added new reports about the iPhone 17 Pro's orange color as well as new rumored Liquid Silicone cases.\nUpdate, August 22, 2025, 11:52AM ET: Added new details about the colors of the rumored TechWoven case.\nUpdate, August 20, 2025, 7:12PM ET: Added new rumor about potential TechWoven case for iPhone 17 series.\nUpdate, August 18, 2025, 6:23PM ET: Added new rumor about the iPhone 17e potentially having the Dynamic Island.\nUpdate, August 15, 2025, 2:05PM ET: Added new rumor about the all-aluminum chassis on the iPhone 17.\nUpdate, August 13, 2025, 10:02PM ET: Added a list of the products that are expected to be released alongside the iPhone 17s. \nUpdate, August 11, 2025, 7:27PM ET: Added a render of a rumored new antenna design for the iPhone 17 Pro.\nUpdate, August 8, 2025, 4:43PM ET: Added new speculation and reports about iPhone 17 pricing.\nUpdate, August 6, 2025, 4:05PM ET: Added latest details about the potential iPhone 17 event date.\nUpdate, August 4, 2025, 5:23PM ET: Added latest battery leaks about the iPhone 17 models.\nUpdate, August 1, 2025, 8:15AM ET: Added new photos showing potential iPhone 17 colors.\nUpdate, July 30, 2025, 11:08AM ET: Added latest leaks and rumors about the iPhone 17, and updated information on the iOS 26 public beta.\nUpdate, July 17, 2025, 4:40PM ET: Added latest information about iOS 26, possible materials for the Air, and the color options for the different models.\nUpdate, March 17, 2025, 2PM ET: Added details about the rumored price and features of the iPhone 17 Air.\nUpdate, April 11, 2025, 3:45PM ET: Added details from Front Page Tech's new video that claims to reveal details from a leaked iOS 19 build.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/iphone-17-rumors-prices-new-features-and-everything-else-you-need-to-know-before-the-september-9-apple-event-153024206.html?src=rss",

As for where to pull over, there are a few things that definitively go into Waymo’s parking choices. First is “local parking regulations,” so that includes the actual curb restrictions such as time limits or street sweeping. “And it seems that they are currently not optimizing to vary the location for whatever reason.” Koopman says that while Waymo may not have insight into how the cars are arriving at their parking choices, they absolutely understand what it’s basing those decisions on. Delgin and Tucker have been mostly amused, though sometimes annoyed by the car taking up a spot. The police departments of Los Angeles and Phoenix weren’t able to say whether they had gotten any general “loitering” complaints, as these types of information requests require that inquiries be pinpointed to specific locations."

    "summary": "Welcome to our latest recap of what's going on in the indie game space. One very well-known indie found its way to iOS devices this week, though there are other new releases worth highlighting and plenty of other upcoming games to tell you about.\nFirst, though, there was a (paywalled) story in Game File this week that caught my eye. It's about how Google's AI Overviews feature offers up false video game tips. That's a problem the developers of a game called Trash Goblin — a cosy shopkeeping game in which you chip away at junk to unearth trinkets you can restore and sell — have been dealing with.\nAI Overviews offered incorrect information about the game to some players, as well as the crew at Spilt Milk Studios when they tested the responses. For instance, AI Overviews suggested that a player could damage a trinket when they were removing debris from it, which is not true. It also in some cases delivered the correct information, but pointed the user to an incorrect source. In addition, AI Overviews offered information about another game entirely. This is obviously not ideal for players or the team behind Trash Goblin. \nWe've seen many cases in which AI Overviews get information blatantly wrong. Like other large language models (LLMs), it guesses what the next word or words should be in its responses based on its training data. LLMs are about generating sequences of text; they're not designed to deliver facts (one reason why there's a disclaimer on AI Overviews that reads “AI responses may include mistakes\"). They often just make stuff up.\nIf you're looking for help with a game, you're far better off finding a community of players you can chat to. You might be able to find a clear, helpful guide to the game in question on an actual video game website, written by a professional video game guide writer. If, that is, you can evade AI Overviews to get to those websites in the first place (thankfully, it's easy to turn off AI Overviews for your Google searches).\nNew releases\n\nIO Interactive is independent, which means Hitman World of Assassination fits within our remit here. This week, the bundle of three core Hitman games from the last decade arrived on iPhone (iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max, as well as the iPhone 16 lineup) and iPad. Supported iPad models are iPad Pro and iPad Air (M1 chip or later), as well as the A17 Pro iPad mini.\nHitman World of Assassination is a sandbox stealth game in which you're given a mission (usually taking out a target) and it's up to you how to carry that out. Getting to know the layout of each level so you can plan your approach and escape is key. Understanding the route and actions of the NPCs will stand you in good stead too.\nThe iPhone and iPad versions have touch controls with context-sensitive buttons. You can, of course, opt to use a third-party controller instead. IOI says it tapped into Apple's MetalFX tech to help ensure the iOS port looks good.\nHitman World of Assassination costs $70 on iOS. That's fairly steep, but IOI says the game offers over 100 hours of gameplay. Alternatively, you can play the first location for free, and buy any of the 24 levels individually for $3 each. \nIn addition, the game is coming to Apple Silicon Macs later this year. IOI will also bring the roguelite Freelancer mode to the iPhone and iPad versions down the line with a free update.\n\nAnother game landed on new platforms this week as Alawar's Karate Survivor hit PlayStation, Xbox and Nintendo Switch for $6. As the title suggests, this is a survivor-style martial arts beat-'em-up. \nYou'll be able to use the environment to your advantage by picking up items to use as melee or projectile weapons, kicking objects toward goons and swinging locker and microwave doors into bad guys' mushes. You can unlock hundreds of different moves and there are permanent upgrades as well.\n\nFirst-person action-adventure Davy x Jones has set sail in early access on Steam. Until September 4, you can snap it up for $6.66. After that time, it will cost $10. However, the price will increase ahead of the game's full release on PC and consoles, which is slated for late 2026.\nIn this early version, you'll have access to the main gameplay and combat systems (including legendary weapons), several islands, an array of enemies and some cinematic executions — hopefully involving a kraken. You'll take command of a half-ship, half-whale vessel called Abby as you attempt to escape the underworld and seek revenge as the legendary pirate.\n\nRegular readers of this roundup will know that I'm a sucker for a game with a great title. Prop Haunt, which riffs on the prop hunt modes in many other games, is definitely one of those (as is another one I'll mention later on).\nThis is a spooky 1 vs. 4 multiplayer horror title from Silent Forest Games that just hit Steam early access for $15. The ghost players possess objects and it's up to the investigator to find and stop them. The ghosties can teleport, blend into their surroundings and so on, while the investigator has cameras and other gizmos at their disposal\nCurrently, there are four playable ghosts with different haunting styles, two maps and support for public and private lobbies. More maps, ghost powers, investigator tools and procedural prop generation are in the works.\nUpcoming\n\nBye Sweet Carole had flown below my radar until the release date trailer popped up but, goodness, does it look gorgeous. The team at Little Sewing Machine took a hand-drawn approach to the art of this narrative-horror game, which mimics the look of classic animated films. Even the song in the trailer aligns with the type of showtune you'd hear in Disney movies.\nYou'll take on the role of Lana Benton, a young girl who sets out to find out the truth about her best friend Carole's disappearance from an orphanage. It sounds (and looks!) pretty promising. Publisher Maximum Entertainment is bringing Bye Sweet Carole to PS5, Nintendo Switch, Xbox Series X/S and PC on October 9.\n\nRita is an interesting-looking puzzle game from SporkTank (aka solo developer Martin Stradling). You play as a chick that uses letters found in the environment to solve word puzzles, including crosswords, in order to progress. For instance, you might need to fill in a crossword answer for \"stairs\" in order to spawn a staircase (perhaps there's a bit of a Baba is You influence here?). There are some platforming elements too.\nYou'll follow Rita throughout her journey from exploring as a young chick to becoming a grandparent. It all seems quite lovely. Rita is coming to Steam early next year. A demo will be available on September 18.\n\nCo-op survival game Lost Skies is set to exit Steam early access on September 17. Set on an archipelago of sky islands, you can explore this world with up to five buddies and try to learn exactly what led to this fractured civilization. You have a grappling hook, wingsuits and gliders to help you traverse these landforms and a customizable and upgradeable skyship that you'll use for both transportation and combat. Players can also create their own islands, which they can share with the community.\nI never got around to checking out the demo for Lost Skies, even though I've had it installed on my PC for months. Still, this one from Bossa Studios and publisher Humble Games has me intrigued enough to perhaps try out the full game.\n\nAnother game I've had my eye on for a hot minute is Bloodthief, which will debut on Steam on September 22. This is a Ghostrunner-inspired medieval parkour-slasher game from first-time game creator Blargis (Jake Bedard), who has been sharing development updates on YouTube over the last couple of years.\nIn Bloodthief, you play as an agile vampire and use the blood of your enemies to enhance your speed, abilities and survival. For example, attacks help boost your momentum. I'm definitely looking forward to watching some speedruns of this because I'm fairly sure that, as with the Ghostrunner games, I'm going to be absolutely terrible at this.\n\nWhile you're waiting (im)patiently for the full release of Hades 2, you might like to check out a similar flavor of isometric roguelite action — albeit with the addition of co-op. In Sworn, you'll set out to save Camelot from a corrupted Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table with the help of up to three other players.\nSworn has been in early access since last year, and you won't have to wait much longer for the full game. It'll be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch and Steam on September 25.\n\nLet's wrap things up for this week with another game that has a fantastic title. The Hero is too Powerful so let's Pleeeease Settle this Peacefully! is the latest project from Night Stroll Studio (solo developer Trevor Thompson). It's an RPG in the vein of early Zelda games in which you play as a hero who has exactly one attack.\nHowever, you can level up this attack to the point that it's obscenely powerful. There's also the option of talking your way out of sticky situations. This comedy adventure, which has maybe my favorite title of any game this side of I'm Going to Die if I Don't Eat Sushi!, is slated to hit Steam later this year.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/hitman-on-ios-martial-arts-survival-and-other-new-indie-games-worth-checking-out-110054545.html?src=rss",

When I spoke with Saatchi recently, he admitted to being a bit too high on his own supply during his time with Oculus and deeply humbled when that version of the company ultimately came to an end. But the character was limited to reciting canned bits of dialogue rather than responding with context-specific speech. This hurdle got Saatchi thinking more seriously about how he might be able to build Lucy as a complex “digital being” capable of having complicated interactions with people. “We made Lucy into a character that you can talk to and video chat with,” Saatchi said. I feel like the industry is kind of cutting off that exploratory element with generative AI by just shoving it into movies.” When I brought up the ongoing conversation about gen AI’s potential to put people in creative fields out of work, Saatchi said what almost everyone in his position says — that he sees Showrunner as a platform that’s meant to supplement traditionally produced entertainment rather than replace it. “If all that we can do with such a powerful technology is just cut jobs, what was the point? “These models would have real characters and a world that could be explored through prompting, and you could also inadvertently trigger scenes within those worlds in a way that would make it feel as though you’re uncovering something unknown.” But he agreed when I pointed out that the system he’s describing makes it sound like Showrunner would effectively turn its subscribers into unpaid employees working for some of Hollywood’s biggest and most powerful studios."

And for our commercial customers, Windows 11, version 25H2 includes the ability for IT admins to remove select pre-installed Microsoft Store apps via Group Policy/MDM CSP on Enterprise/EDU devices. As Microsoft detailed in June, using its shared servicing branch means updating from the current 24H2 version to 25H2 takes a single restart, as new features are added in earlier updates but left disabled until the enablement package activates them.

Supporters of the new agreement say it could give drivers a stronger voice in pushing back against unfair treatment. “Some drivers fear getting deactivated and losing their jobs, so we often feel pressured to stay silent instead of demanding fair treatment."

    "summary": "We're now less than two weeks away from the Apple iPhone 17 event. Themed \"Awe dropping\" this year, the event — confirmed after Apple sent \"save the date\" invitations to the media on August 26 — will be livestreamed on YouTube September 9 at 1PM ET from Cupertino. And Engadget staff will be there, reporting and liveblogging from Apple Park to give their hands-on impressions. This year is shaking up to be a departure from recent September product rollouts, with the strong possibility of an all-new superthin iPhone expected to join the company's lineup. Also on tap could be new Apple Watch models — including the first truly new Ultra model in two years — and (maybe) the long-awaited AirPods Pro 3.\nWe got a full rundown of what to expect at the event from the best possible source: Bloomberg Apple reporter extraordinaire Mark Gurman. During his recent guest appearance on the Engadget Podcast, Gurman shared his analysis of what we expect to see, including the expected battery and camera compromises of that rumored thin iPhone (which everyone already calls the iPhone Air). \n\n\n\nExpected to be roughly 5.55 mm thick, the iPhone Air would be the thinnest iPhone yet, besting 2014's iPhone 6 which, at 6.9 mm, was the previous svelteness champ. And they've only gotten chunkier since then. (The iPhone 16 Pro has a depth of 8.25 mm.) The Air would also give Apple a direct rival to Samsung's Galaxy S25 Edge, which we found to be more than a gimmick.\nApple (screenshot)\nBut the iPhone Air's thin design will likely lead to some compromises. It's rumored to have only a single 48 MP camera and a smaller battery. So, expect a stylish phone that... won't be for everyone.\nThe Pro lineup could offer some design tweaks and performance improvements. The iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max are rumored to switch from titanium to aluminum. They could also see the rear camera array expand to an entire \"island\" that extends across most of the phone's backside. It's expected to house three cameras (as before), but multiple rumors have suggested it will have an improved telephoto one. The zoom lens could jump to 48MP, which would strengthen its digital zooming / cropping chops. The phones may also add an anti-glare coating, similar to those found on iPads.\nThe standard iPhone 17 could see some welcome display upgrades. At least one supply chain source claimed it will add a 120Hz variable refresh rate (ProMotion) display, which the Pro series has used since 2021.\nApple\nOne thing we know without a doubt is that the new iPhones will launch with iOS 26, which brings Apple's biggest design refresh in years. It's easy to imagine the company highlighting the new model's displays as the best way to experience the new Liquid Glass visual language. As for the naming scheme, there haven't been any leaks pointing to a similar hardware rebranding (\"iPhone 26,\" \"iPhone 26 Pro,\" etc.). But hey, Apple does like surprises.\nEngadget's iPhone 17 rumor roundup gives you a deeper dive into what to expect from the new models.\nCherlynn Low for Engadget\nApple's fall event isn't just for iPhones. The company is also expected to roll out new Apple Watch models. 5G and a processor upgrade are expected for the Apple Watch Ultra 3. It may also let you send texts via satellite, handy for those who use it out in the wilderness. Regardless of the details, Apple hasn't launched a new rugged and premium model since 2023 (apart from a new color), so it's due for an upgrade.\nThe Series 11 model is unlikely to depart dramatically from the Series 10. After all, that model introduced a new design, with a thinner body and larger screen. (And Apple has historically kept those around in three-year cycles.). But a faster chip also seems logical. Perhaps we'll see 5G arrive on the standard wearable, too.\nWe may also see the AirPods Pro 3 at the event. It's been about three years since Apple last upgraded its premium earbuds. The new model could also bring some biometric sensors to the earphones: an in-ear heart-rate monitor and (maybe) temperature sensing. Live translation is also rumored, although that may not be exclusive to the third-gen model. But don't expect major design changes, if the latest reports from leaker Majin Bu (via MacRumors) are to be believed: In addition to a \"slight reduction in size,\" Bu notes the case will lose the physical pairing button, while gaining capacitive controls.\nWill there be other announcements? Time will tell, but now we know we won't have to wait long to find out. The official countdown clock has begun, and the answers are just days away.\nUpdate, August 29, 2025, 2:32PM ET: Added insights from Bloomberg's Mark Gurman based on his appearance on the Engadget Podcast.\nUpdate, August 28, 2025, 10:45AM ET: Added new report on AirPods 3 case details. \nUpdate, August 26, 2025, 5:41PM ET: Added confirmation of official event invitation, date and time. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/apples-iphone-17-awe-dropping-event-is-on-september-9--heres-what-we-expect-090059664.html?src=rss",

As we continue to refine our systems, we’re adding more guardrails as an extra precaution — including training our AIs not to engage with teens on these topics, but to guide them to expert resources, and limiting teen access to a select group of AI characters for now.\"\nNotably, the new protections are described as being in place \"for now,\" as Meta is apparently still working on more permanent measures to address growing concerns around teen safety and its AI. \"These updates are already in progress, and we will continue to adapt our approach to help ensure teens have safe, age-appropriate experiences with AI,” Otway said. The new protections will be rolling out over the next few weeks and apply to all teen users using Meta AI in English-speaking countries.\nMeta's policies have also caught the attention of lawmakers and other officials, with Senator Josh Hawley recently telling the company he planned to launch an investigation over its handling of such interactions.

There were plenty of more unusual ideas, too: Honor used the show to introduce a laptop with a detachable webcam, for example.\nBased on the companies that are confirmed to have presence at the show, similar themes will be woven through IFA 2025. AI and features enabled by it will likely be everywhere, especially in home appliances. Laptops, whether they're running Intel's Panther Lake chips or something Arm-based, are sure to be in the mix. And smart glasses will likely continue to be a going concern. Below are the companies who are confirmed to be holding events at the show, and what we think they might announce.\nSamsung\nSamsung\nWith the Galaxy S25, Galaxy Z foldables and Galaxy Watch 8 in the rear view, there aren't many personal electronics Samsung has left to announce this year. That could be why the company's IFA press conference seems focused on the smart home. Samsung's IFA presentation, dubbed \"AI Home: Future Living, Now\" is supposed to be focused on the company's home appliances. Specifically, Samsung says it will \"highlight the transformative potential of AI in the home.\" Samsung already showed off how AI plays into its new Bespoke AI home appliances at CES 2025, so it's possible the company could have new additions to the lineup. It'll hopefully also share when its Ballie robot will be available for purchase.\nWe also know for a fact that Samsung is hosting a virtual Unpacked event on September 4, which could point to some other products the company will show off at IFA 2025. All signs point to the next Unpacked being about tablets and midrange phones. Samsung is rumored to be announcing both the Galaxy Tab S11 and S11 Ultra, which will carry over the general look and feel of the company's past tablets with a few important tweaks, according to WinFuture. Besides battery improvements and Android 16, the biggest change Samsung is reportedly making is using a MediaTek Dimensity 9400 chip in the tablets rather than its own Exynos models or something from Qualcomm. The Snapdragon 8 Elite is considered the top of the line, so opting for MediaTek could raise questions about performance, but we'll have to use the tablets to know for sure.\nSamsung is also rumored to be announcing the Galaxy S25 FE at the event. It becomes less clear by the year what \"FE\" or \"Fan Edition\" means, but the Galaxy S25 FE is expected to have some meaningful improvements over the Galaxy S24 FE. Alongside a Samsung-designed Exynos chip, the S25 FE is rumored to feature an improved 12MP selfie camera and a 4,900mAh battery with 45W charging, according to SamMobile.\nAcer\nSam Rutherford for Engadget\nLike Samsung, Acer is hosting its own press conference at IFA 2025. The company's description of the event is frustratingly vague, but does suggest announcements focused on both productivity and gaming. At IFA 2024, Acer introduced multiple Copilot+PCs, including updates to the company's Swift and Aspire lines with the latest Intel Core Ultra chips and Windows AI features. Updates to both lineups seem highly likely at IFA 2025. Don't be surprised if Acer shows off some more concept devices, too. The company's Acer Project DualPlay, a laptop with a detachable game controller, was a big hit at last year's show, and something the company is bound to top.\nWhen it comes to handheld gaming PCs, Acer's detailed its plans to sell three different sizes of handheld, the Acer Nitro Blaze 11, Blaze 8 and Blaze 7, but yet to release them all globally. It might make sense to use IFA 2025 to finalize that and tease whatever it's working on next.\nLenovo\nSam Rutherford for Engadget\nWhen it comes to Lenovo, the company has a tried and true playbook for events like IFA. It demoes a slew of new laptops, updates its non-foldable Motorola phones and introduces one or two absolutely bizarre concept devices. The pattern seems like it'll repeat for IFA 2025.\nIf the stars of last year's show were a 16-inch Legion gaming laptop and an \"Auto Twist\" concept that swivels with a voice command, this year Lenovo's looking at a different kind of rotation. Leaker Evan Blass shared images at what looks like a new concept laptop with a display that can be rotated into portrait orientation. Blass also shared images of three new Moto phones, and two new Lenovo tablets.\nLenovo has a habit of showing off concept devices at trade shows, some of which are precursors to shipping products -- a la the ThinkBook Plus Gen 6 w/ rollable display -- while others will never see the light of day. At next week's IFA/Innovation Week, that concept will be a… pic.twitter.com/PMIJdowgHG— Evan Blass (@evleaks) August 28, 2025\n\nLenovo has a new handheld PC of its own to announce, too. The company released the Lenovo Legion Go S earlier this year, and now it's reportedly ready to announce the Lenovo Legion Go 2. The new handheld is rumored to feature a new AMD Ryzen Z2 Extreme chip, the same detachable, Switch-style controllers and more RAM. If Lenovo announces the handheld, it'll likely be the most powerful handheld gaming PC available for purchase, with a price tag to match.\n...but most eyes will probably be on the second-generation Legion Go (whose doppelganger, the Steam-powered Legion Go S, was revealed earlier this year at MWC). pic.twitter.com/G03WzvODBj— Evan Blass (@evleaks) August 29, 2025\n\nHisense\nHisense\nAccording to the event description for Hisense's IFA 2025 press conference, the company plans to \"further upgrade its RGB-MiniLED TV with powerful hardware improvements and AI-driven software.\" Hisense introduced the 116-inch UX RGB-MiniLED TV back in July, what the company claims is the first mass-produced television with dedicated red, green and blue LEDs. The approach lets the TV reach a peak brightness of 8,000 nits, among other benefits.\nDetailing how much the TV will cost, and what kind of features its \"Hi-View AI Engine X\" chip will power makes sense. Don't be surprised if Hisense also takes time to talk about the even bigger 136-inch MX MicroLED TV it announced at CES 2025, too.\nAnker\nValentina Palladino for Engadget\nWith Google fully embracing Qi2 charging on its Pixel 10 phones, there's never been a better time for Anker to announce new Qi2 chargers. Given that the company's IFA press conference is supposed to feature \"major product launches that bring intelligence into everyday life,\" it seems like AI features are a safe bet. That likely means Anker's Eufy or Soundcore brands could be the real focus. Maybe the company has new AI improvements for its Eufy robot vacuums, or audio improvements for its Soundcore headphones? We'll have to wait for IFA to start to find out.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/ifa-2025-what-to-expect-from-samsung-acer-lenovo-and-more-181825489.html?src=rss",

    "full_text": "WhatsApp said on Friday that it fixed a security bug in its iOS and Mac apps that was being used to stealthily hack into the Apple devices of “specific targeted users.” The Meta-owned messaging app giant said in its security advisory that it fixed the vulnerability, known officially as CVE-2025-55177, which was used alongside a separate flaw found in iOS and Macs, which Apple fixed last week and tracks as CVE-2025-43300. Apple said at the time that the flaw was used in an “extremely sophisticated attack against specific targeted individuals.” Now we know that dozens of WhatsApp users were targeted with this pair of flaws. Donncha Ó Cearbhaill, who heads Amnesty International’s Security Lab, described the attack in a post on X as an “advanced spyware campaign” that targeted users over the past 90 days, or since the end of May. The two bugs chained together allow an attacker to deliver a malicious exploit through WhatsApp that’s capable of stealing data from the user’s Apple device. This is not the first time that WhatsApp users have been targeted by government spyware, a kind of malware capable of breaking into fully patched devices with vulnerabilities not known to the vendor, known as zero-day flaws. In May, a U.S. court ordered spyware maker NSO Group to pay WhatsApp $167 million in damages for a 2019 hacking campaign that broke into the devices of more than 1,400 WhatsApp users with an exploit capable of planting NSO’s Pegasus spyware. WhatsApp brought the legal case against NSO, citing a breach of federal and state hacking laws, as well as its own terms of service. Did you receive a notification that your device was compromised?

    "summary": "In just over a week, the Apple iPhone 17 event will be here — it's Tuesday, September 9 — and we'll finally get to see the new iPhone 17 lineup. Assuming Apple sticks to tradition, we should be able to install iOS 26 roughly one week after the event. But you don't have to wait to test out the new features because you can download and install the newly released public beta 5 (or iOS 26 developer beta 8 for developers). I've been playing around with it for the past couple of weeks, and have found that taking screenshots is way better in the new operating system, as well as getting to choose how long you snooze. Even the refreshed Camera app is easier to navigate. You can see a more complete view of the new features in our preview of the iOS 26 public beta release, which shows off the fresh home and lock screen redesign. Called Liquid Glass, the translucent look will extend across all of Apple's upcoming operating systems. The overhaul is one of several big changes coming to iOS, macOS, iPadOS and the rest of Apple's software suite, all of which were showcased during the company's WWDC keynote on June 9.\nAfter overpromising on AI plans last year, Apple kept its iOS roadmap focused more on basic quality of life improvements this year. There are multiple useful additions coming to the Phone and Messages apps on your iPhone, for instance: Apple execs outlined the ability to weed out spam texts or other unknown senders and an option to hold your spot on a phone call when you've been waiting for a representative to pick up. Plus, a treasured feature that we took for granted is coming back (hint: it's in the Photos app).\nWith each beta, it seems like additional new improvements are popping up, like this new AirPods gesture we're all curious about, and this FaceTime feature that'll freeze your video if it detects nudity. With the release of the iOS 26 developer beta 5, we saw more added features, like a new bouncy animation on the passcode screen and in the Control Center, MacRumors reports. Some or all of those changes will likely soon migrate into the separate public beta (see below). Most newer iPhone models are eligible to download iOS 26 (both the betas and final version). Want to see the full list of new features coming this fall? Read on. \nWhat is iOS 26?\nThe current iPhone operating system is iOS 18, and Apple is still actively updating it — version 18.6.1 was released to restore Apple Watch blood oxygen monitoring functionality for certain users in the US. More recently, Apple released 18.6.2 to address a vulnerability related to image processing. Apple has officially stopped signing iOS 18.6, MacRumors reports, which means it can no longer be installed on your iPhone due to a \"server-side software verification check.\" That's pretty normal when newer versions are available to download.\nBut don't expect to see iOS 19 soon — or ever. Instead, Apple is skipping the numbering ahead to iOS 26 next month. The company has decided to line up its iOS version numbers with a year-based system, similar to car model years. So while iOS and its sibling operating systems will be released in late 2025, they're all designated \"26\" to reflect the year ahead. \nIt's official, we're moving to iOS 26. (Apple)\nWhat is Liquid Glass design?\nLet's be honest. Out of everything announced at WWDC this year, the new Liquid Glass design was the star of the show. The iPhone's home and lock screens have looked pretty much the same year after year — the last exciting thing (in my opinion) was the option to add your own aesthetic to your home screen by customizing your apps and widgets. So seeing the home and lock screens' new facelift is refreshing.\nSo what exactly is Liquid Glass? Apple calls it a \"new translucent material\" since, well, the apps and widgets are clear. However, the screen can still adapt to dark and light modes, depending on surroundings. You'll also notice buttons with a new floating design in several apps, like Phone and Maps. They're designed to be less distracting than the current buttons, but are still easy to see. While the design overhaul has proven to be controversial since its announcement, some — including Engadget's own Devindra Hardawar — like the new direction, even if it's somewhat reminiscent of Microsoft's translucent Windows Vista Aero designs from nearly twenty years ago.\nThat said, as of the release of the iOS 26 beta 2, Apple has already incorporated some user feedback into the design, dialing back the transparency in at least some places. And while it will continue to evolve, Apple users won't be able to escape it: Liquid Glass was designed to make all of Apple's OSes more cohesive. Here's a look at how the translucent aesthetic will look with the new macOS Tahoe 26 on your desktop.\nWhat are the new and notable features of iOS 26?\niOS 26 has a laundry list of new features. Among the most worthwhile:\nPhone app redesign: You'll finally be able to scroll through contacts, recent calls and voicemail messages all on one screen. It also comes with a new feature called Hold Assist that'll notify you when an agent comes to the phone so you can avoid the elevator music and continue on with other tasks.\nLive Translation in Phone, FaceTime and Messages: iOS 26 is bringing the ability to have a conversation via phone call or text message with someone who speaks another language. Live Translation will translate your conversation in real time, which results in some stop-and-go interactions in the examples Apple shared during its presentation.\nPolls in group chats: Tired of sorting through what seems like hundreds of messages in your group chat? You and your friends will soon be able to create polls in group messages for deciding things like which brunch spot you're eating at or whose car you're taking on a road trip.\nFiltering unknown senders in Messages: If you haven't received spam texts about unpaid tolls or other citations, you're lucky. For those of us who have, those annoying messages will soon be filtered away in a separate folder.\nVisual Intelligence: Similar to a reverse Google image search, this new feature will allow you to search for anything that's on your iPhone screen. For instance, if you spot a pair of shoes someone is wearing in an Instagram photo, you can screenshot it and use Visual Intelligence to find those shoes (or similar ones) online.\nPhotos tabs are back: For anyone who's still frustrated with the Photos changes made last year, you'll be happy to know that your tabs are coming back. Library and Collections will have their own separate spaces so you don't have to scroll to infinity to find what you're looking for.\nFaceTime \"Communication Safety\" feature: A newer addition to iOS 26 appears to be the FaceTime \"Communication Safety\" feature that pauses communications if and when nudity is detected. The feature appears to be a child safety feature that uses on-device detection, thus obviating any cloud-based privacy issues. \nNew lock screen options: The iPhone lock screen gets more customizable in iOS 26, with a cooler clock, 3D wallpaper effects, more widgets and better focus mode options. \nApple's Hold Assist will be nifty for those pesky services that put you on hold for 10 or more minutes. (Apple)\nNew changes coming to iPadOS 26\nYour iPad isn't getting left behind when it comes to big updates. Here's what's coming this fall.\nMultitasking and real windowing: When you download the newest update, you'll be able to have multiple apps running on your screen at the same time. Once you open an app, it'll appear on your screen as normal but you'll be able to resize and move it across your screen to make room for other apps. This feature is optional so you can turn it off if you don't like it.\nVisual update: Along with the other new OSes, iPadOS 26 is coming with the Liquid Glass aesthetic. This new look will appear on the lock and home screens, as well as the drop-down menus.\nNew menu bar: When you swipe down on your screen, the new menu bar will appear with options like File, Edit, Windows and more. There's also a search option if you're looking for something specific.\nCheck out our first impressions of iPadOS 26. \nWhat about AirPods?\nAirPods are also getting updated with iOS 26. Here are some of the more notable functions.\nEnhanced audio recording: Apple calls this \"studio-quality\" audio recording, and with it, you'll notice more clarity while in noisy environments.\nCamera remote control: Using this, you can take a photo or start and stop video recording with just one press on your AirPods. When taking photos, you'll get a three-second countdown before your iPhone or iPad snaps the picture.\nLive translation feature: While not officially announced or confirmed, it appears that the long-rumored live translation for AirPods could be coming with iOS 26. The evidence comes from a system asset spotted in the in iOS 26 beta showing a gesture that's triggered by pressing both earbud stems at the same time. The photo also shows words in several different languages. \nHeart rate monitoring (rumored for now): Bloomberg's Mark Gurman believes Apple will introduce new AirPods Pro earbuds this year, which could have heart rate monitoring. It would work with Apple's Health app and other fitness apps that track heart rates.\nWill Siri get an update?\nSiri is in a holding pattern. Apple has previously specified that its smarter voice assistant — first promised at WWDC 2024 — is delayed until some point \"in the coming year,\" so you shouldn't expect any major changes in the current betas. But there are reports that Apple is aiming to give Siri a bigger brain transplant by basing it on third-party artificial intelligence models like OpenAI's ChatGPT or Anthropic's Claude, which could make 2026 a pivotal year. The company is also reportedly working on a \"stripped-down\" AI chatbot to rival ChatGPT.\nWhich iPhones will be able to upgrade to iOS 26?\nA few iPhone models that run the current version of iOS — iPhone XR, XS and XS Max — won't be compatible with the latest upgrade. But any iPhones released in 2019 or later will be eligible for the iOS 26 update.\n\niPhone SE (second generation or later)\niPhone 11\niPhone 11 Pro\niPhone 11 Pro Max\niPhone 12\niPhone 12 mini\niPhone 12 Pro\niPhone 12 Pro Max\niPhone 13\niPhone 13 mini\niPhone 13 Pro\niPhone 13 Pro Max\niPhone 14\niPhone 14 Plus\niPhone 14 Pro\niPhone 14 Pro Max\niPhone 15\niPhone 15 Plus\niPhone 15 Pro\niPhone 15 Pro Max\niPhone 16\niPhone 16 Plus\niPhone 16 Pro\niPhone 16 Pro Max\niPhone 16e\n\nNot listed here are the presumed new iPhone 17 models (or maybe iPhone 26?) that are all but certain to be announced and released in September. \nHow to install iOS 26 beta\nThe iOS 26 public beta is now available to download via the Apple Beta Software Program. If you're not already a member, you'll need to sign up to try out all the latest features. Just visit beta.apple.com and sign up with your phone number or email address. It's free.\nOnce you're in, you can install it by going to Settings > General > Software Update and selecting iOS 26 public beta. \nA word of caution: Don't sign up with your main iPhone unless you're OK with any risks that occur with using an OS that isn't finalized.\nWhen will the final version of iOS 26 be released?\niOS 26 will be released to the public this fall. It usually comes in September, within a week of the Apple iPhone event. Last year, it rolled out to iPhone users on September 16 — exactly one week after the iPhone 16 lineup was announced. Since the iPhone 17 event falls on September 9 this year, it's possible the downloads will hit our phones on September 16.\nIf you're more interested in the Apple Intelligence features coming, here's everything Apple revealed for iOS, macOS and more during WWDC. Also, check out how iOS 26 screenshots could be an intriguing preview of Apple's delayed Siri rework.\nUpdate, August 29: Added new section about Siri and a link to what's new with the iOS 26 Camera app.\nUpdate, August 27: Added the official iPhone 17 event date, as well as the potential iOS 26 release.\nUpdate, August 25: Added a rumor about new AirPods Pro having heart rate monitoring.\nUpdate, August 22: Noted that Apple has officially stopped signing iOS 18.6.\nUpdate, August 20: Noted that iOS 26 public beta 4 and iOS 18.6.2 are now available to download.\nUpdate, August 18: Added details about a potential iOS 18.6 update.\nUpdate, August 15: Added to link to what to expect at the Apple iPhone event and details about what's available in the iOS 26 screenshots editor.\nUpdate, August 13: Added new AirPods detail spotted in the iOS 26 beta.\nUpdate, August 11: Noted that iOS 26 developer beta has hit beta 6. \nUpdate, August 8: Added new features coming with iPadOS 26 and AirPods.\nUpdate, August 6: Noted the release of iOS 26 beta 5 and the new bouncy feature on passcode screen and Control Center.\nUpdate, August 4: Noted that Apple is reportedly working on a ChatGPT rival.\nUpdate, August 1: Added quote from Tim Cook about iOS 26.\nUpdate, July 31: Noted that iOS 18.6 is now available. \nUpdate, July 24: Noted the iOS 26 public beta is now available.\nUpdate, July 3: Noted new FaceTime feature found in the developer beta.\nUpdate, June 30: Noted ongoing iOS 18 releases, and reports that Apple is considering additional external LLMs for Siri. \nUpdate, June 25: Noted changes added in iOS 26 beta 2. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/apple-ios-26-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-new-features-in-the-upcoming-iphone-update-135749557.html?src=rss",
    "full_text": "Called Liquid Glass, the translucent look will extend across all of Apple's upcoming operating systems. Plus, a treasured feature that we took for granted is coming back (hint: it's in the Photos app). Some or all of those changes will likely soon migrate into the separate public beta (see below). Most newer iPhone models are eligible to download iOS 26 (both the betas and final version). So while iOS and its sibling operating systems will be released in late 2025, they're all designated \"26\" to reflect the year ahead. You'll also notice buttons with a new floating design in several apps, like Phone and Maps. Phone app redesign: You'll finally be able to scroll through contacts, recent calls and voicemail messages all on one screen. Camera remote control: Using this, you can take a photo or start and stop video recording with just one press on your AirPods. When taking photos, you'll get a three-second countdown before your iPhone or iPad snaps the picture.

    "full_text": "Decentralized social network Mastodon says it can’t comply with Mississippi’s age verification law — the same law that saw rival Bluesky pull out of the state — because it doesn’t have the means to do so. The social nonprofit explains that Mastodon doesn’t track its users, which makes it difficult to enforce such legislation. “And this is why real decentralization matters,” said Rochko. Masnick pushed back, questioning why Mastodon’s individual servers, like the one Rochko runs at mastodon.social, would not also be subject to the same $10,000 per user fines for noncompliance with the law. On Friday, however, the nonprofit shared a statement with TechCrunch to clarify its position, saying that while Mastodon’s own servers specify a minimum age of 16 to sign up for its services, it does not “have the means to apply age verification” to its services. That is, the Mastodon software doesn’t support it. The Mastodon 4.4 release in July 2025 added the ability to specify a minimum age for sign-up and other legal features for handling terms of service, partly in response to increased regulation around these areas. That means individual server owners have to decide for themselves if they believe an age verification component is a necessary addition. The nonprofit says Mastodon is currently unable to provide “direct or operational assistance” to the broader set of Mastodon server operators. Mastodon notes that it’s “not tracking, or able to comment on, the policies and operations of individual servers that run Mastodon.”"

OpenAI wants to incorporate Anthropic’s Model Context Protocol (MCP) into all of its products, including the ChatGPT desktop app. Reliance has proposed selling OpenAI’s models to businesses in India through an application programming interface (API) so they can incorporate AI into their operations. we trained a new model that is good at creative writing (not sure yet how/when it will get released).

Its closure highlights the persistent challenges social media startups face in building user bases and achieving long-term growth. The Seattle-based research and engineering startup recently launched EigenCloud, a platform that provides blockchain-level trust guarantees for any Web 2.0 or web3 application. The startup said it intends to keep on recruiting employees who fit in with its long-term expansion plans. The move comes ahead of Intel’s Q1 earnings call helmed by recently appointed CEO Lip-Bu Tan, who took over from longtime chief Pat Gelsinger last year. The company is also making reductions in its facilities, though it does not plan to close any offices. Will cut roughly 5% of its current workforce in a new efficiency drive to increase profitability and growth. Laid off more employees in a new effort to cut costs, though the total number is unknown. Cut 51 jobs in its San Francisco headquarters, according to state filings with the Employment Development Department."

He had just received his monthly stipend as a master’s student in Stuttgart and wanted to send part of it back to his family in Cairo. It was usually a slow and expensive process, he recalled. “It’s a problem I have personally experienced and one that resonates with a lot of people who want to send money back home quickly and efficiently.” A scholarship took him to Europe, where he completed two master’s degrees in Germany and Switzerland. Leaving Huspy gave him space to reflect on his own immigrant journey. Egypt is one of the world’s largest remittance markets, receiving nearly $30 billion in inflows annually. “We’ve really tailored this experience for people from the region,” said Ashmawy. YC has historically invested in startups solving hard financial infrastructure problems, from Stripe to Coinbase. Similarly, remittances are one of the most entrenched pain points in global finance and one of the accelerator’s consistent focus areas when backing startups from emerging markets (case in point: LemFi and Aspora) before its recent AI tilt."

    "summary": "Google has started rolling out customizable calling cards for the beta versions of its Android Contacts and Phone apps. Android Authority found clues that the company was working on the feature back in July when it did an APK teardown. Now, you can give it a try if you decide to install the beta versions of the apps. As the publication notes, Google's implementation is the direct opposite of Apple's. On iOS, your set your own photo and name that you want to show up on other people's phones when you call them. You cannot alter other people's Contact Posters, as Apple calls the feature. Meanwhile, on Android, you can't make your own calling card. The feature instead gives you a way to set a photo and a name for your contacts that show up on your screen when they call you. \nIf you do have access to the beta Contacts app for Android, you'll now see a note that says \"Try adding a calling card\" when you view a contact's details. From there, you can choose a photo you have of that contact from your gallery or take a new one of them with your camera. You can also adjust the font type and color for their name. Whenever they call, that calling card will take over your phone screen. If this sounds nothing new to you, it may be because Samsung has had a profile card feature for a while now that works just like Google's implementation. It's already widely available and accessible from your contacts' profile pages. \nUpdate, August 29 2025, 10:11AM ET: Google has announced that its Calling Cards feature is now rolling out to Android users worldwide. Once you’ve updated your Google Phone app to version v188, you’ll be able to set a full-screen picture that appears for all outgoing and incoming calls. Google says the feature will be made available in phases, so you might not get it straight away.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/google-is-testing-customizable-calling-cards-for-android-that-show-up-when-your-friends-call-123038875.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "It's no secret that Apple devices tend to be in particularly high demand. Unfortunately, that demand can make finding big discounts on Apple gadgets a bit harder than usual. But make no mistake: Good Apple deals are usually out there. To make them a bit easier to find, we're keeping a running list of the best Apple deals on AirPods, MacBooks, iPads and more that you can shop right now. \nJust note that you’ll almost always find the best Apple deals from retailers like Amazon, Best Buy, Walmart, Target and the like, not from Apple's own online store. Unless you shop refurbished, you’ll always pay top dollar buying direct (though for some items like iPhones, that might be the best route to take). \nBest iPad deals\n \nApple iPad Air 13-inch (M3) for $649 ($150 off): Engadget's Nate Ingraham gave the 13-inch iPad Air a score of 89 when it was released in March. It has a bigger and slightly brighter display than its 11-inch counterpart; otherwise, the two slates are the same. If you plan to keep your iPad hooked up to a keyboard, the extra screen space is lovely for taking in movies and multitasking for work. This is another new low, and it applies to various color options and storage configs.\nApple iPad mini (A17 Pro) for $399 ($100 off): The iPad mini is exactly what it sounds like: the smaller iPad. This latest iteration has an improved A17 Pro chip — which is enough to support Apple Intelligence — along with 128GB of storage in the base model and Apple Pencil Pro support. As before, you’d buy it if you value the smaller 8.3-inch display and want a tablet you can more easily hold with one hand. This deal is $20 more than the lowest price we've tracked. Also at Target and Best Buy.\nApple iPad Pro 11-inch (M4) for $895 ($105 off): The iPad Pro is much more tablet than most people need, but it’s the ultimate iPad for those who can stomach its price tag. It’s wonderfully thin, its OLED display is one of the best we’ve seen on a consumer device and its M4 chip can handle virtually anything you’d ever do on an iPad. It’s also the only Apple tablet with Face ID, plus it has a better speaker setup than the iPad Air. We gave it a score of 84 in our review, with the only real drawback being its price. Also at BJ's for $45 less, if you have a membership there.\nApple iPad Pro 13-inch (M4) for $1,099 ($200 off): The 13-inch iPad Pro has all the same specs as the 11-inch model, only it's bigger and more expensive. Again, it may be worth the extra cost if you plan to multitask regularly or just want more display area for enjoying movies. Also at Target and Best Buy.\nBest AirPods deals\n \nBest Mac deals\n \nApple MacBook Air (15-inch, M4) for $999 ($200 off): The 15-inch MacBook Air is nearly identical to the smaller version but features more robust speakers and a more spacious trackpad alongside its roomier display. $999 is the lowest price we've tracked.\nApple MacBook Pro (14-inch, M4 Pro) for $1,699 ($300 off): The MacBook Pro goes beyond most people’s needs, but it remains a powerhouse for coders, media editors or anyone else with especially demanding workloads. We gave it a score of 92 last November. Just keep in mind that it’s heavier than the MacBook Air and that it still lacks a standard USB-A port. Also at Best Buy.\nApple iMac (24-inch, M4) for $1,149 ($150 off): For an all-in-one solution, the M4 iMac is a good pick thanks to its powerful performance, standard 16GB of RAM and improved webcam. Just note that it only comes in the 24-inch screen size option. We've seen this deal in the past, and it’s not quite an all-time low, but it's a decent savings compared to buying from Apple directly.\nBest Apple Watch deals\n \nApple Watch SE (GPS, 40mm) for $169 ($80 off): As with the more premium models, we wouldn’t be surprised to see an update to Apple’s budget smartwatch sometime soon (and we have a few suggestions on the matter). But thanks to discounts like this, the Apple Watch SE has turned out to be the most affordable way to get an iPhone companion for your wrist. Despite a lackluster screen and limited extra features, it handles the basics well. Also at Walmart.\nBest Apple accessories deals\n \nApple Pencil Pro for $99 ($30 off): The highest-end option in Apple’s confusing stylus lineup, the Pencil Pro supports pressure sensitivity, wireless charging, tilt detection, haptic feedback and support for Apple’s double tap and squeeze gestures, among other perks. It’s a lovely tool for more intricate sketching and note-taking, but the catch is that it’s only compatible with the M4 iPad Pro, M2 and M3 iPad Air and most recent iPad mini. We've seen this deal fairly often over the course of the year, but it's a decent discount compared to buying from Apple directly. Also at Walmart, Best Buy and Target.\nApple Pencil (USB-C) for $69 ($10 off): This more affordable Apple Pencil doesn’t support pressure sensitivity, but it still makes for a useful stylus for the basics. If you’re a casual note-taker and can live without wireless charging, you’ll save a few bucks by picking this one up. Also at Walmart, Best Buy and Target.\nRead more Apple coverage:\n\nThe best AirPods\nThe best Apple Watches\nThe best MacBooks\nThe best iPhones\nThe best iPads\n\nFollow @EngadgetDeals on X for the latest tech deals and buying advice.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/best-apple-deals-150020110.html?src=rss",

It still tracks workouts accurately and delivers alerts to your wrist efficiently, though we will almost certainly see a new Series 11 model by the end of the year if you're not in any rush.

The overall shape of earbuds can determine whether you get a comfortable fit, so can the size and weight, so you’ll want to consider all that before deciding. And remember: audio companies aren’t perfect, so despite lots of research, the earbud shape they decided on may not fit you well. Don’t be afraid to return ill-fitting earbuds for something that’s more comfortable. \nAs wireless earbuds have become the norm, they’re now more reliable for basic things like consistent Bluetooth connectivity. Companies are still in a race to pack as much as they can into increasingly smaller designs. This typically means a longer list of features on the more premium sets of earbuds with basic functionality on the cheapest models. Carefully consider what you can’t live without when selecting your next earbuds, and make sure key items like automatic pausing and multipoint connectivity are on the spec sheet. You’ll also want to investigate the volume and touch controls as you’ll often have to sacrifice access to something else to make that adjustment via on-board taps or swipes. Some earbuds even offer app settings to tweak the audio profiles or firmware updates to improve performance over time.\nFor those in the Apple ecosystem, features like auto-pairing with devices, especially with AirPods Pro 2, can be an added advantage, while Android users may want to look for models that offer similar cross-device functionality.\nWhen it comes to battery life, the average set of earbuds lasts about five hours on a single charge. You can find sets that last longer, but this is likely enough to get you through a work day if you’re docking the buds during lunch or the occasional meeting. You’ll want to check on how many extra charges are available via the case and if it supports wireless charging.\nCompanies will also make lofty claims about call quality on wireless earbuds. Despite lots of promises, the reality is most earbuds still leave you sounding like you’re on speakerphone. There are some sets that deliver, but don’t get your hopes up unless reviews confirm the claims.\nSound can be subjective, so we recommend trying before you buy if at all possible. This is especially true if you're an audiophile. We understand this isn’t easy when most of us do a lot of shopping online, but trying on a set of earbuds and listening to them for a few minutes can save you from an expensive case of buyer's remorse. If a store doesn’t allow a quick demo, most retailers have return policies that will let you take earbuds back you don’t like. Of course, you have to be willing to temporarily part with funds in order to do this.\nWe also recommend paying attention to things like Spatial Audio, Dolby Atmos, 360 Reality Audio and other immersive formats. Not all earbuds support them, so you’ll want to make sure a perspective pair does if that sort of thing excites you, especially if you plan to use them for playback of high-quality audio.\nHow we test wireless earbuds\nThe primary way we test earbuds is to wear them as much as possible. We prefer to do this over a one- to two-week period, but sometimes embargoes don’t allow it. During this time, we listen to a mix of music and podcasts, while also using the earbuds to take both voice and video calls. Since battery life for earbuds is typically less than a full day, we drain the battery with looping music and the volume set at a comfortable level (usually around 75 percent).\nTo judge audio quality, we listen to a range of genres, noting any differences in the sound profile across the styles. We also test at both low and high volumes to check for consistency in the tuning. To assess call quality, we’ll record audio samples with the earbuds’ microphones as well as have third parties call us.\nWhen it comes to features, we do a thorough review of companion apps, testing each feature as we work through the software. Any holdovers from previous models are double checked for improvements or regression. If the earbuds we’re testing are an updated version of a previous model, we’ll spend time getting reacquainted with the older buds. Ditto for the closest competition for each new set of earbuds that we review.\nOther wireless Bluetooth earbuds we tested\nSony WF-C710N\nThe WF-C710N is a set of compact and comfy earbuds that offer several of Sony’s best features. While the ANC performance is above average for this price ($120), sound quality isn’t as good as the company’s slightly more expensive options. Battery life fell below stated figures and call performance isn’t good enough to use these buds for work.\nBeats Powerbeats Pro 2\nThe newest version of the Powerbeats Pro have an improved, comfortable design, balanced bass and new H2 chips and a heart rate sensor inside. But heart rate support is currently limited on iOS, and there's a possibility those capabilities make it onto the next AirPods Pro models.\nSamsung Galaxy Buds 3\nThe Galaxy Buds 3 combine ANC with an open-type design, which renders the noise-blocking abilities of the earbuds mostly useless. Still, there’s great low-end tone with ample bass when a track demands it. There are also lots of handy features, most of which require a Samsung phone. But at this price, there are better options from Google, Beats and Sony\nSennheiser Momentum Sport\nI really like the overall shape of the Momentum Sport earbuds. They’re more comfortable than the Momentum True Wireless 4 and fit in my ears better. What’s more, the body temperature and heart rate sensors work well, sending those stats to a variety of apps. However, that sport-tracking feature works best with Polar’s app and devices, so there’s that consideration. Also, the audio quality and ANC performance isn’t as good as the MTW4, and these earbuds are pricey.\nBeats Solo Buds\nThere’s a lot to like about the Solo Buds for $80. For me, the primary perk is they’re very comfortable to wear for long periods of time thanks to some thoughtful design considerations. You only get the basics here in terms of features and, as expected, the overall sound quality isn’t as good as the pricier models in the Beats lineup. You will get 18 hours of battery life though, since the company nixed the battery in the case and beefed up the listening time in the buds themselves.\nBose Ultra Open Earbuds\nBose created something very unique for this set of earbuds that allows you to stay in-tune with the world while listening to audio content. The clip-on design is very comfortable, but sound quality suffers due to the open-type fit, especially when it comes to bass and spatial audio.\nAudio-Technica ATH-TWX7\nThese stick buds have a compact design that’s comfortable to wear and the warm sound profile is great at times. However, overall audio performance is inconsistent and there’s no automatic pausing.\nMaster & Dynamic MW09\nRetooled audio, better ambient sound mode and reliable multipoint Bluetooth are the best things the MW09 has to offer. They’re expensive though, and you can find better ANC performance elsewhere.\nWireless earbud FAQs\nWhat is considered good battery life for true wireless earbuds?\nMost wireless earbuds will last five hours on a single charge, at the least. You can find some pairs that have even better battery life, lasting between six and eight hours before they need more juice. All of the best wireless earbuds come with a charging case, which will provide additional hours of battery life — but you'll have to return each bud to the case in order to charge them up.\nIs sound quality better on headphones or earbuds?\nComparing sound quality on earbuds and headphones is a bit like comparing apples and oranges. There are a lot of variables to consider and the differences in components make a direct comparison difficult. Personally, I prefer the audio quality from over-ear headphones, but I can tell you the sound from earbuds like Sennheiser’s Momentum True Wireless 3 is also outstanding.\nWhich wireless earbuds have the longest battery life?\nWith new models coming out all the time, tracking the hours of battery life for each this can be difficult to keep tabs on. The longest-lasting earbuds we’ve reviewed are Audio-Technica’s ATH-CKS5TW. The company states they last 15 hours, but the app was still showing 40 percent at that mark during our tests. The only downside is these earbuds debuted in 2019 and both technology and features have improved since. In terms of current models, Master & Dynamic’s MW08 offers 12 hours of use on a charge with ANC off (10 with ANC on) and JBL has multiple options with 10-hour batteries.\nWhat wireless earbuds are waterproof?\nThere are plenty of options these days when it comes to increased water resistance. To determine the level of protection, you’ll want to look for an IP (ingress protection) rating. The first number indicates intrusion protection from things like dust. The second number is the level of moisture protection and you’ll want to make sure that figure is 7 or higher. At this water-resistance rating, earbuds can withstand full immersion for up to 30 minutes in depths up to one meter (3.28 feet). If either of the IP numbers is an X, that means it doesn’t have any special protection. For example, a pair of wireless earbuds that are IPX7 wouldn’t be built to avoid dust intrusion, but they would be ok if you dropped them in shallow water.\nWhich earbuds stay in ears the best?\nA secure fit can vary wildly from person to person. All of our ears are different, so audio companies are designing their products to fit the most people they can with a single shape. This is why AirPods will easily fall out for some but stay put for others. Design touches like wing tips or fins typically come on fitness models and those elements can help keep things in place. You’ll likely just have to try earbuds on, and if they don’t fit well return them.\nWhat wireless earbuds work with PS5?\nPlayStation 5 doesn’t support Bluetooth audio without an adapter or dongle. Even Sony’s own gaming headsets come with a transmitter that connects to the console. There are universal options that allow you to use any headphones, headset or earbuds with a PS5. Once you have one, plug it into a USB port on the console and pair your earbuds with it.\nRecent updates\nMay 2025: Updated to ensure top picks and buying advice remain accurate.\nMarch 2025: Updated the top pick for the best sounding wireless earbuds - runner up.\nJanuary 2025: Updated the top pick for best sounding wireless earbuds.\nJuly 2024: Updated our list to include the Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/best-wireless-earbuds-120058222.html?src=rss",
    "full_text": "Sony still manages to pack in more features than anyone else too, including trademark ones like adaptive sound and Speak-to-Chat. You’ll also enjoy well over eight hours of battery life with ANC on and an IPX4 rating that will be good enough for workouts. What’s more, handy Speak-to-Chat is here and Adaptive Sound Control can automatically change settings based on activity or location. As wireless earbuds have become the norm, they’re now more reliable for basic things like consistent Bluetooth connectivity. You’ll want to check on how many extra charges are available via the case and if it supports wireless charging.

    "summary": "A virtual private network (VPN) can save you a lot of money if you use it right. By changing your virtual location, you can use one streaming service to see shows that might be scattered between three or four in your home country. You can also trawl the world for discounts that only show up in a few select regions. And of course, you can't put a price on the joy of taking back your online business from intrusive ads and trackers.\nVPN providers are all competing to boost their subscriber counts, so they frequently offer massive discounts to anyone willing to sign up for one or two years at a time. Most of the deals below fit into that category. Before you jump into the list, make sure you're OK with a longer-term commitment. \nBest VPN deals\n \nNordVPN — $83.43 for a two-year subscription with three months free (77 percent off): NordVPN gets the most important parts of a VPN right. It's fast, it doesn't leak any of your data and it's great at changing your virtual location. I noted in my NordVPN review that it always connects quickly and includes a support page that makes it easy to get live help. Although I'm sad to see it shutting down Meshnet, NordVPN still includes a lot of cool features, like servers that instantly connect you to Tor. This deal gives you 77 percent off the two-year plan, which also comes with three extra months — but there's no expiration date, so you have a little time for comparison shopping.\nExpressVPN — $85.42 for a two-year subscription with four months free (61 percent off): This is one of the best VPNs, especially for new users, who will find its apps and website headache-free on all platforms. In tests for my ExpressVPN review, it dropped my download speeds by less than 7 percent and successfully changed my virtual location 14 out of 15 times. In short, it's an all-around excellent service that only suffers from being a little overpriced — which is why I'm so excited whenever I find it offering a decent deal. This deal, which gets you 28 months of ExpressVPN service, represents a 61 percent savings. It's the lowest I've seen ExpressVPN go in some time, though like NordVPN, it's not on a ticking clock.\nSurfshark Starter — $53.73 for a two-year subscription with three months free (87 percent off): This is the \"basic\" level of Surfshark, but it includes the entire VPN; everything on Surfshark One is an extra perk. With this subscription, you'll get some of the most envelope-pushing features in the VPN world right now. Surfshark has a more closely connected server network than most VPNs, so it can rotate your IP constantly to help you evade detection — it even lets you choose your own entry and exit nodes for a double-hop connection. That all comes with a near-invisible impact on download speeds. With this year-round deal, you can save 87 percent on 27 months of Surfshark.\nSurfshark One — $61.83 for a two-year subscription with three months free (87 percent off): A VPN is great, but it's not enough to protect your data all on its own. Surfshark One adds several apps that boost your security beyond just VPN service, including Surfshark Antivirus (scans devices and downloads for malware), Surfshark Alert (alerts you whenever your sensitive information shows up in a data breach) and Surfshark Search (a private search engine with no ads or activity tracking). This evergreen deal gives you 87 percent off all those features. If you bump up to Surfshark One+, you'll also get data removal through Incogni, but the price jumps enough that it's not quite worthwhile in my eyes.\nCyberGhost — $56.94 for a two-year subscription with two months free (83 percent off): CyberGhost has some of the best automation you'll see on any VPN. With its Smart Rules system, you can determine how its apps respond to different types of Wi-Fi networks, with exceptions for specific networks you know by name. Typically, you can set it to auto-connect, disconnect or send you a message asking what to do. CyberGhost's other best feature is its streaming servers — while it's not totally clear what it does to optimize them, I've found both better video quality and more consistent unblocking when I use them on streaming sites. Currently, you can get 26 months of CyberGhost for 83 percent off the usual price.\nPrivate Internet Access — $79 for a three-year subscription with three months free (83 percent off): It's a bit hard to find (the link at the start of this paragraph includes the coupon), but Private Internet Access (PIA) is giving out the best available price right now on a VPN I'd recommend using. With this deal, you can get 39 months of PIA for a little bit over $2 per month — an 83 percent discount on its monthly price. Despite being so cheap, PIA almost never comes off as a budget VPN, coming with its own DNS servers, a built-in ad blocker and automation powers to rival CyberGhost. However, internet speeds can fluctuate while you're connected.\nWhat makes a good VPN deal\nLike I said in the intro, practically every VPN heavily discounts its long-term subscriptions the whole year round. The only noteworthy exception is Mullvad, the Costco hot dog of VPNs (that's a compliment, to be clear). When there's constantly a huge discount going on, it can be hard to tell when you're actually getting a good deal. The best way to squeeze out more savings is to look for seasonal deals, student discounts or exclusive sales like Proton VPN's coupon for Engadget readers.\nOne trick VPNs often use is to add extra months onto an introductory deal, pushing the average monthly price even lower. When it comes time to renew, you usually can't get these extra months again. You often can't even renew for the same basic period of time — for example, you may only be able to renew a two-year subscription for one year. If you're planning to hold onto a VPN indefinitely, check the fine print to see how much it will cost per month after the first renewal, and ensure that fits into your budget.\nFollow @EngadgetDeals on X for the latest tech deals and buying advice.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/best-vpn-deals-120056041.html?src=rss",
    "full_text": "You can also trawl the world for discounts that only show up in a few select regions. For those who need a VPN to stay anonymous, Proton VPN is the only service implementing full-disk encryption, which means it can manage all your traffic without any of it being visible to Proton itself. ExpressVPN — $85.42 for a two-year subscription with four months free (61 percent off): This is one of the best VPNs, especially for new users, who will find its apps and website headache-free on all platforms. Surfshark has a more closely connected server network than most VPNs, so it can rotate your IP constantly to help you evade detection — it even lets you choose your own entry and exit nodes for a double-hop connection.

    "summary": "Windows offers several built-in ways to take screenshots. Sure, you can just hit the Prt Scrn button on your keyboard to capture your entire screen, but if you want to screenshot a portion of your screen, a particular window, or you have multiple monitors there are other ways you can use Windows to achieve this. Whether you're using Windows 11 or a recent update to Windows 10, the tools remain largely consistent and reliable. \nThis guide walks you through the most useful native screenshot methods, including the Snipping Tool, keyboard shortcuts and clipboard techniques, as well as popular third-party apps for more advanced needs. For more cross-platform tips, you can also check out Engadget's guide on how to take a screenshot on any device.\nHow to use the Snipping Tool for easy screenshots\nThe Snipping Tool is the most versatile built-in screenshot option in Windows. It lets you capture specific regions, open windows or the entire screen and includes basic annotation tools. It’s available by default on Windows 11 devices, though Windows 10 users can still access the Snipping Tool, despite it being replaced by Snip & Sketch.\n\nPress Windows + Shift + S to open the Snipping Tool overlay. The screen will dim slightly and a small toolbar will appear at the top.\nChoose one of the four capture modes:\n\n\nRectangular Snip: Click and drag to select a custom rectangle.\nFreeform Snip: Draw any shape around the area you want to capture.\nWindow Snip: Click on any open window to capture it.\nFull-screen Snip: Instantly captures the entire screen.\n\n\nOnce captured, the screenshot is copied to your clipboard and a preview appears in the bottom-right corner.\nClick the preview to open the image in the Snipping Tool app, where you can annotate, save or share it.\n\nTo open the full app manually, search for the Snipping Tool from the Start menu.\nHow to use Print Screen shortcuts for quick captures\nIf you want to take a screenshot without opening an app, the Print Screen (PrtScn) key and its combinations offer the fastest method.\nWindows + Print Screen\n\nPress Windows + PrtScn to capture the entire screen and automatically save the screenshot.\nThe image is stored as a PNG file in Pictures > Screenshots.\n\nPrint Screen (alone)\n\nPress PrtScn to copy the entire screen to the clipboard. Note: depending on your PC or laptop you may need to use a keyboard combination such as Windows Key + Prt Scn. See the section on other options below, like “How to take screenshots on Surface devices and laptops”.\nPaste it into an image editor like Paint or a document using Ctrl + V.\n\nAlt + Print Screen\n\nPress Alt + PrtScn to copy only the active window to the clipboard.\nThis is useful when working with multiple windows or monitors.\n\nHow to use the Game Bar for screenshots while gaming\nThe Xbox Game Bar is a built-in overlay that allows you to capture gameplay footage and screenshots. It works in most PC games and some desktop applications.\nHow to take a screenshot with the Game Bar\n\nPress Windows + G to open the Game Bar overlay. This works outside of games. You can use it on Windows (on your desktop) to control music, take screenshots and record screen captures, among other things.\nClick the camera icon in the Capture widget, or press Windows + Alt + PrtScn to take a full-screen screenshot instantly.\nScreenshots taken with Game Bar are saved in Videos > Captures.\n\nIf the Game Bar doesn't appear, you may need to enable it by going to Settings > Gaming > Xbox Game Bar.\nSave directly to the clipboard or paste into apps\nIf you don't want to save a file immediately, copying a screenshot to the clipboard lets you paste it directly into chat apps, email clients or documents.\n\nWindows + Shift + S: Opens Snipping Tool and copies your selection to the clipboard.\nPrtScn or Alt + PrtScn: Copies either the full screen or active window.\nUse Ctrl + V to paste the image into Paint, Word, Outlook or other apps.\n\nHow to take screenshots on Surface devices and laptops\nOn some laptops and Surface tablets, the Print Screen function may be combined with other keys or replaced with dedicated shortcuts.\n\nFn + Prt Scn: Use this combo on laptops where PrtScn shares a key with other functions.\nWindows + Volume Down: On Surface devices, press these together to take a full-screen screenshot, similar to a phone or tablet.\n\nHow to use Windows Snip & Sketch (if available)\nWindows 10 users can use Snip & Sketch, the predecessor to the current Snipping Tool. It functions similarly but has a slightly different interface. On newer builds, Snip & Sketch has been merged into the modern Snipping Tool.\nHowever, it is possible for Windows 10 users to still use the original Snipping Tool by searching for “Snipping Tool” via the Start Menu, or by navigating to C:\\Windows\\System32\\SnippingTool.exe.\nTo launch it manually, search for Snip & Sketch in the Start menu, but just note that it's generally recommended to use the updated Snipping Tool for better compatibility.\nThird-party Windows screenshot tools\nFor more advanced workflows or custom capture needs, several third-party tools offer extended functionality, such as auto-saving, video capture and cloud syncing.\nShareX\nShareX is a free, open-source tool with deep customization options. It supports custom keyboard shortcuts, scheduled captures, auto-upload to cloud services, scrolling window screenshots and more. It’s best suited for power users or content creators.\nGreenshot\nGreenshot is a lightweight, beginner-friendly alternative that adds annotation tools and direct upload to services like Imgur. It’s ideal for users who want more features than the Snipping Tool without overwhelming complexity.\nSnagit (paid)\nSnagit offers advanced features like panoramic scrolling capture, video recording and image templates. It’s a premium tool with a one-time purchase cost, mainly used by professionals and educators.\nWhile most users won’t need third-party apps for screenshots, these tools can be helpful for documentation, tutorials or frequent screen capturing. They offer more features compared to Snipping Tool, like direct upload to external services, templates, annotation tools, etc. to further simplify your workflow.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/how-to-screenshot-on-windows-120024162.html?src=rss",

Magic Cue uses on-device AI to surface relevant information from apps, reducing app-hopping.\nEngadget\nThe camera app also introduces Camera Coach for shooting directions and to highlight various camera modes. While camera hardware is largely unchanged, the Pixel 10 Pro has a new Pro Res Zoom feature, using generative AI for up to 100x zoom, delivering sharper and “just better looking” results than the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra’s zoom, according to Sam Rutherford, who put the phone through its paces. This year’s Pixels also support magnetic Qi2 wireless charging, with what Google calls Pixelsnap. (It’s MagSafe for Pixels.)\nFor those seeking a more affordable option, the Pixel 10, reviewed by me, now includes a 5x telephoto lens, surpassing other base flagships, like the S25 (3x) and iPhone 16 (2x), and incorporates all the Gemini features found in the Pro device. Also, I love the new Indigo Blue.\nWaiting on reviews for the new Pixel Watch and Pixel 10 Pro Fold?

    "summary": "Europe’s biggest gameshow is a beast. Spanning the halls of Cologne Messe, and with E3 now out of the picture, Gamescom is a bigger deal than ever. The show also attracts thousands of public attendees, which gives the show a fairground twist in places. This year, Netflix dominated one of the halls with a faux One Piece ship, sports stadium, a Wednesday-themed cafe and a Stranger Things ice cream stall.\nElsewhere, while Nintendo didn’t have anything new to show, it had plenty of Switch 2 consoles to convince the not-yet-convinced — and some of them had Silksong. Microsoft, too, had a substantial presence, revealing an October 16 launch date for its Xbox Ally duo of handheld gaming PCs. No price, though.\nWhile you can find all the news and previews on our Gamescom page, we’ve also drawn together all the other games we tested during this week’s show, several of which launch in the next few weeks.\n\nMetal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater\nKonami\nWhile the man who created Metal Gear moved onto walking sims and Hollywood best friends, Konami is more than happy to beef up and remaster the hits. This time around, it’s Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater.\nI’ll admit, Snake Eater was when I fell off the Metal Gear Solid train (or nuclear mech), and it came undone by the camouflage system and the difficult-to-navigate early areas. A very tight demo, as the Gamescom crowds rushed to early demos meant I didn’t get a chance to fully test the new style control system that (thankfully) shifts crouch and action/ confirm to separate buttons and adds a degree of camera control even in third-person. But it’s these kind of quality-of-life upgrades you can expect to see.\nOf course, the graphics are a huge leap from the PS2 original (or Nintendo 3DS version I bafflingly chose to buy), but the pulpy (occasionally delightfully camp) dialogue remains in place. I look forward to getting through at least the opening scenes now that the game has launched on PlayStation 5, Windows, and Xbox Series X/S.\n\nThere Are No Ghosts at the Grand\nMicrosoft\nWhat a weird game. Not in a bad way. Things start off in the titular dilapidated Grand Hotel, with me renovating a room with PowerWash Simulator-inspired water guns, spray guns, sand blasters and vacuum. You can scan the area to get hints on what needs doing, while a naggy Scottish smartphone app will also try to help — but not really. There’s also a talking cat, apparently, called Mr. Bones the Bastard, but he wasn’t talking in this demo.\nThe early trailer teased a mystery that needs to be solved in the village, and while I didn’t get a glimpse of that, I was soon tasked with checking out some mysterious black gunk.\nThe developers even put a little more effort into the demo, with voiced lines that will likely never be heard in the retail version, teasing that the protagonist was being “onboarded” when he’s interrupted by one of the characters that populate the village around the hotel.\nSeconds later, I’m riding a scooter to the dock, with a cat enjoying the ride, fixing a boat, getting a sassy soliloquy from the woman who convinced me to drive my boat into the sea. There are plenty more songs to come as new characters join the mystery.\nAs a reminder, the demo started with me sandblasting tatty wallpaper off period walls. I’m intrigued.\n\nResident Evil Requiem\n\nWe’ve got a more detailed breakdown by contributor Alessandro Fillari here, but I got a chance to get scared out of my skin too. The headline feature is the ability to play between first- and third-person perspectives. Still, it revealed an uncomfortable truth to myself: I'm a total coward and playing in third person is much less scary.\n\nOnimusha: Way of the Sword\nCapcom\nCapcom’s return to its samurai vs. demons series is satisfying and fun, especially when compared to more punishing games in the genre, like Sekiro. However, the early chapters have a pretty basic attack flow, and I'm keen to see how things evolve beyond that. At least they’ve got one thing right: a great villain to loathe.\n\nHollow Knight: Silksong\n\nThe long-running DLC-into-sequel-into-meme-sensation is almost here, right? The demo at Gamescom remained the most popular attraction at Microsoft’s booth. Two Xbox Ally handhelds were also running the demo, which I was fortunate enough to test on. And I can say… yep, still plays like a faster, slicker Hollow Knight.\nHaving played it a heady six years ago, it’s now actually difficult to discern the differences between the early build and what is surely an almost-final snapshot of the game. One of the notable changes is its more elaborate lighting effects and details —  things Redditors have pored over as each new trailer video appeared. I stand by my hands-on impressions from 2019, even if they have a fine vintage at this point.\nBut when is it coming out? Oh, September 4. \n\nAll the announcements from Gamescom 2025\n\nCall of Duty: Black Ops 7 arrives on November 14\nXbox Ally handhelds will be available October 16, but we still don't know the price\nXbox unveils its Handheld Compatibility Program\nDouble Fine’s Keeper may have the most endearing video game double act since Banjo and Kazooie\nSony Inzone launches new peripherals in collaboration with Fnatic\nDenshattack! is a blend of Tony Hawk, trains and shonen anime\nBattlestar Galactica might finally get the video game adaption it deserves\nBlack Myth: Zhong Kui is the next title from Game Science Studio\nFromSoft's Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice is becoming an anime\nFallout season two has a teaser trailer and a December 17 release date\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/everything-we-played-at-gamescom-2025-110017871.html?src=rss",

    "full_text": "There is a mouse graveyard in my office cabinet — devices I’ve tried and discarded because they didn’t help with my shoulder aches. The solution was a roller ball mouse and Logitech’s MX Ergo is the best I’ve found. It tilts for a more natural “handshake” grip and has a slow-mo option for more precise movements in Photoshop and other apps. You can even program the various buttons to do app-specific things using Logitech’s software. It's also a handy companion for an iPad and makes a good Mac accessory as well. My only gripe is the antiquated micro-USB charging port, but the battery lasts long enough that I only have to use it once every few months. It’s pricey at $100, so you may prefer the $70 Ergo Lift. It also offers a handshake grip, but without the roller ball, and has Bluetooth or USB dongle connectivity options. Of course, there's also Apple's own Magic Trackpad, which basically replicates the MacBook's touch surface so you can place it anywhere. If you're a fan of the multi-touch gestures on your MacBook, this could be a more comfortable way to use them."

    "full_text": "There are often better and cheaper alternatives to Apple’s first-party accessories, but the company’s MagSafe wireless charger is worth considering if you have a new iPhone. Like all other MagSafe accessories, this charging pad uses magnets to attach to the back of the latest iPhones and it’s surprisingly strong. Not only can you safely pick up your handset and use it with the disk still attached, but the iPhone can dangle by the charger’s cord without falling off. (You still probably shouldn’t do this.) The charging plate itself is about a quarter-inch thick so it barely adds any heft to the iPhone. The magnets only attach to the latest iPhones, but it will still charge older models wirelessly, going back to the iPhone 8. I only wish the cable were longer than three feet so that you had more leeway to use your iPhone on the couch or in bed while powering it up. Apple’s MagSafe charger accessory comes in at $39 (and the latest model will cost you $50), but if you want to spend a bit less, Spigen’s $25 ArcField magnetic wireless charger is a decent dupe. It’s magnets are nowhere near as strong as those on the Apple MagSafe charger — so you definitely shouldn’t pick up your iPhone by this cable — but it’ll power up your handset and stay put while doing so."

    "summary": "\nIn just a few days, the Apple iPhone 17 event will be here — the \"awe dropping\" event is officially confirmed for Tuesday, September 9. If Apple follows its past schedule, that could mean we'll get to download iOS 26 and iPad 26 exactly one week after the event. Coming with the OS 26es are huge upgrades to your iPhone and iPad's operating systems. You've heard of Liquid Glass, right? It's like the better-executed version of Windows Vista and definitely one of the cooler features coming this fall. We spent two weeks test-driving it — you can check out our detailed hands-on iOS 26 preview, or you can try it out yourself by downloading and installing the public beta 5. That software is a more stable iteration of the separate developer version, which recently hit the beta 8 waypoint, and offers a few more flashy features not yet available in the public version. (While the public beta is open to everyone and quite stable, always remember there's a degree of risk involved with beta software.) Additionally, there are credible reports that iOS 26 could bring a new live translation feature to AirPods, too. Not sure if you want to upgrade your smartphone or tablet this year? No worries, we'll help you find out if your devices will be able to run iOS 26.\nWhile Apple didn't nix any iPhones from its eligibility list last year, that's not the case for 2025 — a few models are getting cut this time. All iPhone 8 models and the iPhone X were the last to get the boot in 2023, and this year the 2018 models are getting left behind. If you have an ineligible device, you won't be able to download iOS 26 when it becomes available this fall. \nWe'll get to the bottom of which iPhones and iPads will support iOS 26 and iPadOS 26 this year. To see what's coming with the latest OSes, check out everything announced at Apple's WWDC June 9 event. One thing you shouldn't immediately expect is Apple's updated version of Siri, though the company is reportedly working on a 'stripped-down' AI chatbot to compete with ChatGPT. \nThese three iPhones won't be compatible with iOS 26\nUnlike last year, several iPhone models won't be eligible to download the newest iOS when it makes its debut in September. This trio of models first released in 2018 won't be coming to the iOS 26 party:\n\niPhone XR\niPhone XS\niPhone XS Max\n\niPhones compatible with iOS 26\nWhile we don't yet know the new iPhones Apple will be dropping next month — though there are iPhone 17 rumors — we do know, per Apple's site, that the phones listed below will be compatible with iOS 26. Basically, if you have an iPhone that was announced in 2019 or later, you're in the clear:\n\niPhone SE (second generation or later)\niPhone 11\niPhone 11 Pro\niPhone 11 Pro Max\niPhone 12\niPhone 12 mini\niPhone 12 Pro\niPhone 12 Pro Max\niPhone 13\niPhone 13 mini\niPhone 13 Pro\niPhone 13 Pro Max\niPhone 14\niPhone 14 Plus\niPhone 14 Pro\niPhone 14 Pro Max\niPhone 15\niPhone 15 Plus\niPhone 15 Pro\niPhone 15 Pro Max\niPhone 16\niPhone 16 Plus\niPhone 16 Pro\niPhone 16 Pro Max\niPhone 16e\n\niPads compatible with iPadOS 26\nThe iPads listed below, and any iPads released later this year, are eligible to download iPadOS 26.\n\niPad Pro (M4)\niPad Pro 12.9‑inch (3rd generation and later)\niPad Pro 11‑inch (1st generation and later)\niPad Air (3rd generation and later, including M2 and M3)\niPad (8th generation and later, including A16)\niPad mini (5th generation and later, including A17 Pro)\n\nWhat if I don't want to buy a new iPhone?\nIf you want to continue using your older iPhone that isn't supported by iOS 26, that's fine. However, you'll miss out on security updates which could potentially put your phone at risk for malware and other threats. Additionally, some apps may stop working if they require a certain version of iOS or later. And of course, you won't be able to access the latest features iOS 26 offers.\nWhen will iOS 26 become available?\nApple usually rolls out its latest iOS in mid-September, just a few days before the new iPhones hit store shelves. Last year, it released iOS 18 on Monday, Sept. 16. If it follows suit this year, we should have access to the new operating system on Tuesday, Sept. 16 — exactly one week after the event.\nExpect a confirmation of the release date at the iPhone 17 event on September 9. \niOS 26 features we're excited about\nLiquid Glass design: Your home screen is getting revamped with new app icons, including dark mode and all-clear options. You'll also notice buttons with a new floating design. Liquid Glass was designed to make all of Apple's OSes more cohesive.\nPhone app redesign: You'll finally be able to scroll through contacts, recent calls and voicemail messages all on one screen. It also comes with a new feature called Hold Assist that'll notify you when an agent comes to the phone so you can avoid the elevator music.\nLive Translate: iOS 26 is bringing the ability to have a conversation via phone call or text message with someone who speaks another language. Live Translate will translate your conversation in real time. \nPolls feature: Coming to group messages in the Messages app, chat members will be able to create polls. This can help prevent the unwanted 30+ messages when it comes to deciding which restaurant you're meeting at this weekend.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/apples-new-ios-26-public-beta-5-is-here-but-is-your-iphone-eligible-for-the-update-check-this-list-191854133.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Developers building for Meta’s metaverse platform will soon be able to create AI-powered NPCs for Horizon Worlds. The company previewed the move, which is coming “very soon” as part of a developer update that adds new generative AI tools for developers. Once available, developers will be able to use Meta’s Worlds Desktop Editor to create NPCs that can  hold “lifelike” conversations with players via voice chat. The company has previously experimented with NPCs for its metaverse, but the upcoming update will be the first time developers have access to customizable embodied characters.For players, this means the NPCs they encounter will be able to engage more dynamically and respond to specific interactions rather than only relying on scripted responses. In a blog post, Meta shared a video that shows how developers can customize their characters’ appearance and create a backstory and instructions that determine how it responds to players.

    "full_text": "Developers building for Meta’s metaverse platform will soon be able to create AI-powered NPCs for Horizon Worlds. The company previewed the move, which is coming “very soon” as part of a developer update that adds new generative AI tools for developers. Once available, developers will be able to use Meta’s Worlds Desktop Editor to create NPCs that can hold “lifelike” conversations with players via voice chat. The company has previously experimented with NPCs for its metaverse, but the upcoming update will be the first time developers have access to customizable embodied characters. For players, this means the NPCs they encounter will be able to engage more dynamically and respond to specific interactions rather than only relying on scripted responses. In a blog post, Meta shared a video that shows how developers can customize their characters’ appearance and create a backstory and instructions that determine how it responds to players.

Last week’s deal included a five-year warrant that would allow the U.S. government to take an additional 5% of Intel, at $20 a share, if the company held less than 51% equity in its foundry business. “I think from the government’s perspective, they were aligned with that; they didn’t want to see us take the business and spin it off or sell it to somebody,” he said.

The decision to build its own models, despite having sunk billion-dollar investments in the newer AI company, indicates that Microsoft wants to be an independent competitor in this space. While that could take time to reach parity with the companies that have emerged as forerunners in AI development, Suleyman told Semafor that Microsoft has \"an enormous five-year roadmap that we're investing in quarter after quarter.\" With some concerns arising that AI could be facing a bubble-pop, Microsoft's timeline will need to be aggressive to ensure taking the independent path is worthwhile.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/microsoft-introduces-a-pair-of-in-house-ai-models-193003900.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "You might already have a good idea of which smartphone you want to be your next one. But there are more solid options available now than ever before, making the decision not as cut-and-dry as it used to be. While the decision is a bit easier if you know you want an iPhone, there's even enough variation between those new models that you may have to think about it longer than you anticipated. If you’re an Android person, you have even more options to choose from — including foldables — and more questions to answer before you spend any money.At Engadget, we review phones regularly and have tested dozens over the years. Whether you’ve had your eye on one of our current top picks, one of Samsung's Galaxy S25 phones, a cheap phone or another device, we’re here to help you decide which is the best phone to buy this year.\nAndroid or iOS?\nWhen you're searching for the best smartphone, it becomes clear that each OS has its pros and cons. Apple’s tight-knit ecosystem makes it super easy to share data between iPhones, iPads and Macs or seamlessly hand-off phone calls or music from one device to another. At the same time, you’re effectively locked in, as services like Apple Messages aren’t available on other platforms. \nAs for Android, there’s a much wider range of handsets from companies like Google, Samsung, Sony and more. However, Android phones don’t enjoy that same length of software support and often have lower trade-in values. In short, there’s no wrong answer. However, you will want to consider how your phone will fit in with the rest of your devices. So unless you’re really fed up with one OS and willing to learn another, it probably doesn’t make a lot of sense to switch from an iPhone to an Android phone (or vice versa) – especially if everyone else in your household is using the same platform.\nCameras\nSince your cell phone often pulls double duty as your primary camera, figuring out what kind of photo tools you want is key. Nowadays, practically every mobile phone can take a great picture in bright light. But if you want a long optical zoom, you’ll probably have to upgrade to a more expensive device.\n\n\n\n\n   Cherlynn Low / Engadget \n \n\nMid-range phones often only have two rear cameras (a primary wide-angle lens and a secondary ultra-wide camera) and can sometimes struggle in low-light situations. Each phone maker also has various features that might be a better fit for your style, with Apple offering four different color presets on the latest iPhones, while Google’s Pixel 9 Pro comes with neat tools like dedicated long exposure and Action Pan modes.\nWill you get mmWave 5G or Wi-Fi 7?\nThe good news is that in 2025, most phones have at least Wi-Fi 6 or Wi-Fi 6e and support for some kind of 5G connectivity. However, if you want the fastest wireless speeds possible, it’s going to cost you a little extra. For example, on certain networks, mmWave 5G offers up to gigabit download speeds, less latency and better bandwidth. But mmWave 5G also requires more sophisticated (and pricier) modems, which means support for it is often missing on less expensive devices.\nOn the bright side, mmWave 5G isn’t as widely available as other versions of 5G, so depending on where you live and what network you’re on, you may not be missing out on much right now if you buy a phone that doesn’t support it. It’s a similar situation for Wi-Fi 7, which is available on some high-end handsets like the Galaxy S25, but harder to find on cheaper devices. Wi-Fi 7 also requires you to have a compatible router, so unless you know you need it or have a specific use case in mind, the lack of support for mmWave 5G or Wi-Fi 7 shouldn’t be a dealbreaker when looking for a new phone.\nOther features to consider\nBecause not everyone agrees on what makes the best phone, you should think about any other specs that might be extra important for you. Mobile gamers will almost certainly appreciate the 120Hz refresh rates you get on phones like the Samsung Galaxy S25 or the Apple iPhone 16 Pro. Alternatively, if long battery life is important, you’ll probably want to go with a larger iPhone or an Android phone with a battery that’s between 4,000 and 5,000 mAh in size. Meanwhile, if you find yourself juggling a lot of devices, it can be really nice to have a phone that supports reverse wireless charging, which on Samsung phones even lets you recharge the company’s Galaxy Watches.\n \n \n \n \n \n \nOther smartphones we've tested\nOnePlus 13\nWhile the OnePlus 13 features some basic AI features like Google’s Circle to Search and Gemini assistant, it’s really just an old-fashioned flagship in all the best ways. That’s because instead of focusing on machine learning, OnePlus crammed the phone with tons of top-notch hardware. It sports a 6.8-inch OLED display with an incredible peak brightness of up to 4,500 nits. The OP13 also offers excellent performance thanks to Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 8 Elite chip, along with 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage. There are also three 50-MP rear cameras including one with a 3x telephoto zoom and a massive 6,000 mAh battery that’s bigger than what you get in practically all of its competitors.\nOnePlus didn’t skimp on the phone’s design either, as the OP13 still comes with the company’s signature Alert Slider. Plus, if you opt for the blue or white variants, you’ll get a durable and very touchable vegan leather back that helps the phone stand out among all its glass brick rivals. But the best part is that starting at $900, it costs less than an equivalent Galaxy S25+ too.\nFAQs\nHow do I know which smartphone is the best for me?\nWhile choosing the best smartphone can be challenging, it mostly comes down to how you plan on using the device. All of the best phones available now get the basics right — you’ll be able to make calls, text and access the internet without many hiccups. If your smartphone is your most used gadget, you may want to consider paying for a device on the higher end of the price spectrum. That will get you better overall performance, higher-quality cameras and a phone that will last for many years. If you don’t use your phone for everything, you may be able to compromise on performance and extra perks and spend less on a still-capable handset.\nHow much is a smartphone?\nSmartphones range in price from $300 to over $1,500. The best budget phones available now will usually compromise on overall performance, design, camera prowess and extra features to keep costs down. On the flip side, the most expensive phones will have powerful processors, triple-camera arrays and even flip or fold designs. Most people will find a phone that fits their needs somewhere in the middle of that wide price range — we’ve found that most of the best smartphones available right now cost between $500 and $1,000.\nWhat can you do on a smartphone?\nSmartphones are essentially small, portable computers that let you do things like check email, browse social media, follow map directions, make contactless payments and more. This is all on top of the basics like making phone calls and texting, which we’ve come to expect in all modern cell phones. Smartphones have also mostly replaced compact cameras thanks to their high-quality, built-in shooters, and the fact that most smartphones today as just as portable, if not more so, as compact cameras.\nHow long do smartphones last?\nSmartphones can last years and people are holding on to their phones longer now than ever before. Software updates and battery life are two of the biggest factors that can affect phone longevity. Apple promises five years worth of software updates for its latest iPhones, and Google promises the same for its Pixel phones. Samsung phones will get four years worth of Android updates from the time they launch. As for charging speeds and battery life, your phone can deteriorate over time as you use and recharge your phone on a regular basis.\nRecent updates\nAugust 2025: Updated to include the Google Pixel 10 Pro.\nJuly 2025: Updated to include the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7.\nApril 2025: Updated to include the Google Pixel 9a.\nFebruary 2025: Updated to include the iPhone 16e.\nJanuary 2025: Updated to include details about Samsung's latest Galaxy S-series phones.\nSeptember 2024: Updated to include the latest iPhone 16 models and a new midrange iPhone top pick.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/best-smartphones-140004900.html?src=rss",

But mmWave 5G also requires more sophisticated (and pricier) modems, which means support for it is often missing on less expensive devices. As we discovered in our testing for the iPhone 16 Pro review, it’ll take a bit of getting used to at first. Not only do both devices now support full high-res portrait shots, its 100x Pro Res Zoom captures long-range photos in ways that lenses and megapixels alone simply can’t. Then you add in noticeably better performance, bigger batteries, brighter displays and proper Qi2 magnetic charging (the first from a major Android phone maker) via Pixelsnap and you have truly smart devices that makes picking anything else seem kind of dumb. So while it's not super fancy, the phone has all of its most important bases covered (and then some). Sadly there’s still no dedicated telephoto lens, which makes it less useful in some shooting situations. But the best part is that starting at $900, it costs less than an equivalent Galaxy S25+ too."

It will support VOD, Unlimited DVR and Family Share features.\nFubo\nYou can argue that Fubo's new sports package is the best value for football fans. At $56, it's pricier than the upcoming ESPN and Fox One bundle. (It arrives on October 2 for $40.) By comparison, Fubo's package includes all the same sports channels, as well as local stations (and more). NFL and college football fans subscribing to this could also likely skip Paramount+'s sports content. The football completist would only need to add Peacock for NBC's Sunday night games and Amazon Prime for its Thursday night matchups.\nConfused? Well, you aren't alone. In many ways, live TV streaming has become at least as convoluted as the cable TV it once promised to improve upon. Start with something simple, insert high stakes for wealthy corporations and watch a complex web of head-spinning shit come out the other side.\nRegardless, starting next week, you can try Fubo Sports for $46 for your first month. After that, it defaults to the standard $56. The bundle arrives on September 2, two days before the NFL season kicks off.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/fubo-sports-will-make-a-play-for-football-fans-dollars-on-september-2-164847466.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "The RX1R III is an incredible camera, capable of capturing stunning photos. However, for something Sony waited nearly a decade to update and is charging $5,100 for, it also feels like a missed opportunity. First, the RX1R III is nearly $2,000 more expensive than its predecessor. Plus, it’s missing a handful of features the company really should have included for it to hold its own against other high-end compact cameras, including Fujifilm’s X100VI and GFX100RF, as well as the Leica Q3 family. I love the RX1R III, but I wish it was easier to recommend.\n \nImage quality and autofocus\n\n\n\n\n   Igor Bonifacic for Engadget \n \n\nNew to the RX1R III is a 61-megapixel full-frame sensor Sony first introduced alongside the A7R IV back in 2019. It might be an old component, but having so much resolution in a camera I could carry everywhere felt like cheating. \nWhat hasn't changed is the glass on the RX1R III. The camera still has the same fixed 35mm f/2.0 Zeiss lens that debuted on the original RX1R in 2012. With past models, autofocus was often an issue, but it turns out the Zeiss lens wasn't to blame. It was the focusing algorithms on the older cameras.\nLike the A7R V, the RX1R III comes with Sony's flagship Bionz XR image processor and a dedicated chip for AI-assisted subject detection. At first, I was skeptical of the RX1R III's autofocus capabilities since the camera doesn't come with a joystick to make it easy to set a focus point manually. As it turns out, it doesn't need one. The autofocus on the RX1R III feels magical, thanks to its subject tracking. The seven different recognition modes offered by the RX1R III cover most of the things I like to shoot — including people, pets and birds — and getting the camera to lock onto a subject was simple. All I had to do was press and hold the new \"AF-ON\" button. The camera can be configured to prioritize specific subjects, but I found that wasn't necessary to do; I could delegate focusing entirely to the camera.\nAll of that brings me back to the RX1R III's Zeiss glass. I know some people will be disappointed Sony didn't add a new lens, but I'm a fan of the decision. For me, the character of that lens has always been part of the appeal of the series, and it's my favorite aspect of the new model.\nWith Sony's 61MP sensor behind it, the Zeiss optics can capture photos with a great amount of detail without ever feeling clinical or overly sharp like with many of the company's G Master lenses. The best way I can describe the rendering is that it's Leica-like with beautiful, creamy bokeh. With the right light, the RX1R III can produce images that look almost painterly, and reviewing the photos I snapped with it, they're among some of the best I've captured in the 10 years I've been shooting.\nAt the same time, I think Sony deserves credit for greatly improving the color science of its JPEGs. The company has long offered excellent RAW support, but the older I get, the more I appreciate a camera that can produce great images with minimal editing. With the RX1R III, Sony has delivered that. The camera offers a total of 12 JPEG profiles with six custom slots. Two of the default profiles, Film 2 and Film 3, are borrowed from the FX3, and offer calming, muted tones that are a nice contrast to the more vivid colors Sony is typically known for.\nAs for video, there's not much to say. The RX1R III can capture 4K footage at 60 frames per second and 1080p clips at 120 fps. That said, as I'll get to in a moment, Sony's new model is missing some features that would have made it a competent video camera. As things stand, I think it's only suited for capturing home videos you don't plan to share with the world.\nDesign and handling\n\n\n\n\n   Igor Bonifacic for Engadget \n \n\nThe first time I looked through the RX1R III's viewfinder, I thought Sony had sent me a defective unit. The redesigned EVF is now built into the top left of the camera, but the company seems to have pulled the screen from the parts bin, as it only offers 2.36 million dots of resolution. For context, the A7R V has a 9.44-million-dot OLED EVF, while the older A7R IV has a 5.76-million-dot screen. It's jarring going from the new rear-panel LCD and viewfinder. It also feels cheap. A $5,100 camera should include a top-of-the-line EVF.\nThe viewfinder is not the only part of the RX1R III that left me confused about what Sony was thinking. There's the rear screen I just mentioned, which is both better and worse than the one before. On the one hand, it offers nearly double the resolution, thanks to its 2.36-million-dot panel. On the other hand, it's no longer articulating, which feels like a major step back since it makes shooting candid shots from the hip a lot harder. And forget about vlogging or taking selfies.\nSeparately, Sony hasn't weather-sealed the III. Again, that's a feature I'd like to see on such an expensive camera. Thankfully, battery life is improved, with the RX1R III supporting Sony's larger NP-FW50 batteries. I could comfortably get a day of shooting out of the latest model if I was good about powering off the camera when I wasn't using it.\nI could overlook all the complaints I mentioned if Sony had just added in-body image stabilization (IBIS). When I reviewed the Fujifilm X100VI last year, that feature alone felt transformational. More than just improving image quality, it made the X100VI into a camera that could shoot in nearly any light. I understand Sony likely wanted to keep the III small and light, but again, $5,100 is a lot to pay to not have a feature that many high-end cameras offer.\nWrap-up\nI've mentioned a few of the RX1R III’s competitors in passing, but now I think it makes sense to consider where Sony's new camera fits in the market. Most people shopping for a premium compact camera will probably start their search with the X100VI. If you can find one in stock, it's significantly cheaper than the RX1R III, coming in at $1,800. Sure, you're forgoing a full-frame sensor for a smaller APS-C sensor. But for most people, I think that's a fair tradeoff, especially when the X100VI also offers IBIS, an articulating screen, an optical viewfinder and Fujifilm's excellent color simulations.\nIf you want the largest possible sensor, I'd argue Fujifilm's GFX100RF, which has a medium-format 100MP sensor, makes more sense — even with all of its faults and a price increase coming at the end of the month. There are also the Leica Q3 and Q3 43 to consider. At $6,735 and $7,380 respectively, both are more expensive than the RX1R III, but come with nicer displays, IBIS and Leica glass.\nLike I said at the start, I wish the RX1R III was easier to recommend, but it occupies a strange space where it's not necessarily better or different enough from its rivals. Inflation and Trump's tariffs likely tied Sony's hands to a degree, but the company could have still made the new model more compelling by avoiding some of its questionable design decisions.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cameras/sony-rx1r-iii-review-waiting-10-years-to-be-underwhelmed-160036397.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Bose announced its latest earbuds in June, but the QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds (2nd gen) ($299) won’t arrive until early September. Today, though, they’re available for preorder, and I’ve spent the last few weeks testing all the new features. This model is an overhaul of the noise-canceling earbuds the company debuted in 2023 alongside its take on spatial audio. Among the upgrades, Bose has improved the active noise cancellation (ANC) performance, enhanced call quality and added wireless charging to the case. Two years later, the QuietComfort Ultra is still the best option for those primarily concerned with blocking distractions, and Bose’s tweaks make its best earbuds even better.\n \nWhat’s new on the QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds (2nd gen)?\nThe new QC Ultra Earbuds are at their best in Quiet mode. This is Bose’s option for full noise cancellation without spatial audio (or Immersive Audio, as the company calls it). Here, there’s no doubt these are still the best noise-cancelling earbuds available right now. The first-gen version achieved the same feat, but Bose has gone a step further to enhance its ANC setup for this refresh. \nSpecifically, the company updated the algorithm for its ActiveSense technology in Aware (transpancy) Mode. Now the QC Ultra Earbuds offer smoother changes in ANC levels to combat sudden spikes in ambient noise. This means things like sirens should no longer drown out your music or podcast. Unfortunately, I wasn’t able to trigger the retooled adaptive ANC with simulated police sirens from YouTube — the best option on my quiet cul-de-sac — but I’ll report back if I notice any oddities here.\nBose also upgraded call quality on the QC Ultra Earbuds. The company says a new AI-powered setup, known as SpeechClarity, works with “the earbuds’ eight microphones, dynamic mixing and adaptive filters” to focus on your voice. Bose explains that it uses audio augmentation tech that was originally developed for hearing aids here, which can reduce background noise like wind or the drone of an office. During my tests, the revised system silenced a noisy fan, rendering it completely absent from my recordings. However, overall voice quality suffers as you will sound a bit staticky when all the audio processing kicks in.\nThankfully, you no longer need an additional accessory for wireless charging on the QC Ultra Earbuds. With the first-gen model, you had to buy a separate cover to enable cable-free recharging. Bose has now built all of that into the case for the second-gen set, a welcome upgrade that really should’ve been here from the start. When the original QC Ultra Earbuds debuted in 2023, wireless charging was certainly already the norm.\nWhat’s still great about the QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds (2nd gen)?\n\n\n\n\n   Billy Steele for Engadget \n \n\nAs I mentioned, the overall ANC performance of the QC Ultra Earbuds remains unmatched. If you’re looking to block out distractions, this is the best option that still offers great sound quality. Bose even manages to cancel out human voices better than most of its rivals, which can be a struggle for much of the competition.\nAudio quality on these earbuds remains near the top of the heap. You won’t notice as much detail as Noble Audio’s FoKus Rex5 or Technics’ AZ100, but there’s great clarity here nonetheless. Bose says the tuning was “slightly refined” for improved bass response and smoother high frequencies. I noticed that tracks with deep bass, like Deftones’ “locked club,” are clearer at the low end. Meanwhile, treble-forward instruments in songs like Miles Davis’ “Green Haze” sound crisper and cleaner than before.\nDespite their larger size, this year’s buds offer a surprisingly balanced and comfortable fit. Bose refreshed the ear tips for the QC Ultra Earbuds with a new guard to prevent wax build up. Touch controls are still reliable, and you can disable them entirely on this second-gen version.\nWhat’s not so good about the QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds (2nd gen)?\nThe biggest gripe I have with the overhaul of the QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds is the lack of improvement to battery life. I was disappointed to see that a better runtime wasn’t part of the upgrades when I read the announcement in June, and I’m still not over it. On this model, you’ll get up to six hours of use with ANC turned on. Like before, if you listen with that spatial Immersive Audio enabled, that drops to four hours. A couple more hours would’ve been nice, enough to keep the QC Ultra Earbuds in place for a full work day without having to give them a lunch break in the case.\nWhile the design doesn’t bother me too much, I know the look of the QC Ultra Earbuds isn’t for everyone. There is a bit of a mini Bluetooth headset vibe going on here, and the overall size of the buds are on the larger side when much of the competition is racing to be the smallest. Like I said, none of this impacts comfort or stability, and I’d bet many prospective buyers are willing to live with the aesthetic in exchange for the type of silence the QC Ultra Earbuds deliver.\nWrap-up\nThe upgrades on the second-gen QC Ultra Earbuds don’t make for a wildly new product, but they do provide enough for a notable improvement over the previous version. ANC and call performance are both enhanced, and though it’s late to the party, the addition of built-in wireless charging is a welcome change. Other updates, like the tuning tweaks and the ability to turn off touch controls, are quality-of-life changes that undoubtedly improve the overall experience. Bose has done all of this without changing the price from the 2023 model, which is a surprising choice in the current economic climate. Simply put, the QC Ultra Earbuds remain the best option for wireless noise-cancelling earbuds, and that’s not likely to change anytime soon.\nThe Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds (2nd gen) are available for preorder in the US today, August 28. The general on-sale date is scheduled for September 10.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/bose-quietcomfort-ultra-earbuds-2nd-gen-review-still-a-noise-canceling-powerhouse-153017601.html?src=rss",
