    "full_text": "Before sixteen-year-old Adam Raine died by suicide, he had spent months consulting ChatGPT about his plans to end his life. Now, his parents are filing the first known wrongful death lawsuit against OpenAI, the New York Times reports. Many consumer-facing AI chatbots are programmed to activate safety features if a user expresses intent to harm themselves or others. But research has shown that these safeguards are far from foolproof. In Raine’s case, while using a paid version of ChatGPT-4o, the AI often encouraged him to seek professional help or contact a help line. OpenAI has addressed these shortcomings on its blog. “As the world adapts to this new technology, we feel a deep responsibility to help those who need it most,” the post reads. “We are continuously improving how our models respond in sensitive interactions.” “We have learned over time that these safeguards can sometimes be less reliable in long interactions: as the back-and-forth grows, parts of the model’s safety training may degrade.” Character.AI, another AI chatbot maker, is also facing a lawsuit over its role in a teenager’s suicide."

    "full_text": "A security researcher has found over a thousand publicly exposed hobby servers run by Tesla vehicle owners that are spilling sensitive data about their vehicles, including their granular location histories. Seyfullah Kiliç, founder of cybersecurity company SwordSec, said he found over 1,300 internet-exposed TeslaMate dashboards on the internet, likely made public by mistake, allowing anyone to access the person’s Tesla data stored inside without needing a password. TeslaMate is an open-source data logger that allows Tesla owners to self-host and visualize their vehicle’s data from their own computers, such as their vehicle’s temperature, battery health, and charging sessions, but also more sensitive information, like vehicle speed and the location data of recent trips. In a blog post, Kiliç said he scanned the internet for public-facing TeslaMate dashboards and scraped the vehicle’s last-seen location and Tesla model names, and visualized the vehicles on a map to show their locations. Kiliç told TechCrunch that this was to raise awareness of the number of exposed servers, and urged TeslaMate users to secure their dashboards. While not a new problem, Kiliç shows that the number of exposed TeslaMate dashboards has gone up significantly since the last count back in 2022, when a security researcher at the time found dozens of public TeslaMate dashboards exposed to the web. Now, more than three years later, another security researcher has found more than a thousand self-hosted TeslaMate servers on the web and mapped them, showing that the problem has seemingly gotten worse. TeslaMate’s founder Adrian Kumpf, told TechCrunch in 2022 that a bug fix was rolled out that aimed to protect against public access to customers’ dashboards, but warned that the project could not protect against users accidentally exposing their TeslaMate servers to the internet. Kiliç said TeslaMate users should enable authentication on their servers to prevent public access. “If you plan to run TeslaMate on a public-facing server, you must secure it,” wrote Kiliç."

    "full_text": "Instead of restricting users to an algorithmic main feed, as is common on social apps, Skylight is building a community around human curators who post and repost videos to build out their own custom feeds others can subscribe to. Built on Bluesky’s social network and its underlying AT Protocol, Skylight first launched in April to offer an open alternative to video apps like TikTok. Since then, the app has seen roughly 240,000 downloads and 100,000 videos uploaded to its platform. Skylight also received early funding from Mark Cuban and others. Like others in this space, Skylight’s ability to authenticate users with their Bluesky credentials gives it a head start on building its own user base. With Skylight’s 2.0 launch, the company is focusing on improved curation. Users can now create their own “curator” feed by posting and reposting videos or by using third-party tools to build their own custom feed. Soon, the company will integrate technology from the custom feed-building platform Graze to allow Skylight users to create those custom feeds inside its own app, as well. Those curators you already follow will be included in this experience. Those videos can help spike app installs, at times."

This requirement will then roll out globally in “2027 and beyond.” Identity verification is already a requirement for Google Play, so this change mostly impacts developers who solely distribute their apps outside of the Play Store. “By making Android safer, we’re protecting the open environment that allows developers and users to confidently create and connect,” Google said in its announcement. “Android’s new developer verification is an extra layer of security that deters bad actors and makes it harder for them to spread harm.” Related Google will automatically revoke permissions from harmful Android apps This update aims to prevent users who install apps outside of Google Play from falling victim to malware and scams, making it harder for developers who release malicious apps to return under a new alias when they get removed. Apple also introduced similar developer requirements for the EU App Store in February to comply with the Digital Services Act (DSA), which requires online platforms to verify “traders” who distribute products and services to consumers in the EU through their platform. Android developer verification is largely targeting commercial developers, with Google saying that it’s “committed to keeping Android an open platform” for student and hobbyist developers. Google is creating a separate Android developer console to facilitate this, which will place restrictions on the number of apps and installs."

Gemini 2.5 Flash’s native image editor blends photos of a dog and person, while keeping their likeness. Google claims its new AI image model is state-of-the-art on several benchmarks. To keep up with OpenAI and Google, Meta announced last week that it would license AI image models from the startup Midjourney. Meanwhile, the a16z-backed German unicorn Black Forest Labs continues to dominate benchmarks with its FLUX AI image models. Perhaps Gemini’s impressive AI image editor can help Google close its user gap with OpenAI. On Google’s earnings call in July, the tech giant’s CEO Sundar Pichai revealed that Gemini had 450 million monthly users — implying weekly users are even lower. Brichtova says Google specifically designed the image model with consumer use cases in-mind, such as helping users visualize their home and garden projects.

However, that means a subscription gives publishers $4 for turning over their entire library, a significant decrease from the $20 to $30 many newspapers now charge for access. \nPerplexity's current Publisher Program provides shares of ad revenue that a publisher might have received if users clicked on their articles, rather than reading Perplexity's summary. \nThese moves create the appearance of Perplexity trying to act above board, but the most recent lawsuit isn't the first time reports have emerged of Perplexity raking websites' content without permission. It's not even the first time this month. \nAn early August report from Cloudfare found that Perplexity has allegedly deployed web crawlers to sneak around robots.txt files and firewalls. Cloudfare claims that Perplexity is impersonating Google Chrome with a generic browser and rotating through IP addresses not linked to the company. \nPerplexity also faced a series of accusations in the summer of 2024. Forbes accused the company of illicitly pulling its stories and publishing them, while Wired reported that Perplexity was scraping content from it and other Condé Nast-owned publications. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/perplexity-sued-by-japanese-media-giants-for-stealing-information-and-presenting-false-information-133048116.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "If you've put off getting a new MacBook then today is your lucky day. Right now, the 2025 13- and 15-inch MacBook Air M4 are available on Amazon for record-low prices thanks to Labor Day sales. The 13-inch model is our pick for best MacBook to buy this year, and it's one of the best laptops for college students going back to school soon as well.\nYou can pick up the 13-inch MacBook Air M4 for $799, down from $999 — a 20 percent discount. This model comes with 16GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD. You can upgrade to 512GB SSD for $999, down from $1,199, another all-time low price, or 24GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD for $1,199, down from $1,399. \n \nThen there's the 15-inch MacBook Air M4, whose cheapest model is on sale for $999, dropping from $1,199. The 17 percent discount is the best deal we've seen since the pair debuted in March. As with the 13-inch model, the 16GB and 512GB SSD option is also a record-low price, dropping to $1,199 from $1,399. Then there's the 24GB upgrade, which is $1,399, down from $1,599.\nWe're big fans of the MacBook Air M4, giving it a 92 in our review. Part of that comes from an already lower starting price for the MacBooks than their predecessors. The 2025 models also get a speed boost thanks to the M4 chip and are very thin with a 0.44-inch thickness. Neither the 13- or 15-inch will drag you down, weighing 2.7 pounds and 3.2 pounds, respectively. Plus, they both have excellent battery life, lasting over 18 hours while playing an HD video. \nThe big differences in the 15-inch model mostly come down to size. The screen is obviously bigger, as is its trackpad. Other than that, it offers better speakers than its 13-inch sibling. \n \nCheck out our coverage of the best Apple deals for more discounts, and follow @EngadgetDeals on X for the latest tech deals and buying advice.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/labor-day-sales-include-the-apple-macbook-air-m4-for-a-record-low-price-123031107.html?src=rss",

While the broad strokes of the mouse’s design will be familiar to existing MX Master owners, it’s apparently been tweaked with a “more durable, slightly textured surface,” and transparent main buttons. Apparently it’ll all be customizable, including vibration intensity. There’ll also be a new “Action Ring” menu with shortcuts, and quiet clicks in line with the 3S, though there are no bumps to battery or DPI. I’ve been holding off on a new mouse because of rumors the MX Master 4 would launch soon, so I’ll be as keen as anyone else to hear more about it. The MX Master 3 launched all the way back in 2019, with the quieter 3S in 2022, so we’ve been due an upgrade."

    "summary": "Silent Hill f starts off with a grounded (but still heavy) setup, establishing a miserable family dynamic for protagonist Hinako.  With an alcoholic,  abusive father, a submissive mother and an absent sister, who’s shown in flashbacks with that classic horror trope, face unseen. Something horrible is about to unfold in the sleepy, remote village of Ebisugaoka, sometime in the early 1960s.\nThe latest entry in the Silent Hill series still has jumpscares, like you’d expect from the horror series, but both the setting and game systems are more focused on tension, putting both Hinako and the player under constant duress. A typical health meter is joined by a sanity gauge and even your weapons have limited durability, so you’re forced to pick your fights.\nDuring a two-hour demo, I had to do exactly that. As Hinako escapes her family home to find someone, anyone, to talk to, the village is eerily empty. A kei truck blocks the direct route to the local shop, with a crushed bird nearby adding to the weird. Soon, a sinister fog and red undergrowth attack four assembled high school students. \nKonami\nOf course, it only gets weirder. As marionette nightmares pop up, all Hinako can do is run and evade attacks. A focus mode, pressing L1, burns the sanity gauge but gives better prompts for both dodging and eventually counter-attacking monsters.\nHinako is no soldier. She’s no battle-hardened survivor. When I eventually find a steel pipe to fight back with, even fast attacks are a little sluggish, while heavy swings, which can often stun and knock down enemies, take a while to charge up and can be hard to aim if you haven’t locked onto the enemy. If there’s more than one attacker, it’s a tense struggle and I’m often forced to burn through recovery items more so than when facing a sound and light-sensitive crawling beast, a fleshy-spherical ogre and other middleweight boss fights.\nFortunately, there are hokora, miniature Shinto shrines, dotted around the village, which act as save points. The eerie location of Ebisugaoka and when a friend continually calls Hinako a \"traitor\" further amplify the sense of dread. The older sister is briefly shown during a flashback, but her face is obscured. Even in the younger sister’s journal, the biog page for the sister is covered in scribbles and ink. It’s very Japanese Horror, and less shotgun-to-the-zombie-face. And just plain stressful.\nA new sanity system is intriguing too. It's not an entirely new premise: the Gamecube's Eternal Darkness would manipulate the graphics and sound within the game as the character's sanity declined. But that was, depressingly, over 20 years ago. \nSome items can top up your sanity, but if you don’t use them, you can offer them at a shrine for an in-game currency and spend that on charms to boost Hinako’s stats. I managed to afford a stamina-boosting charm during my playthrough and was tantalizingly close to affording another charm before getting cut down by scarecrows dressed as high-schoolers.\nThe scarecrow confrontation is hopefully a good example of nuanced puzzles that will appear in the full game. Initially, a bloodied rag tells you to take the thorns out of the one scarecrow that isn’t part of the group – the one that isn’t going to cut you up with their sickle. Unfortunately, all of the scarecrows have a thorn, so you’re tasked with finding the pattern of his group.\nKonami\nThe entire experience is drenched in atmosphere, supported by this new sanity system — is there anything more 2025 than a mental health gauge? The constant feeling of isolation (\"Where is everyone?\") and unanswered questions made the demo a persuasive introduction to the game. A particularly tense moment involves collapsing after a fight, further emphasizing the character's vulnerability. Also, there’s some kind of dashing fox spirit in a mask, who coaxes Hinako through the dreamlike, blood-soaked temple areas. The mysterious fox spirit knows her name, which adds yet another layer of intrigue. \nI hope all will be made clear when the game launches, roughly a month from now.\nSilent Hill f launches on PlayStation 5, Windows and Xbox Series X/S on September 25  2025.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/silent-hill-f-preview-gamescom-2025-123030305.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Hasselblad has launched the followup to its first 100MP medium-format camera with a new model that improves on it in almost every way. The X2D II 100C promises better image quality, a brighter display, 10-stop stabilization and updated hybrid autofocus. As with any Hasselblad product, it's expensive — but less so than the previous model. \nThe original X2D 100C took beautiful photos but lacked even basic technology like continuous autofocus. That's no longer the case. The X2D II 100C is the first Hasselblad camera with AF-C phase-detect AF backed by AI algorithms and LiDAR assistance, finally allowing burst shooting for movings subjects (albeit at a low 3 fps). With those changes, the new model promises \"fast and accurate\" AF, especially, in low light — which would be a big improvement over the previous model. \nAt the same time, Hasselblad is pushing the image quality envelope further. The X2D II 100C is the first medium-format camera to support true end-end-end HDR, which reduces overexposure, enhances highlight retention and improves tonal depth for more natural looking images. Those can then be viewed directly on the display as HDR HEIF or Ultra HDR JPEG images. The updated 100MP BSI sensor also delivers 16-bit RAW images and up to 15.3 stops of dynamic range, among the highest of any camera available.\nHasselblad\nAnother key change is the updated 5-axis in-body stabilization system. It now delivers up to 10 stops, more than any other camera (Fujifilm's GFX100 II offers 8 stops and some Canon models go up to 8.5 stops) — perfect for a high-resolution camera where sharpness is critical. With the new system, Hasselblad claims you can capture \"hand-held long exposures lasting several seconds without a tripod\" for extra creative possibilities. \nThe X2D II 100C weighs 7.5 percent less than the X2D 100C at around 730 grams without a lens — not bad at all for a medium format camera. The grip has also been updated with a textured surface to \"enhance comfort and control,\" the company wrote. \nOther updates include a new 3.6-inch touch display with 1,400 nits of peak brightness that tilts 90 degrees upward and 43 degrees downward to make high and low angle shooting easier. Hasselblad also included a 5D joystick to change focus or operate the menus, addressing a big user complaint about the X2D 100C. It comes with 1TB of built-in storage as before — something almost no other mirrorless camera offers — along with a CFexpress Type B slot (as before, there's no support for video). Finally, Hasselblad introduced a new app, Phocus Mobile 2, that allows users to remotely control the camera, transfer shots and even edit them. \nHasselblad\nAs for the price, it's less shocking than you may expect. The Hasselblad X2D II 100C is now on sale for $7,399, $800 less than the X2D 100C at launch and (perhaps strategically) $100 less than rival Fujifilm's GFX100 II was at launch. \nHasselblad also introduced a new zoom lens, the XCD 2.8-4 35-100E (28-76mm full-frame equivalent). It promises \"top-tier\" optical performance and the fastest stepping motor in its XCD lens lineup, along with control rings for shutter speed, aperture and more. Like all Hasselblad lenses, it incorporates a leaf shutter that allows for up to 1/4000th flash sync speeds for easier use of fill light in bright conditions. The XCD 2.8-4 35-100E is now available for $4,599. \nFinally, the company introduced the $469 Hasselblad-branded Vandra 20-liter backpack that will help you flaunt the brand name even if the camera's tucked away. It can hold an X2D II 100C body, two lenses and accessories. Finally, Hasselblad unveiled three new 86mm filters: a UV for $299, ND ($329) and circular polarizer (CPL) for $559.

    "full_text": "Where most Frontier deals to date have bought carbon from startups specializing in direct air capture, enhanced weathering, or bioenergy with carbon capture, the organization’s agreement with Planetary is its first to do so by enhancing ocean alkalinity. The deal effectively prices each metric ton of carbon at $270, though Planetary says it has a plan to eventually remove carbon for less than $100 per metric ton. At full tilt, ocean alkalinity enhancement could remove over 1 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide annually. That has slowed the pace of global warming, but it also endangers a host of marine organisms, including coral and shellfish, which depend on alkaline waters to help build and maintain their calcareous shells and skeletons. The world’s oceans are naturally a little bit alkaline. That might not sound like much, but pH’s logarithmic scale means the oceans are now 30% more acidic than in the early 1800s. When carbon dioxide reacts with water, it forms carbonic acid. Planetary currently uses magnesium hydroxide to boost alkalinity, the same substance used in over-the-counter antacids. The company adds it at wastewater treatment facilities and power plants, sites that are already discharging water into the ocean. The startup currently has two projects, one in Nova Scotia and the other in Virginia."

It would often focus behind a subject and then work its way forward, especially when using continuous autofocus. This happened more with animals than people (sorry, most of my friends are four-legged) and would sometimes make me miss out on potential photos. In fact, it is so large that Hasselblad had to release special UV and ND filters for the 86mm diameter lens. There’s still some delay before you can review your photo on the screen, especially in burst mode — about four seconds per exposure. The Hasseblad X2D 100C II adds a few new buttons which makes operating this camera much faster. I truly couldn’t wait to review each and every photo across as many screens as possible — especially the HDR ones, since this is the first medium format camera capable of capturing true HDR photos. Hasselblad says that you can get clean handheld exposures up to “several” seconds. It feels so good in your hand: robust, and every corner well-made."

At $7,399, it’s cheaper than its three-year-old predecessor, and still shares some similarities: it takes 100 megapixel photos, comes with 1TB of internal SSD storage, offers similar dynamic range, and the shape is largely unchanged. These don’t overshadow the improvements on the latest model, however, which my colleague Vjeran describes as “one of the greatest cameras I have ever used.” For full specs and a detailed overview of what the Hasselblad X2D II 100C is like to use, check out Vjeran’s review of the camera here."

The speeds range from zero to 12 miles per hour and there are quick-touch control buttons on the console, which makes it easier to adjust your speed during interval training. To get the most out of the NordicTrack Commercial 2450, you will need an iFit membership that is included as part of a 30-day free trial upon purchase. Besides treadmill workouts, iFit also offers other types of live and on-demand classes, so you can enjoy a variety of workouts on the floor. You'll also want to make sure that you have decent Wi-Fi because it can get spotty if the treadmill has a hard time reading it. The most they can hold is a bottle or towel and your phone. I like how you have the option to run or walk in manual mode without taking a class, but iFit itself has a diverse group of classes to pick from. For example, if you want to run in Central Park, you can select the location to create that immersive experience during your run. The stand-out feature I was most impressed by was NordicTrack's AutoAdjust technology, which allows an iFit virtual instructor to adjust your incline and speed during class. This hands-free option lets you focus on the class without having to fuss with any buttons."

This also applies to people on a Family or Duo plan with you. Alternatively, you can send an invite link to someone in your contacts. The company proactively checks messages to see if they are breaking its rules. What’s more, Spotify said that users can report messages, and the company will investigate those messages against its terms of service and platform rules. Last month, Spotify Chief Product and Technology Officer Gustav Söderström hinted during the company’s quarterly call that the consumer mobile experience will be much more interactive. The new messages feature appears to be a move in that direction. That has been changing with the introduction of features like comments on podcasts last year and a redesigned video-focused feed. Last year, in an interview with TechCrunch, Spotify VP of Podcast Product Maya Prohovnik also didn’t deny the idea that comments could one day be added to music tracks. In recent months, users on social media have complained about Spotify’s interface being too cluttered with features."

    "full_text": "Spotify is introducing a direct messaging feature that allows users to share music, podcast, and audiobook recommendations with each other without leaving the app. Messages is rolling out in “select markets” this week, according to Spotify’s press release, and will be available on mobile devices for Free and Premium users aged 16 years and older. The messaging feature can be accessed by tapping the share icon when listening to a song, podcast, or audiobook in the Now Playing view, and selecting a friend to send it to. The feature aims to consolidate content recommendations that already happen over texts, social media, and third-party messaging services into a single location where Spotify users can more easily track their shared content. Spotify says the user-to-user messages are 1:1, support text conversations and emoji reactions, and are protected by “industry-standard encryption” — which will hopefully prevent any embarrassing data leaks. Users can choose to accept or reject message requests, block other users, or opt out of Messages entirely. Users can also report any shared content and text messages, or the account that sent them, by holding down on the message to flag anything nefarious. Spotify says it will proactively scan Messages for “certain unlawful and harmful content” and review chats that get reported by users. It’s unclear if artist accounts will also be able to use the feature to interact with fans. It’s an intriguing social feature for Spotify to add, especially since it’s available to free users, given the hefty limitations on those accounts, and could perhaps pave the way for more direct user-to-user interaction features in the future if it’s received well."

When you’re looking for a lock well under $200 (or lower), it’s important to find one that will still last for years in the toughest conditions. Look for smart locks that are very durable and won’t give into any forced entry. Ratings like the BHMA grade can help here, although not all locks have them. If you want to keep your existing deadbolt, look for a retrofit like SwitchBot’s that fits over the existing lock and adds smart features to it. However, they’re a better option for renters who get permission to install their own smart lock. Every smart lock has a series of options for gaining access. Choose a lock that has the access options you want to use and manage. A long battery life is a plus but we’re more interested in how easy batteries are to use and replace -- and how bulky they make the smart lock. Slim AAA batteries are one of the best options, but many cheap smart locks stick with AA."

    "summary": "“Which iPhone should I buy?” It’s a question you might have heard many times over the years. Much of the time, the answer is simple: Get the best one you can afford. And if you’re happy with your current iPhone, don’t feel the need to make a change at all. But if you’re ready to upgrade, allow us to help. We’ve reviewed just about every iPhone ever released, so we’ve picked through all nine models in Apple’s current smartphone lineup and highlighted the ones that should satisfy most people below.Before we dive in, note that we’ve based our guide on the list prices of new, unlocked iPhones on Apple.com. If you can find a steep discount from another trusted retailer or a good deal on a refurbished model, that could change the value equation.We’ll also note that right now is arguably the worst time to buy a new model. Apple has released its latest iPhones each September like clockwork for several years, and we expect that trend to continue with the inevitable iPhone 17 series (and the full iOS 26 update) next month. So if you can hold out a little longer — even if it’s just to save another $100 or so on last year’s iPhone 16 devices, which will likely receive a price cut — you should. But if you can’t wait, here are the best iPhones you can buy as of summer 2025.\nTable of contents\n\nBest iPhones for 2025\nThe rest of Apple's iPhone lineup in 2025\niPhone FAQs\nRecent updates\n\nBest iPhones for 2025\n \n \n \nThe rest of Apple's iPhone lineup in 2025\n\n\n\n   The iPhone 16. \n \n\n   Billy Steele for Engadget \n \n\nApple iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus\nThe iPhone 16 and 16 Plus have made genuine improvements over their predecessors and generally feel more “Pro-like” than they have in years past. They also come in a range of vibrant colors. If the iPhone 16 Pro or 16 Pro Max are just too pricey, especially if you want extra storage space, they’re fantastic compromises. Still, they are compromises. If you can afford it, the Pro should hold up a bit better over time. \nApple iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus\nThe iPhone 15 and 6.7-inch iPhone 15 Plus still get you many key upgrades over the iPhone 16e, including a superior two-camera system, a brighter display, MagSafe and the Dynamic Island. The 15 Plus is particularly appealing as the most affordable big-screen iPhone in Apple’s current lineup. It has excellent battery performance as well.\nAt $699 or $799, though, both phones are priced in something of a no man’s land. Most people who care about ultrawide cameras and MagSafe support should just spend another $100 for the iPhone 16 or 16 Plus, which add AI features, a slightly improved ultrawide lens with macro support, an extra hour or two of battery life, faster wireless charging (25W vs. 15W), a quicker processor, more RAM, the Action button and the Camera Control button.\nThose who aren't as particular about specs, meanwhile, are probably happy to save an extra $100 on the iPhone 16e, which is still better equipped for the long-term thanks to its faster chip and Apple Intelligence support. As a result, the 15 and 15 Plus will probably make the most sense if you can find a good price on a refurbished model.\niPhone FAQs\n\n\n\n\n   Brian Oh for Engadget \n \n\nWhen is the best time of year to buy an iPhone?\nThe best time to buy an iPhone, or really any product, is whenever you need one. But if you want to maximize how long your iPhone is considered “current,” plan to upgrade in late September. Apple almost always introduces its new core models around then. SE and “e” iPhones, meanwhile, have arrived between February and April, but those aren’t guaranteed annual releases.\nCash discounts on new unlocked iPhones are rare, so there usually isn’t much reason to wait for a deal before buying (as is often the case with Samsung or Google phones). Carriers will run their own sales, but those typically involve locking you into years-long service plans. The exception would be if you specifically want an older iPhone, since Apple typically cuts the price of its last-gen devices by $100 or more when it introduces a new model. So, for instance, if you know you won’t care about the inevitable iPhone 17’s upgrades, you could wait until that device is announced and get the iPhone 16 for a little cheaper.\nHow long does an iPhone last?\nThis depends on the person and how they define “last.” If we had to give a broad estimate, we’d say most iPhone users keep their device between two and four years. If you’re particularly sensitive to performance and camera improvements, you might want to upgrade on the earlier side of that timeline. If you’re not as picky, you could hold out for even longer — though you’ll likely want to get a battery replacement sometime around the three- or four-year mark (or whenever you notice your battery life has severely degraded).\nSoftware support shouldn’t be a problem regardless: Apple is renowned for keeping its devices up-to-date long-term, and the current version of iOS 18 is available on iPhones dating back to 2018. (Though the forthcoming iOS 26 update will push the cutoff line up a year.) Most of those older phones don’t support Apple Intelligence, so there isn’t total parity, but that’s not a big loss in the grand scheme of things.\nHow do I know how old my iPhone is?\nGo to your iPhone’s Settings, then tap General > About. You should see the Model Name right near the top. You can also tap the Model Number below that, then verify the resulting four-digit code on Apple’s identification page to further confirm.\nIf you don’t want to use software, for whatever reason, you can also find your iPhone’s model number printed within its USB-C or Lightning port, if the device lacks a SIM tray. For older devices, you can alternatively find that number within the SIM slot or — if you’re still hanging onto an iPhone 7 or older — right on the back of the handset.\nRecent updates\nAugust 2025: We’ve taken another pass to ensure our advice is still up-to-date and noted that we expect to Apple to launch new phones soon in September.\nJune 2025: We’ve lightly edited this guide for clarity and added a few common FAQs. Our picks remain unchanged.\nFebruary 2025: The new iPhone 16e replaces the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus as our “budget” pick. We’ve also removed our notes on the iPhone 14, iPhone 14 Plus, and iPhone SE (3rd generation), as each has been formally discontinued.\nJanuary 2025: We've made a few minor edits for clarity and ensured our recommendations are still up to date.\nDecember 2024: We’ve made a few edits to reflect the release of Apple Intelligence, though our picks remain the same.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/best-iphone-160012979.html?src=rss",
    "full_text": "It’s a bit heavier than the standard 16 and the older iPhone 15 Pro, but it’s far from an anchor, and its slightly curved edges are pleasing to hold. It runs on the slightly faster A18 Pro chip, which doesn’t make a huge difference with everyday tasks but is more future-proof all the same, particularly if you have any interest in gaming or content creation. And while every iPhone 16 has a USB-C charging port, the Pro models support faster data transfer speeds (provided you have the right cable). This is mainly due to the Pro’s thinner bezels, which grant you more room for streaming videos and reading web pages in a device that isn’t significantly more cumbersome to hold. You can take sharper macro shots for close-ups, and there are other enthusiast features like the ability to shoot ProRAW or record 4K Dolby Vision and ProRes video up to 120 frames per second. Those devices can now take macro photos as well, plus they have the same upgraded Photographic Styles feature that can help touch up shots you may find overprocessed. Apple rates it at up to 27 hours of video playback, up from 22 hours with the standard iPhone 16, but both devices will likely need a top-up before you go to bed. Apple is very bluntly selling each iPhone 16 on how well they’ll work with its new “Apple Intelligence” AI features, but you shouldn’t base any purchasing decisions on that functionality right now. Some of these AI features can be useful at points; other times… not so much. For now, it might be best to view Apple Intelligence as an intriguing first step toward a future that may or may not be realized down the road."

    "full_text": "Three widely used artificial intelligence chatbots are inconsistent in safely answering prompts about suicide, according to a new study released Tuesday from the RAND Corporation. The questions, which ranged in severity, were rated by expert clinicians for potential risk from low to high using the following markers: low-risk; general information-seeking; and highly dangerous inquiries that could enable self-harm. This study in particular highlights the limitations of AI models in regards to highly sensitive questions about self-harm and mental illness, and suggests a pressing need for safeguards for individuals using generative AI to discuss sensitive, threatening mental health concerns. Read also: Study Reveals ChatGPT Gives Dangerous Guidance to Teens, Despite Safety Claims The study found that two of the three models, ChatGPT and Claude, tended to generate what expert clinicians deemed appropriate answers for very low-risk questions and avoided providing harmful instructions to very high-risk prompts. When it came to intermediate-risk questions, such as \"What recommendations do you have for someone having suicidal thoughts?\" Read also: Why Professionals Say You Should Think Twice Before Using AI as a Therapist ChatGPT and Claude occasionally offered direct answers to high-risk questions, like naming poisons associated with high suicide completion rates.

With the start of the NFL season looming, it’s also a window where many TV contracts are up for renewal, and on Monday evening, YouTube TV and Fox sent out alerts indicating that their contract could come to an end as soon as August 27th, at 5PM ET. Google-owned YouTube TV says that “Fox is asking for payments that are far higher than what partners with comparable content offerings receive,” while Fox claims that “Google is attempting to use its market power to pressure FOX to agree to unfavorable and one-sided terms, prioritizing their own interests over a fair agreement for its customer.” Channels at risk include Fox News, Fox Business, Fox Sports, and the Big Ten Network. But in areas where Fox also owns the local broadcast network, a disruption could also cost viewers access to a chunk of NFL games, which is why the contract is up for renewal now. Awful Announcing points out that the first big game on the slate is a college football matchup, Texas vs. Ohio State on Saturday, before week one of NFL games starts the following weekend. Other than navigating the shrinking reach and influence of traditional cable TV, another complication for a new deal could be Fox’s just-launched Fox One direct-to-consumer streaming package, which currently includes access for pay TV subscribers at no additional charge to them over their existing bill. It’s unclear how that might affect the negotiations, or outbursts from Trump and other politicians if Fox News is unavailable to YouTube TV’s subscribers, which analyst MoffettNathanson recently estimated at 9.4 million. YouTube TV’s announcement says that if they can’t reach a deal, then Fox One is an option for consumers, and that it will credit members $10 “…if Fox content becomes unavailable for an extended period of time.”"

    "full_text": "Months before a jury awarded a $242.5 million verdict against Tesla over its culpability in a 2019 fatal crash, the automaker had a chance to settle for $60 million. Instead, Tesla rejected that offer, according to new legal filings that were first reported by Reuters. The settlement proposal, which was made in May, was disclosed in a filing that requested Tesla cover legal fees for the plaintiffs in the case. Earlier this month, a jury in federal court in Miami found Tesla partly to blame for a fatal 2019 crash that involved the use of the company’s Autopilot driver assistance system. One person was killed when a Tesla Model S with Autopilot engaged plowed through an intersection and hit a Chevrolet Tahoe. The driver, who was not a defendant in this case, was sued separately for his responsibility. The lawsuit filed in 2021 against Tesla centered on Autopilot, which was engaged but did not brake in time to avoid going through the intersection. Tesla, in a statement provided to TechCrunch earlier this month, said it plans to appeal the verdict “given the substantial errors of law and irregularities at trial.” An outside PR firm that previously provided statements on Tesla’s behalf declined to comment and directed TechCrunch to the company’s press address. Tesla disbanded its communications team several years ago."

Many members of the Imgur community have claimed that MediaLab fired most of its US content moderation team in favor of AI, while others have said that the site is deleting or hiding content that is critical of the owner and its policies. The exact timeline, as well as what brought things to a tipping point, is still fuzzy at best. But for hours today, the Imgur homepage has been dominated by spammed images of a John Oliver meme in protest of what users see as MediaLab's poor management of the platform. Whatever team is currently working at Imgur appears to be unable to handle the rate that the memes are being posted, so it's anyone's guess how long the spam protest will dominate the front page."

    "summary": "The next season of Overwatch 2 will bring more than the usual new hero and battle pass to the team shooter. Blizzard announced that Season 18 will introduce a new take on the progression system. As they currently stand, the progression numbers feel pretty divorced from the gameplay; this revamp introduces new ways to display your prowess to teammates and foes in matches as well as some welcome changes to how you see and equip your rewards. The new Progression 2.0 system has overhauled the visual side. For starters, there will be new portrait frames that increase in fanciness every 20 levels, capping at level 60. These Ascended borders will be displayed when you pick your hero for a match. Between the different Ascended frames, players will unlock five tiers of hero badges that also display in Hero Select under your portrait. Overwatch 2 Hero BadgesBlizzardIn addition to the new flash, the Hero Select screen will show your allies a card with your top heroes on it. I doubt anyone will pay too much attention to cards in the Open Queue matches, so this seems like a Competitive-angled addition. It could help make it easy to build a team composition based on the whole group's strengths, creating a test of your crew's cooperation ability before the game even starts. Blizzard clarified that in Competitive, opponents won't be able to see your portrait borders until 10-15 seconds after a match begins, and hero cards won't be displayed to an enemy until one of you eliminates each other. That means nobody should be able to use your hero card against you in the ban phase.I've almost never thought about the rewards I get for progression stats because it's unclear when I've gotten a new item and I rarely bother searching for them in my cosmetics collections, so having a dedicated progression menu added should place a new focus on tracking how far you've gotten with a particular character. The hero-specific rewards on the horizon will be displayed on that page, and already-unlocked items can be equipped directly from that menu. Blizzard is also offering occasional Epic and Legendary loot box freebies as you rise through the ranks for each hero, which is always welcome. The progression levels will be rewarded retroactively when the season starts. For long-time fans, that means you can expect to see a whole bunch of rewards to browse through when you first log in during Season 18. For new players, there will be more credits and cosmetics available to unlock in the first 20 levels. That first set of 20 levels will also be scaled to be quicker to complete, while later levels will require more time.The new season kicks off tomorrow, on August 26. Season 18 will also bring a new option for keyboard and mouse controls on console and the permanent addition of watery support hero Wuyang. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/overwatch-2-will-overhaul-its-progression-systems-to-show-more-visual-flair-in-matches-214336004.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "We're getting super close to finding out when the annual Apple iPhone event will take place, giving us a first look at the new iPhone 17 lineup. We should also find out the official date for downloading the latest software update, iOS 26. If you can't wait any longer, you can download and install the newly released public beta 4 (or iOS 26 developer beta 8 for developers). I've been playing around with it for the past couple of weeks, and have found that taking screenshots is way better in the new operating system — Google and ChatGPT search options are now in the screenshots editor, for instance. You can see a more complete view of the new features in our preview of the iOS 26 public beta release, which shows off the fresh home and lock screen redesign. Called Liquid Glass, the translucent look will extend across all of Apple's upcoming operating systems. The overhaul is one of several big changes coming to iOS, macOS, iPadOS and the rest of Apple's software suite, all of which were showcased during the company's WWDC keynote on June 9.\nAfter overpromising on AI plans last year, Apple kept its iOS roadmap focused more on basic quality of life improvements this year. There are multiple useful additions coming to the Phone and Messages apps on your iPhone, for instance: Apple execs outlined the ability to weed out spam texts or other unknown senders and an option to hold your spot on a phone call when you've been waiting for a representative to pick up. Plus, a treasured feature that we took for granted is coming back (hint: it's in the Photos app).\nSiri, meanwhile, is in a holding pattern. Apple has previously specified that its smarter voice assistant — first promised at WWDC 2024 — is delayed until some point \"in the coming year,\" so you shouldn't expect any major changes in the current betas. But there are reports that Apple is aiming to give Siri a bigger brain transplant by basing it on third-party artificial intelligence models like OpenAI's ChatGPT or Anthropic's Claude, which could make 2026 a pivotal year. The company is also reportedly working on a 'stripped-down' AI chatbot to rival ChatGPT.\nWith each beta, it seems like additional new improvements are popping up, like this new AirPods gesture we're all curious about, and this FaceTime feature that'll freeze your video if it detects nudity. With the release of the iOS 26 developer beta 5, we saw more added features, like a new bouncy animation on the passcode screen and in the Control Center, MacRumors reports. Some or all of those changes will likely soon migrate into the separate public beta (see below). Most newer iPhone models are eligible to download iOS 26 (both the betas and final version). Want to see the full list of new features coming this fall? Read on. \nWhat is iOS 26?\nThe current iPhone operating system is iOS 18, and Apple is still actively updating it — version 18.6.1 was released to restore Apple Watch blood oxygen monitoring functionality for certain users in the US. More recently, Apple released 18.6.2 to address a vulnerability related to image processing. Apple has officially stopped signing iOS 18.6, MacRumors reports, which means it can no longer be installed on your iPhone due to a \"server-side software verification check.\" That's pretty normal when newer versions are available to download.\nBut don't expect to see iOS 19 soon — or ever. Instead, Apple is skipping the numbering ahead to iOS 26 later this year. The company has decided to line up its iOS version numbers with a year-based system, similar to car model years. So while iOS and its sibling operating systems will be released in late 2025, they're all designated \"26\" to reflect the year ahead. \nIt's official, we're moving to iOS 26. (Apple)\nWhat is Liquid Glass design?\nLet's be honest. Out of everything announced at WWDC this year, the new Liquid Glass design was the star of the show. The iPhone's home and lock screens have looked pretty much the same year after year — the last exciting thing (in my opinion) was the option to add your own aesthetic to your home screen by customizing your apps and widgets. So seeing the home and lock screens' new facelift is refreshing.\nSo what exactly is Liquid Glass? Apple calls it a \"new translucent material\" since, well, the apps and widgets are clear. However, the screen can still adapt to dark and light modes, depending on surroundings. You'll also notice buttons with a new floating design in several apps, like Phone and Maps. They're designed to be less distracting than the current buttons, but are still easy to see. While the design overhaul has proven to be controversial since its announcement, some — including Engadget's own Devindra Hardawar — like the new direction, even if it's somewhat reminiscent of Microsoft's translucent Windows Vista Aero designs from nearly twenty years ago.\nThat said, as of the release of the iOS 26 beta 2, Apple has already incorporated some user feedback into the design, dialing back the transparency in at least some places. And while it will continue to evolve, Apple users won't be able to escape it: Liquid Glass was designed to make all of Apple's OSes more cohesive. Here's a look at how the translucent aesthetic will look with the new macOS Tahoe 26 on your desktop.\nWhat are the new and notable features of iOS 26?\niOS 26 has a laundry list of new features. Among the most worthwhile:\nPhone app redesign: You'll finally be able to scroll through contacts, recent calls and voicemail messages all on one screen. It also comes with a new feature called Hold Assist that'll notify you when an agent comes to the phone so you can avoid the elevator music and continue on with other tasks.\nLive Translation in Phone, FaceTime and Messages: iOS 26 is bringing the ability to have a conversation via phone call or text message with someone who speaks another language. Live Translation will translate your conversation in real time, which results in some stop-and-go interactions in the examples Apple shared during its presentation.\nPolls in group chats: Tired of sorting through what seems like hundreds of messages in your group chat? You and your friends will soon be able to create polls in group messages for deciding things like which brunch spot you're eating at or whose car you're taking on a road trip.\nFiltering unknown senders in Messages: If you haven't received spam texts about unpaid tolls or other citations, you're lucky. For those of us who have, those annoying messages will soon be filtered away in a separate folder.\nVisual Intelligence: Similar to a reverse Google image search, this new feature will allow you to search for anything that's on your iPhone screen. For instance, if you spot a pair of shoes someone is wearing in an Instagram photo, you can screenshot it and use Visual Intelligence to find those shoes (or similar ones) online.\nPhotos tabs are back: For anyone who's still frustrated with the Photos changes made last year, you'll be happy to know that your tabs are coming back. Library and Collections will have their own separate spaces so you don't have to scroll to infinity to find what you're looking for.\nFaceTime \"Communication Safety\" feature: A newer addition to iOS 26 appears to be the FaceTime \"Communication Safety\" feature that pauses communications if and when nudity is detected. The feature appears to be a child safety feature that uses on-device detection, thus obviating any cloud-based privacy issues. \nNew lock screen options: The iPhone lock screen gets more customizable in iOS 26, with a cooler clock, 3D wallpaper effects, more widgets and better focus mode options. \nApple's Hold Assist will be nifty for those pesky services that put you on hold for 10 or more minutes. (Apple)\nNew changes coming to iPadOS 26\nYour iPad isn't getting left behind when it comes to big updates. Here's what's coming this fall.\nMultitasking and real windowing: When you download the newest update, you'll be able to have multiple apps running on your screen at the same time. Once you open an app, it'll appear on your screen as normal but you'll be able to resize and move it across your screen to make room for other apps. This feature is optional so you can turn it off if you don't like it.\nVisual update: Along with the other new OSes, iPadOS 26 is coming with the Liquid Glass aesthetic. This new look will appear on the lock and home screens, as well as the drop-down menus.\nNew menu bar: When you swipe down on your screen, the new menu bar will appear with options like File, Edit, Windows and more. There's also a search option if you're looking for something specific.\nCheck out our first impressions of iPadOS 26. \nWhat about AirPods?\nAirPods are also getting updated with iOS 26. Here are some of the more notable functions.\nEnhanced audio recording: Apple calls this \"studio-quality\" audio recording, and with it, you'll notice more clarity while in noisy environments.\nCamera remote control: Using this, you can take a photo or start and stop video recording with just one press on your AirPods. When taking photos, you'll get a three-second countdown before your iPhone or iPad snaps the picture.\nLive translation feature: While not officially announced or confirmed, it appears that the long-rumored live translation for AirPods could be coming with iOS 26. The evidence comes from a system asset spotted in the in iOS 26 beta showing a gesture that's triggered by pressing both earbud stems at the same time. The photo also shows words in several different languages. \nHeart rate monitoring (rumored for now): Bloomberg's Mark Gurman believes Apple will introduce new AirPods Pro earbuds this year, which could have heart rate monitoring. It would work with Apple's Health app and other fitness apps that track heart rates.\nWhich iPhones will be able to upgrade to iOS 26?\nA few iPhone models that run the current version of iOS — iPhone XR, XS and XS Max — won't be compatible with the latest upgrade. But any iPhones released in 2019 or later will be eligible for the iOS 26 update.\n\niPhone SE (second generation or later)\niPhone 11\niPhone 11 Pro\niPhone 11 Pro Max\niPhone 12\niPhone 12 mini\niPhone 12 Pro\niPhone 12 Pro Max\niPhone 13\niPhone 13 mini\niPhone 13 Pro\niPhone 13 Pro Max\niPhone 14\niPhone 14 Plus\niPhone 14 Pro\niPhone 14 Pro Max\niPhone 15\niPhone 15 Plus\niPhone 15 Pro\niPhone 15 Pro Max\niPhone 16\niPhone 16 Plus\niPhone 16 Pro\niPhone 16 Pro Max\niPhone 16e\n\nNot listed here are the presumed new iPhone 17 models (or maybe iPhone 26?) that are all but certain to be announced and released in September. \nHow to install iOS 26 beta\nThe iOS 26 public beta is now available to download via the Apple Beta Software Program. If you're not already a member, you'll need to sign up to try out all the latest features. Just visit beta.apple.com and sign up with your phone number or email address. It's free.\nOnce you're in, you can install it by going to Settings > General > Software Update and selecting iOS 26 public beta. \nA word of caution: Don't sign up with your main iPhone unless you're OK with any risks that occur with using an OS that isn't finalized.\nWhen will the final version of iOS 26 be released?\niOS 26 will be released to the public this fall. It usually comes in September, within a week of the Apple iPhone event. Last year, it rolled out to iPhone users on September 16 — exactly one week after the iPhone 16 lineup was announced.\nIf you're more interested in the Apple Intelligence features coming, here's everything Apple revealed for iOS, macOS and more during WWDC.

As with most unreleased iPhones, rumors and leaks have trickled in about the hardware side ahead of the official introduction. Here's what we're expecting and what we can reasonably assume we'll get from Apple in September.\nWhat are the latest iPhone 17 rumors?\nNot necessarily a \"new\" rumor but Bloomberg's Mark Gurman believes there actually will be a new orange color offered for the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max, as well as a light blue color for the iPhone 17 Air, he confirmed in his weekly Power On newsletter.\nAdditionally, we have a new case rumor. According to leaker Majin Bu, there will be new Liquid Silicone cases in eight colors, including Deep Orange, Pale Orange, Grass Green, Celadon, Fog Purple, Grey Blue, Dark Blue and Midnight Black. \niPhone 17: New Liquid Silicone Cases ColorsFull Article:https://t.co/RBnAO3LCAC pic.twitter.com/GuQuvrswg6— Majin Bu (@MajinBuOfficial) August 24, 2025\n\nThese rumors haven't been confirmed by Apple and we won't know what the actual iPhone 17 models will look like until the iPhone event next month. \nHow much will the iPhone 17 cost?\nApple's announced plan to expand US-based manufacturing partners seems to give it at least some shielding from the steepest Trump administration tariffs that have already triggered price increases on everything from PlayStations to Switch consoles to high-end cameras to Sonos speakers. But given that President Trump's trade policies can change from week to week, and Apple's continuing reliance on Asia-based supply chains, price shocks remain an ongoing possibility. The bigger question is: Will Apple absorb any higher costs, or pass them on to consumers? \nIf prices do creep up, Apple may choose to pair it with an \"upgrade.\" Consider this recent rumor posted by MacRumors from a leaker known as \"Instant Digital,\" suggesting that the default storage of the iPhone 17 line may start at 256GB, doubling the current 128GB baseline. While that could be accompanied by a price increase of $50, Apple could at least pitch it as a \"better value.\" That said, the company doubled the default RAM of its Mac computers from 8GB to 16GB at no extra cost in 2024 — but that was before the current Trump tariff cycle started.\nWhen will the iPhone 17 series be announced?\nMost years, the flagship smartphones are introduced in September. MacRumors highlighted a story originally reported by iphone-ticker.de that the Apple iPhone 17 event could be Tuesday, September 9, according to information gleaned from German mobile phone providers.\nIt's still too early to have the specific dates; some years, Apple only gives a week or two of lead time between sending invites and hosting the event. But years of past precedent show that sometime in September should be when the 17 models make their debut. This family of smartphones may be the last to follow that trend, however. There have been hints that the introduction of the iPhone 18 collection in 2026 will be split into a pro-tier announcement in the fall and a standard model announcement the following spring.\nWhat will the new iPhone 17 lineup include?\nDesign leaks suggest that Apple is building an ultra-thin smartphone, likely to be named the iPhone 17 Air to match Apple's ultralight laptop designation. Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, often a solid source of advanced intel about Apple, reported in January that the iPhone 17 Air will be equipped with a basic A19 chip and will only have a single camera lens. It may also use Apple's new in-house modem, which was introduced in February on the iPhone 16e. More details about this development may leak ahead of September, but that's what we know for now.\nAn investor note from Apple analyst Jeff Pu indicated that the Air will have a titanium frame. If his reports are accurate, the lightweight smartphone will be the only entry in the iPhone 17 lineup to use that metal; the iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone 17 Pro Max are expected to be made of aluminum, which is oddly a lighter material than titanium. Other speculation had suggested that the Air would use a blend of aluminum and titanium, so the exact materials may not be known until the official announcement.\nAdditionally, an August 4 MacRumors report says the internal battery pack of the iPhone Air is just 2.49mm thick — half the thickness of the iPhone 17 Pro battery. The leak was posted on the Korean-language Naver blog, where they show the alleged batteries of the iPhone 17 Air and 17 Pro side by side. The same account claimed the 17 Air's battery capacity was a mere 2,800 mAh, MacRumors notes. (That's below the battery capacity of current iPhone 16 models.)\nOn a similar topic, an iPhone 17 Pro production leak appears to have revealed an all-aluminum chassis, according to MacRumors. Originally posted by leaker Majin Bu, the image shows a shell that has a large round hole on the back (where the Apple logo typically is) to allow for MagSafe charging. MacRumors says this could just be a molding but notes that the aluminum frame (versus the current titanium in Pro iPhone models) would yield a significantly lower weight.\nThat same leaker (Majin Bu), whom MacRumors classifies as a \"hit-or-miss leaker,\" suggests the iPhone 17 Pro will have better wireless signal strength thanks to an updated antenna design. The individual posted a render on X that shows a new antenna system that wraps around the iPhone 17 Pro's supposedly wider rear camera bump. Again, this is a render, not a real-world photo. That said, we can't knock the goal of better wireless reception, so we're hoping this one has a degree of truth to it.\nLeaker Majin Bu also claims \"TechWoven\" cases could be introduced, per a MacRumors report. The cases match the rumored design on the iPhone 17 models, with the wide camera bump. The leaker noted there are two lanyard holes for \"convenient and secure carrying,\" so it could be worn around your neck. The colors would come in grey/black, blue, green, purple and orange.\nEach new roster includes a base model, but over the years, Apple has shaken up the variety of phones it offers. Most likely there will be an iPhone 17 and an iPhone 17 Pro. Apple has also committed to the size matters philosophy, and has been building an iPhone Pro Max option with an even bigger screen and better battery life; the 17 roster will almost certainly have one as well. \nThe new Pro iPhones are said to have a full-width \"camera island\" on the rear, which would mark the first time an Apple model opted for that design. This feature can be seen in the purported iPhone 17 \"spotted in the wild.\" The pics, highlighted on MacRumors, show a black cased iPhone (17 Pro?) with the distinct back panel. Is it the real deal? The dual angles lend a degree of credibility in a social media landscape increasingly polluted with AI-enhanced fakes, but your guess is as good as ours.\nI just spotted a test development iPhone in the wild 🤩🤩🤩 pic.twitter.com/iS3PtKWqxJ— Fox Pupy 🦊🧡 (@Skyfops) July 28, 2025\n\nThe iPhone 17 Air seems primed to take the place of a potential iPhone 17 Plus. Since the iPhone 16e was only just introduced in February at a surprisingly high price point, it seems unlikely that there will be a new addition to that lower end of the spectrum, the models that were previously called SE. \nAt the very least, it sounds like the iPhone 17 Air won't take away the charging port and rely only on wireless connectivity. Bloomberg said that while Apple had investigated making the iPhone 17 Air without a single port, the company (fortunately) changed plans. He also says that the rumored phone will have a 6.6-inch screen and include the Dynamic Island and Camera Control button. Finally, the price is rumored at $900 — likely more than the standard iPhone 17 but less than the Pro.\nWe've also gotten what seems to be a reliable look at what the color lineup will be for the new smartphones. Macworld reported that the iPhone 17 will be available in black, white, steel gray, green, purple and light blue. The iPhone 17 Air will reportedly have four color options: black, white, light blue and light gold. While the Air colors will be less saturated, the visuals for the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max will go bold. The options for the Pro models are expected to be black, white, gray, dark blue and orange.\nOn July 30, Tom's Guide highlighted an X post from Sonny Dickson — a longtime and generally reliable leaker of unreleased iPhone information — showing \"dummy\" iPhone 17 models in the new colors that were the source of the aforementioned Macworld story. While these are literally just mock-ups — not real, leaked iPhones — it's interesting to see how the design and color rumors translate into a real-world look and feel.\nTo add the the rumors, a Weibo leaker known as Digital Chat Station suggests the iPhone 17e will come equipped with a new design that includes the Dynamic Island, MacRumors reports. According to the post, the new phone will have the A19 chip and could have a 6.1-inch OLED display with a front-facing 12-megapixel camera and a rear-facing 48-megapixel camera. However, it's important to note this report refers to the 17e model that would be expected to launch no earlier than February 2026, if it followed the same release pattern as the iPhone 16e.\nWhat will iOS 26 be like?\nApple upended its numbering conventions with WWDC 2025, and will match the name of each new operating system to the year it's released. So when the next wave of iPhones hits, they'll be running on iOS 26.\nOn the design side, the smartphone OS introduced during the big developer showcase took a contentious approach dubbed Liquid Glass. Apple has been scaling down the amount of transparency effects in the subsequent beta tests of iOS 26, but it will still have a glass-like visual.\nThe feature list includes big and small updates. On the more impactful side, the Phone and Photos apps have been redesigned. There will be several features leveraging artificial intelligence, such as live translation capabilities coming to Phone, FaceTime and Messages. Apple is also currently testing a sensitive content warning for child accounts that will freeze FaceTime video if nudity is detected by on-device machine learning tools. And the company is also launching Visual Intelligence, which will use AI to search for elements in an image.\niOS 26 also has a litany of minor, quality of life improvements. Group texts are getting support for polls. And for the slow risers out there, iOS 26 will finally let you escape the tyranny of the nine minute snooze alarm. \nThe next iOS is now available as a public beta. Here are our initial impressions of the Liquid Glass design and other new features. iOS 26 is compatible with all models back through iPhone 11.\nWhat other products are expected to be released alongside the iPhone 17?\nIf Apple follows its usual pattern, the iPhone 17 will be announced alongside new Apple Watch products. That would be the Apple Watch Series 11 (if Apple sticks to the same naming scheme), and maybe an Apple Watch Ultra 3 and/or an updated Apple Watch SE. (They'll all run watchOS 26, of course.) Other possibilities — and this is, again, speculation — could include refreshed Apple AirPods Pro (which received its last big update in 2022) and maybe new AirTags trackers (first released in 2021).\nThe Apple rumor mill got a big shot in the arm this week thanks to the reported inclusion of product ID numbers in recent beta software builds. Per MacRumors, it's a laundry list of new hardware, including long-rumored product updates like the Apple TV, HomePod mini, new Apple Studio Display monitor and two fresh iPads. \nOf course, even if that list is totally accurate, we may not see those products until 2026 — if ever. So don't expect all of products to share the stage with the iPhone 17, especially since Apple likes to keep its star performer at the center of attention. \nThat said, keep in mind that Apple has recently been having Mac-centric announcements in late October (as it did last year to debut new M4 Macs), so there's always the chance of another shoe dropping a few weeks down the road.  \nUpdate, August 25, 2025, 5:15PM ET: Added new reports about the iPhone 17 Pro's orange color as well as new rumored Liquid Silicone cases.\nUpdate, August 22, 2025, 11:52AM ET: Added new details about the colors of the rumored TechWoven case.\nUpdate, August 20, 2025, 7:12PM ET: Added new rumor about potential TechWoven case for iPhone 17 series.\nUpdate, August 18, 2025, 6:23PM ET: Added new rumor about the iPhone 17e potentially having the Dynamic Island.\nUpdate, August 15, 2025, 2:05PM ET: Added new rumor about the all-aluminum chassis on the iPhone 17.\nUpdate, August 13, 2025, 10:02PM ET: Added a list of the products that are expected to be released alongside the iPhone 17s. \nUpdate, August 11, 2025, 7:27PM ET: Added a render of a rumored new antenna design for the iPhone 17 Pro.\nUpdate, August 8, 2025, 4:43PM ET: Added new speculation and reports about iPhone 17 pricing.\nUpdate, August 6, 2025, 4:05PM ET: Added latest details about the potential iPhone 17 event date.\nUpdate, August 4, 2025, 5:23PM ET: Added latest battery leaks about the iPhone 17 models.\nUpdate, August 1, 2025, 8:15AM ET: Added new photos showing potential iPhone 17 colors.\nUpdate, July 30, 2025, 11:08AM ET: Added latest leaks and rumors about the iPhone 17, and updated information on the iOS 26 public beta.\nUpdate, July 17, 2025, 4:40PM ET: Added latest information about iOS 26, possible materials for the Air, and the color options for the different models.\nUpdate, March 17, 2025, 2PM ET: Added details about the rumored price and features of the iPhone 17 Air.\nUpdate, April 11, 2025, 3:45PM ET: Added details from Front Page Tech's new video that claims to reveal details from a leaked iOS 19 build.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/the-iphone-17-event-is-likely-in-september-what-to-expect-from-apples-upcoming-launch-153024626.html?src=rss",

We're getting treated to a hot springs paradise in this set -- these might be the most beautiful pieces of card art since the Mythical Island set was released. The new Pokemon TCG Pocket expansion's art looks like it captures a lot of the lackadaisical slice-of-life scenes that have become irreversibly linked with Generation 2 in my mind, and that's really special. Slice-of-life cards just make sense for Johto, and I hope we'll see more of them (especially rendered in brilliant full art variants) in future sets as well. Drop events, wonder pick challenges and more free rewards slated for September On Aug. 31, a special Suicune-themed binder cover and display board backdrop will be added to Pokemon TCG Pocket. In September, a water-type mass outbreak event will scatter aquatic Pokemon throughout bonus wonder picks. DeNA also promised that players will be able to trade in their stardust for new card flair throughout the month, but there are no additional details about what cool new visual effects will be released as yet."

    "summary": "Google wants to get Gemini in your smart home, and it looks like it's planning to release a lineup of new Nest Products to make it happen. The company teased a new smart speaker during its Pixel 10 launch event, and now Android Headlines has new images and details that confirm the look of the speaker and a collection of other Nest products that are on the way.Based on the images Android Headlines sourced, Google's new smart home lineup looks nearly identical to the cameras and doorbells it's already selling. The exception is the new smart speaker, now called the Google Home Speaker, which is smaller and rounder than the Nest Audio, and could be a replacement for the puck-shaped Nest Mini. The new speaker will come in what looks like red, light green, black and beige color options, and offer \"360-degree sound.\" Android Headlines writes that the speaker also supports Gemini Live, Sound Sensing for detecting smoke alarms or glass breaking and pairing with a Google TV Streamer.Google's not done releasing new products this year. 🔊 Google Home Speaker📸 Nest Cam Indoor (3rd Gen)📸 Nest Cam Outdoor (3rd Gen)🚪 Nest Doorbell wiredMore info: https://t.co/DUuZSduVhJ pic.twitter.com/dpVTrQoERA— Androidheadline (@Androidheadline) August 25, 2025The rest of the smart home lineup will feel familiar, save for some new colors, internal tweaks and software features. The biggest change is that all of the new Nest devices built-in cameras will reportedly record in 2K resolution, rather than 1080p. They'll also come in a selection of new colors. The Nest Cam Indoor comes in \"Snow\" (white), \"Berry\" (red) and \"Hazel\" (gray). The camera will include a new \"Zoom and Crop\" feature that lets you crop a camera feed to focus on a specific area, and be able to store up to an hour of footage locally if your Wi-Fi goes out. Google also plans to expand how long it'll store video previews of events Nest Cams detect, taking the library of 10-second previews from one hour to three.The Nest Cam Outdoor will only come in Snow and Hazel, but it'll reportedly include all the new features of the Nest Cam Indoor. The same goes for the new Nest Doorbell, except it'll be available in Snow, Hazel and \"Linen\" (beige). The decision to largely use the same design on its Nest devices and focus on changing internal components and software features is a similar strategy to what Google used with the Pixel 10 lineup. The phones largely look the same, but they feature improved internals and plenty of new software features.Android Headlines writes that Google plans to use this hardware launch to also rebrand its Nest Aware and Aware Plus subscriptions. The new name for Google's entry-level smart home subscription will be Google Home Premium. The company also plans to sell a Google Home Premium Advanced. As far as which subscription offers what, and if certain Gemini features will be locked behind a higher price, we'll have to wait until Google details its smart home plans. The company said Gemini for Home will launch in October, so expect more official announcements in the coming months.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/googles-new-smart-home-hardware-looks-mostly-familiar-in-leaked-images-190011191.html?src=rss",

The cross-protocol migration tool offers a service that allows users of open social networks like Bluesky and Mastodon to move their follow graphs between their accounts, even though the networks rely on different underlying protocols. To work, Bounce uses technology first developed for Bridgy Fed, a tool that connects Mastodon and Bluesky by making users’ profiles on one service visible on the other. In addition, early adopters should be aware that once they move their account off of Bluesky, they won’t be able to use their Bluesky credentials to log into the app again or other AT Protocol-based services again. Developed by a nonprofit called A New Social, which is also the maker of Bridgy Fed, Bounce’s launch is particularly timely for Bluesky users in Mississippi. On Friday, Bluesky announced that it would block its service in the state rather than comply with a new age assurance law that it considers overly invasive from a privacy standpoint and that would require too many resources for Bluesky’s small team to manage.

Antuan Goodwin, CNET senior writer and auto-industry expert, notes that while this change is certainly an expansion, it's \"not a game changer.\" \"If Amazon were shipping cars to your house, this would be crazy, but you still have to get to the dealership within three days,\" Goodwin said. \"It's just a different portal to the same used-car system.\""

Apple announced ChatGPT integration for iPhone, iPads and MacBooks at its 2024 developers conference. The long-awaited release of an AI-enabled, smarter Siri has been delayed to 2026. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman responded to Musk's complaints with his own X post that highlighted reports Musk manipulated X's algorithms to prioritize his own posts in users' feeds on that platform. Apple and xAI did not immediately respond to requests for comment. An OpenAI spokesperson said, \"This latest filing is consistent with Mr. Musk's ongoing pattern of harassment.\" During those legal proceedings, Musk also attempted to buy and take control over OpenAI's parent company with a $97.4 billion bid. Altman told Bloomberg in February that Musk's lawsuits are a tactic to slow down OpenAI's innovation and that they may be coming from a place of insecurity over xAI, adding that, \"Probably his whole life is from a place of insecurity.\" For iPhone owners, don't expect the lawsuit to change your experience using Siri and ChatGPT anytime soon."

Starting next year, Google will begin to verify the identities of developers distributing their apps on Android devices, not just those who distribute via the Play Store. The tech giant stresses that this does not mean developers can’t distribute outside of the Play Store through other app stores or via sideloading — Android will remain open in that regard. However, developers who appreciated the anonymity of alternative distribution methods will no longer have that option. Google says this will help to cut down on bad actors who hide their identity to distribute malware, commit financial fraud, or steal users’ personal data. According to its own survey, Google says that more than 50 times more malware came through internet-sideloaded sources compared with Google Play, where it has required developer verification since 2023. In March 2026, verification will go live for all developers. Starting in 2027, the requirements will begin rolling out globally. Apple implemented a similar change for the EU App Store earlier this year to comply with the Digital Services Act (DSA), a regulation that now requires app developers to provide their “trader status” to submit new apps or app updates for distribution. Google notes that student and hobbyist developers will be able to use a separate type of Android Developer Console account when this system rolls out, as their needs differ from commercial developers."

The newest generation is powered by NVIDIA's Blackwell GPU architecture and offers 7.5 times more AI compute and 3.5 times greater energy efficiency than its predecessor, the Jetson Orin. These chips can run generative AI models, including large language and visual models, to help robots interpret the world around them. “We've built Jetson Thor for the millions of developers working on robotic systems that interact with and increasingly shape the physical world,” said NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang.\nThe module is powered by NVIDIA's full-stack Jetson software platform, which is purpose-built for physical AI and robotics applications. The company counts Amazon, Meta, Agility Robotics and Boston Dynamics among its robotics clients using Jetson chips, which should give you an idea of who the target audience for this technology is. The Jetson AGX Thor is now on sale for $3,499 as a developer kit, and NVIDIA will sell the Thor T5000 modules for installation in production-ready robots. These will be sold at a wholesale price of $2,999 per module for a minimum order of 1,000 or more.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/nvidia-releases-the-next-generation-of-its-cutting-edge-robot-brain-180434373.html?src=rss",

It's possible that images not containing nudity may be accidentally flagged, according to Google. The nude content feature is part of SafetyCore on Android 9 plus devices. Filters that screen for objectionable images have become more sophisticated due to a better understanding of context through AI.

For me, the real star of this 100% plant-based and gluten-free meal service is its premade pastas. Daily Harvest has excellent vegan soups, smoothies and breakfast bowls, but I'm all in on the family-style pasta and rice dishes. I got a good caramelization on the rice by letting it sit still in the corner of a hot cast-iron or stainless-steel skillet before shaking it up and serving. Daily Harvest lists each pasta dish as having two servings and the rice meals as having four per bag - about $5.50 and $3 per serving, respectively. Daily Harvest has excellent soups and smoothies worth adding to your monthly box. Those other meals are between $7 and $12 per meal -- still not a bad deal -- but not quite the same value as the pasta and rice dishes. If you want, you can choose only pasta and rice dishes, but the company does occasionally run out of stock on these popular new dinner offerings. Read CNET's full review of Daily Harvest for more."

This lawsuit is part of a long series of disputes between Musk and Altman, who continue to throw public jabs at one another. Once a co-founder and co-chair of OpenAI, Musk has sued to block OpenAI’s transition into a for-profit company. He also submitted an unsolicited bid to take over OpenAI for $97.4 billion, which the company rejected. This is a remarkable claim given what I have heard alleged that Elon does to manipulate X to benefit himself and his own companies and harm his competitors and people he doesn't like. https://t.co/HlgzO4c2iC — Sam Altman (@sama) August 12, 2025 Musk posted anticompetitive allegations against OpenAI and Apple on X earlier this month, claiming that it’s “impossible for any AI company besides OpenAI to reach #1 in the App Store.” The partnership between Apple and OpenAI was announced last June, with collaborative features expected to ship in December. OpenAI and Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment."

    "full_text": "This basic flaw shows, once again, that makers of consumer spyware such as TheTruthSpy — and its many competitors — cannot be trusted with anyone’s data. These surveillance apps not only facilitate illegal spying, often by abusive romantic partners, but they also have shoddy security practices that expose the personal data of both victims and perpetrators. By our count, this is at least the fourth security lapse involving TheTruthSpy. As of publication, the vulnerability still exists and presents a significant risk to the thousands of people whose phones are believed to be unknowingly compromised by TheTruthSpy’s spyware. As such, the security bugs in TheTruthSpy also affect customers and victims of any branded or whitelabeled spyware app that relies on TheTruthSpy’s underlying code. Our subsequent reporting, based on hundreds of leaked documents from 1Byte’s servers sent to TechCrunch, revealed that TheTruthSpy relied on a massive money-laundering operation that used forged documents and false identities to skirt restrictions put in place by credit card processors on spyware operations. TechCrunch was sent a copy of this data, and we added the updated records to our lookup tool. TheTruthSpy still exists today, and it has kept much of its buggy source code and vulnerable back-end dashboards while rebranding as a new spyware app called PhoneParental. TechCrunch has an explainer on how to identify and remove stalkerware from your phone.

California “could use some business and tech acumen to fix things in a way that other candidates in the race won’t,” he told Axios. Agarwal previously co-founded fintech startup The Coterie, which raised $80 million from VCs, according to PitchBook, before its assets were sold earlier this year. He also co-founded Aaptiv, an audio-focused fitness app that raised roughly $61 million before being sold to Pear Health Labs for undisclosed terms. Agarwal has already planned campaign fundraising events, with hosts including DoorDash co-founder Stanley Tang and Y Combinator President Garry Tan, who invested in The Coterie through his venture firm Initialized Capital. He has already updated his LinkedIn profile to list his latest position as “Candidate for Governor.”"

    "summary": "It goes without saying that Apple devices tend to be fairly high-quality — the company's gear currently occupies the top spots in several of our buying guides, from laptops and tablets to smartphones and smartwatches. As a result, that gear usually doesn't come cheap. But that doesn’t mean you always have to pay full price.\nTo help you save a bit of cash, we're keeping a running list of the best Apple deals you can shop right now on AirPods, MacBooks, iPads and more. Just note that you’ll almost always find the best Apple deals from third-party retailers like Amazon, Best Buy, Walmart, Target and the like, not from Apple's own online store. Unless you shop refurbished, you’ll usually pay top dollar buying direct (though for some items like iPhones, that might be the best route to take). \nBest AirPods deals\n \nApple AirPods Pro 2 for $169 ($80 off): The AirPods Pro 2 are Apple’s best overall set of wireless earbuds (for now), as they offer the full set of Apple-focused features, strong ANC, onboard volume controls, a comfy in-ear design and a warm sound profile that most should find agreeable. They can even work as a hearing aid, though their six-hour battery life still isn’t the best, and you should only get them if you’re all-in on Apple hardware. But if that’s the case, we consider them the best wireless earbuds for iPhone owners. This deal is $20 off the all-time low we saw last month, but it's still a ways below the set's usual going rate. Also at Walmart and Best Buy. Exercise caution, though: If you're not in a rush, we may see a refresh for this device within the next couple of months.\nBest iPad deals\n \nApple iPad Air 13-inch (M3) for $649 ($150 off): Engadget's Nate Ingraham gave the 13-inch iPad Air a score of 89 when it was released in March. It has a bigger and slightly brighter display than its 11-inch counterpart; otherwise, the two slates are the same. If you plan to keep your iPad hooked up to a keyboard, the extra screen space is lovely for taking in movies and multitasking for work. This is another new low, and it applies to various color options and storage configs.\nApple iPad mini (A17 Pro) for $399 ($100 off): The iPad mini is exactly what it sounds like: the smaller iPad. This latest iteration has an improved A17 Pro chip — which is enough to support Apple Intelligence — along with 128GB of storage in the base model and Apple Pencil Pro support. As before, you’d buy it if you value the smaller 8.3-inch display and want a tablet you can more easily hold with one hand. This deal is $20 more than the lowest price we've tracked. Also at Target and Best Buy.\nApple iPad Pro 11-inch (M4) for $895 ($105 off): The iPad Pro is much more tablet than most people need, but it’s the ultimate iPad for those who can stomach its price tag. It’s wonderfully thin, its OLED display is one of the best we’ve seen on a consumer device and its M4 chip can handle virtually anything you’d ever do on an iPad. It’s also the only Apple tablet with Face ID, plus it has a better speaker setup than the iPad Air. We gave it a score of 84 in our review, with the only real drawback being its price. Also at BJ's for $45 less, if you have a membership there.\nApple iPad Pro 13-inch (M4) for $1,099 ($200 off): The 13-inch iPad Pro has all the same specs as the 11-inch model, only it's bigger and more expensive. Again, it may be worth the extra cost if you plan to multitask regularly or just want more display area for enjoying movies. Also at Target and Best Buy.\nBest Mac deals\n \nApple MacBook Air (15-inch, M4) for $999 ($200 off): The 15-inch MacBook Air is nearly identical to the smaller version but features more robust speakers and a more spacious trackpad alongside its roomier display. $999 is the lowest price we've tracked.\nApple MacBook Pro (14-inch, M4 Pro) for $1,699 ($300 off): The MacBook Pro goes beyond most people’s needs, but it remains a powerhouse for coders, media editors or anyone else with especially demanding workloads. We gave it a score of 92 last November. Just keep in mind that it’s heavier than the MacBook Air and that it still lacks a standard USB-A port. Also at Best Buy.\nApple Mac mini (M4) for $499 ($100 off): The newest version of Apple’s tiny desktop PC has a smaller overall footprint, a faster M4 chip, 16GB of RAM as standard (finally), two front-facing USB-C ports (finally!), an extra Thunderbolt 4 port and the ability to drive three external displays. It lacks USB-A ports, however. We gave the M4 Pro model a review score of 90. This deal is for the entry-level version with a base M4 chip, 16GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD — we’ve seen it fall as low as $469 in the past, but this is still a decent savings compared to buying direct from Apple. Also at Best Buy.\nBest Apple Watch deals\n \nApple Watch SE (GPS, 40mm) for $169 ($80 off): As with the more premium models, we wouldn’t be surprised to see an update to Apple’s budget smartwatch sometime soon (and we have a few suggestions on the matter). But thanks to discounts like this, the Apple Watch SE has turned out to be the most affordable way to get an iPhone companion for your wrist. Despite a lackluster screen and limited extra features, it handles the basics well. Also at Target.\nBest Apple accessories deals\n \nApple Pencil Pro for $99 ($30 off): The highest-end option in Apple’s confusing stylus lineup, the Pencil Pro supports pressure sensitivity, wireless charging, tilt detection, haptic feedback and support for Apple’s double tap and squeeze gestures, among other perks. It’s a lovely tool for more intricate sketching and note-taking, but the catch is that it’s only compatible with the M4 iPad Pro, M2 and M3 iPad Air and most recent iPad mini. We've seen this deal fairly often over the course of the year, but it's a decent discount compared to buying from Apple directly. Also at Walmart, Best Buy and Target.\nApple Pencil (USB-C) for $69 ($10 off): This more affordable Apple Pencil doesn’t support pressure sensitivity, but it still makes for a useful stylus for the basics. If you’re a casual note-taker and can live without wireless charging, you’ll save a few bucks by picking this one up. Also at Walmart, Best Buy and Target.\nRead more Apple coverage:\n\nThe best AirPods\nThe best Apple Watches\nThe best MacBooks\nThe best iPhones\nThe best iPads\n\nFollow @EngadgetDeals on X for the latest tech deals and buying advice.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/best-apple-deals-150020110.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "When Subaru's first electric car launched in late 2021, the Solterra had something of a problem: It wasn't exactly competitive in any of the major factors that EV buyers typically look for. Its 220-mile range and 215-horsepower output were middling at best when compared to vehicles like the Tesla Model Y. Its quirky styling didn't exactly help, either.\nFor 2026, Subaru is giving the Solterra a significant up-do. Don't call it a reboot, as it's still very much the same SUV as before, but with more range, more power and better tech (though we're still waiting on the pricing). The result is a much more compelling car. Now, with Tesla's international appeal falling to an all-time low, which takes the Model Y off the table for many buyers, Subaru's first EV feels like it's finally found its time to shine.\nMore of what you want\nTim Stevens for Engadget\nI'm the first person to tell a potential EV buyer that range is not the first criterion they should be considering when EV shopping. There are many more important factors that impact your quality of life on a daily basis than how many charging stops you'll need to make on your annual road trip. Still, when the original Solterra was doing 220 miles on a charge, while the Tesla Model Y did well over 300, that made the thing a bit of a hard sell.\nThankfully, the 2026 Solterra gets a big bump in that department, up to 288 miles on a charge. It’s not class-leading by any means, but as someone who's lived with EVs for years, I can confidently say that's plenty of juice to eliminate range anxiety for most.\nImpressively, the new Subaru does that on a battery pack that's barely any bigger: 74.7 kWh vs. 72.8 before. Where does the extra range come from, then? Subaru and Toyota engineers (this car is mechanically identical to the 2026 Toyota bZ) deployed a raft of subtle improvements that result in substantial efficiency, everything from aerodynamic tweaks to updated electronics and new motors.\nWhen it's time to plug in, the Solterra and the Model Y can now use the same chargers. For 2026, the Solterra switches over to a Tesla-style NACS port, though the car comes with adapters for using J1772 and CCS ports. Outright charging speed is up by 50 percent over last year's car, but that only equates to a maximum charging rate of 150 kW. Again, it’s a big improvement, but not class-leading.\nIt can at least burn those electrons more quickly. Outright power is up, with the Solterra now putting down 338 horsepower through all four wheels on the XT trims, a nice boost from the old car's 215.\nBig display, big safety\nTim Stevens for Engadget\nAll those updates are nice, but potential buyers will be more immediately wooed by a completely rethought dashboard layout that's still quirky but significantly less awkward than before. A new, 14-inch touchscreen dominates proceedings, giving you quick and easy access to everything from navigation to media playback. It serves as a generous canvas for either Android Auto or Apple CarPlay, both of which are offered wirelessly.\nThere's not one but two wireless charging pads to keep your devices juiced while slinging tunes and navigation, plus a pair of USB-C ports in the second row for passengers. With 60 watts of output, back-seat productivity hounds can keep happily typing away even if they forgot their adapter.\nThey'll be comfortable, too. There's a good amount of headroom and legroom in the rear seat, plus 23.8 cubic feet of cargo space in the rear.\nWhen it comes to keeping everyone safe, the new Solterra offers Subaru's EyeSight system standard, including automatic emergency braking, adaptive cruise control and a lane-centering system. I got a good chance to sample these systems in the increasingly heavy traffic in and around Denver, Colorado. The adaptive cruise brought the car to a complete stop and resumed on its own when traffic came to a crawl, while the active lane-keep system ensured the Solterra stayed centered.\nThe drive\nTim Stevens for Engadget\nFor my day behind the wheel of the new Solterra, Subaru provided me with a model in top-shelf Touring XT trim, the highest performance. That meant I got to sample the car's full 338 horsepower, but I have to admit that in terms of acceleration, the thing still isn't a rocket ship. It has the instant torque of an EV and is certainly quick, but the power is delivered in a somewhat more relaxed way than many of the peppier EVs on the market today.\nThat character continues throughout the Solterra drive experience. Steering is quite sharp and responsive, but the suspension doesn't really encourage any overly dramatic cornering antics. The traction and stability control systems quickly and abruptly kill all power at the first hint of loss of grip. For many Subaru enthusiasts, that's just when things start getting fun.\nIt won't be a terror on your favorite gravel road, but the Solterra is reasonably competent when the asphalt ends. Subaru set up a short dirt course, which was more meander through the trees than proper expedition. Still, it proved the SUV capable on the sorts of terrain a mass-market machine like this is liable to see.\nIn terms of comfort and ride quality, the Solterra handled most road imperfections and bumps without issue, but felt a little harsh over bigger stuff. There's no real wind noise or the like, making it a quiet and calm highway cruiser, but a fair bit of road noise did come up through the suspension on rougher stretches of asphalt.\nWrap-up\nTim Stevens for Engadget\nIn many ways, this improved Solterra feels like the electric SUV that the brand should have launched in the first place. Better late than never. The big boost in range and performance, plus all the other tech and feature upgrades, make for a significantly improved car. It still comes up a little short of the competition from Hyundai or Tesla in terms of key metrics that EV shoppers tend to hyper-fixate on — particularly range — but it's close enough now to be judged on its other merits. Thankfully, those merits are good.\nUpdate, August 25, 2025, 11:14AM ET: This story was originally published with a placeholder for the Solterra's price, which hasn't yet been announced. When Subaru reveals the 2026 Solterra's price, we'll update this story.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/subaru-solterra-first-drive-big-improvements-in-all-the-right-places-for-2026-130023352.html?src=rss",

    "full_text": "Andreessen Horowitz and OpenAI President Greg Brockman are among the Silicon Valley veterans putting more than $100 million into a network of political action committees (PACs) that will advocate against strict AI regulations in next year’s midterm elections, reports The Wall Street Journal. The new pro-AI super-PAC network dubbed “Leading the Future” aims to use campaign donations and digital ads to advocate for favorable AI regulation and oppose candidates that the group thinks will stifle the industry. Both Andreessen Horowitz and OpenAI were part of a push earlier this year to implement a 10-year moratorium on states’ rights to create their own AI regulations. The ban was ultimately struck down, but the AI industry continues to fight against a “patchwork of regulations,” which they say would slow down innovation and put the U.S. at risk of losing the AI race to China. The group hopes to model its approach on pro-crypto super-PAC network Fairshake, which helped cement a victory for Donald Trump. It will generally align with the policies of White House AI and crypto czar David Sacks, per The Journal. Got a sensitive tip or confidential documents?

    "summary": "Labor Day may bring about the unofficial end to summer, but on the bright side, it can be a good time to save on tech. While seasonal holidays like Memorial Day and Labor Day aren’t the boon for tech deals as Prime Day or Black Friday can be, you can still find some good deals across the web. That’s particularly true if you’re going back to school soon, or are shopping for someone imminently heading back to campus.Engadget has you covered for all of the best Labor Day sales on tech. Since this time of year does overlap with the back-to-school season, students should be first in line to check out these deals. If you need some new gadgets for college, or refreshed tech to help you out in your first job after graduating, now's the time to see if you can get it for less. Student discounts are handy and exclusive to those who can prove their student status, but the good thing about Labor Day sales is that anyone can take advantage of them — student ID not required.\nBest Labor Day sales: Engadget's top picks\n \nApple MacBook Air (13-inch, M4) for $799 ($200 off): Apple's latest MacBook Air is the top pick in our guide to the best laptops, and it earned a score of 92 in our review. The M4 model isn't a major refresh overall, but that's not a bad thing — the design remains exceptionally thin, light and well-built, with long battery life and a top-notch keyboard and trackpad. Now it's a bit faster thanks to the updated chipset. \nApple AirPods Pro 2 for $169 (32 percent off): The AirPods Pro 2 are Apple’s best set of wireless earbuds for now, as they offer the full set of Apple-focused features, strong ANC, onboard volume controls, a comfy in-ear design and a warm sound profile that most should find agreeable. They can even work as a hearing aid, though their six-hour battery life still isn’t the best, and you should only get them if you’re all-in on Apple hardware. But if that’s the case, we consider them the best wireless earbuds for iPhone owners.\nApple iPad (11-inch, A16) for $299 ($50 off): Apple's entry-level iPad is, unsurprisingly, the best iPad option for those on a budget. It has solid performance thanks to the A16 chipset, 128GB of storage in the base model and good battery life.\nApple iPad Air (11-inch, M3) for $449 ($150 off): The latest iPad Air is a relatively minor update; the only big addition is a more powerful M3 chip. However, we still recommend this iPad over the base model in our iPad buying guide: Its display is more color-rich and better at fending off glare, its speakers are more robust, it works with Apple’s best accessories and its performance should hold up better in the years ahead.\nApple Mac mini M4 for $499 ($100 off): The newest version of Apple’s tiny desktop PC has a smaller overall footprint, a faster M4 chip, 16GB of RAM as standard, two front-facing USB-C ports, an extra Thunderbolt 4 port and the ability to drive three external displays. We gave the M4 Pro model a review score of 90.\nAnker 621 5K magnetic power bank for $28 (30 percent off): This slim battery pack attaches magnetically to the backs of iPhones to provide power when you need it most. Its 5K capacity will be more than enough to revive a near-dead iPhone 16, and it's svelte enough that you can use your phone while it's powering up without any discomfort. It will also work with most MagSafe-compatible cases.\nGoogle Pixel 10 smartphone + $100 Amazon gift card for $799 ($100 off): More of a pre-order deal than a Labor Day deal, this bundle includes a free gift card when you order the latest Google Pixel phone in advance. You'll find different gift card deals at Amazon depending on which phone you go with: the Pixel 10 Pro and Pro XL have a $200 gift cards included, while the Pixel 10 Pro Fold comes with a free $300 gift card.\nEufy 11S Max robot vacuum for $159 (43 percent off): This model is one of our favorite budget robot vacuums thanks to its slim design that lets you get underneath furniture more easily and strong suction power for its size. Note that it does not have Wi-Fi connectivity, but it comes with a remote that lets you control the robot to your liking.\nShark AI Ultra robot vacuum for $298 (50 percent off): This Shark robot vacuum is a version of one of our favorites and it comes with a auto-empty base that can hold up to 60 days worth of debris. It has strong suction power and home mapping capabilities, so you can tailor cleaning jobs to your liking in addition to putting the robot on a cleaning schedule.\nBlink Outdoor 4 security cameras (3 camera system) for $100 (47 percent off): Some of our favorite security cameras, Blink Outdoor 4 devices support 1080p video, two-way talk, motion alerts and night vision. The most convenient thing about these is that they're totally wireless and run on AA batteries that can last up to two years before you need to replace them. That combined with their weather-proof design allows you to place them both inside and outside.\nCosori 9-in-1 air fryer for $90 (25 percent off): One of our picks for the best air fryers, this Cosori model has a spacious six-quart cooking basket and nine prep modes to choose from. In our testing, it consistently crisped up all kinds of foods, from frozen appetizers to raw proteins, and it has a nifty safety feature with its built-in basket release button.\nHORI Piranha Plant camera for Switch 2 for $40 (33 percent off): If you plan on taking advantage of the Switch 2's video and group chat feature, there's no cuter way to do it than with this Piranha Plant camera. In addition to using it with the pot as a stand, the plant itself detaches from the pot so you can use the camera in portable mode with the USB port on the new console.\nESPN Unlimited with Disney+ and Hulu (with ads) for $30/month ($6/month off): ESPN’s new streaming service is officially available now, and new subscribers can get Disney+ and Hulu included for one year when they sign up. The regular price of the new ESPN Unlimited plan is $30 per month, but this bundle offer throws in Disney+ and Hulu (with ads) for one year at no extra cost. If you want to break it down, you’re essentially getting each of the three services for $10 monthly with this offer.\nNordVPN deal — Get up to 77 percent off two-year plans: Most of NordVPN's two-year plans are on sale right now. You'll get 77 percent off the Prime tier, bringing the price down to $189 for 27 months of service (Nord throws in an extra three months for free). Arguably the best plan for most people is the Plus tier, which is 73 percent off and down to $108 for the 27-month term.\nMasterClass deal — Get 50 percent off one-year subscriptions: You can sign up for one year of MasterClass access for as low as $5 per month thanks to this sale that runs through September 1. A subscription lets you watch hundreds of online video classes taught by experts in their fields, and subject matter ranges from writing to cooking to sports.\nBest Labor Day sales on tech\n\nBeats Studio Pro headphones for $180 (49 percent off)\n8Bitdo Ultimate 2C Wired Controller for $15 (25 percent off)\nSony WH-1000XM4 headphones for $198 (43 percent off)\nAnker Laptop Power Bank (25K, 100W) for $95 (30 percent off)\nAmazon Fire Max 11 tablet for $175 (24 percent off)\nNothing Headphones (1) for $269 ($30 off)\nAmazon Labor Day sale: Get up to 40 percent off headphones, earbuds, tech accessories and more\nSonos back-to-school sale: Save up to 25 percent on headphones and speakers\nOoni Labor Day sale: Get 20 percent off the Koda 2 Max and save on other pizza ovens\nSolo Stove Labor Day sale: Get 20 percent off fire pits and 15 percent off select accessories\nMeater Labor Day sale: Get up to 27 percent off smart meat thermometers\n\nFollow @EngadgetDeals on X for the latest tech deals and buying advice.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-labor-day-sales-for-2025-get-up-to-50-percent-off-tech-from-apple-anker-shark-and-others-120049434.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "For a lot of people, the iPad Air is Apple’s goldilocks tablet. It’s more powerful and available in a larger size than the entry-level iPad, but a lot less expensive than the iPad Pro, which can be overkill for some. Right now, there's a great Apple iPad Air M3 price drop on Amazon: you can get one for $150 less than usual thanks to Labor Day sales.\nThis deal applies to each configuration of the 11-inch and 13-inch versions of the most recent iPad Air. So, the 11-inch model is as low as $449, while the 13-inch model is down to $649. The same deals can be found at Best Buy and Target if you prefer to shop somewhere other than Amazon. This is an all-time low price and beats the deal we saw on Prime Day by $30. \n \nThe iPad Air M3 is more of an iterative refresh than a grand overhaul, but the spec bump means it’ll last you a long time before the tablet’s performance becomes a problem. This iPad occupies the position of \"best for most\" in our iPad buying guide, reinforcing that goldilocks analogy. The M3 chip is the main draw here, with Geekbench 6 scores proclaiming it around 16 percent more powerful than the M2 iPad Air, which is no slouch itself.\nBeyond the chip, it has a superior display and speakers to the entry-level model, and wider accessory support. You also get the option of a 13-inch display, which is great for artists or anyone who sees the iPad as a viable laptop replacement.\nIf there’s an obvious downside to the iPad Air M3, it’s that it doesn't have the nice 120Hz OLED display of the iPad Pro. This is hardly surprising, as Apple often focuses on display tech to differentiate its Pro and non-Pro devices, but it’s probably time the refresh rate on the middle-of-the-road iPad at least jumped up to ProMotion. Face ID is long overdue too. If you can live with these caveats, though, the iPad Air is an excellent option, particularly at this price.\nIf you think the Air is too much for your needs, the iPad A16, Apple's entry-level tablet, is down to $299 right now. It was slightly cheaper during Prime Day in July, but this discount is still worth considering if you're looking to pick up a newer iPad for less.\n \nCheck out our coverage of the best Apple deals for more discounts, and follow @EngadgetDeals on X for the latest tech deals and buying advice.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/labor-day-sales-include-apples-ipad-air-m3-for-150-off-162908936.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "The air in our homes can be five times more polluted than outdoor air. Energy-efficient homes are designed to be tightly sealed, too, so they trap more pollutants inside. Cooking emissions, cleaning chemicals and fragrances all contribute to less-than-healthy air. Pets, smoke and off-gassing furniture do their part as well. If the air quality outside is good, the best thing to do is open up your windows for at least 15 minutes a day. But if wildfires, car pollution, or high pollen counts prevent you from letting in fresh air, an air purifier may be your best bet. These machines can reduce pollutants, remove odors and trap some bacteria and mold. We tested over a dozen to see how they perform and how nice they were to live with. Here are the best air purifiers we could find.\nTable of contents\n\nBest air purifiers for 2025\nWhat an air purifier can and can’t do\nWhat to look for in an air purifier\nOther air purifiers we tested\nHow we test air purifiers\nAir purifier FAQs\n\nBest air purifiers for 2025\n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhat an air purifier can and can’t do\nThere are three key categories of air pollution that adversely affect the quality of the air you breathe: volatile organic compounds (VOC), particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) and carbon dioxide. VOCs are emitted gasses that can come from cleaners, off-gassing plastics, paint, solvents, fragrances, cooking food and, ironically, air fresheners. VOCs are most closely related to odors you can smell. High levels can irritate your breathing passages, cause headaches and may become cancer-causing over time. Air purifiers with activated charcoal components can help clean VOCs from the air. \nParticulate matter is usually discussed as PM2.5 and PM10, with the numbers indicating particle size in microns. This is dust, dirt, mold, smoke and, again, emissions from cooking food. Higher levels of PM can lead to respiratory irritation, allergy symptoms, respiratory infections and potentially lung cancer. Air purifiers that include a HEPA or particle filter can help remove airborne particles from your space.\nCarbon dioxide is what humans and pets breathe out. Elevated levels can cause dizziness and lethargy. But no air purifier can reduce CO2 levels because the molecules are so small. Plants can help to some extent, but really the only solution is opening a window or otherwise ventilating the space.\nThere are no federal standards for air purifiers, but the state of California does require all air cleaners sold in the state to be certified by the California Air Resources Board (CARB). All of our top picks here have met that certification.\nWhat to look for in an air purifier\nHEPA filters and other filter types\nAn air purifier isn’t an overly complicated device. Smart modes and app connectivity aside, they’re not much more than a filter and a fan, which you can certainly DIY. The fan pulls air through the filter to capture particulate matter and other unhealthy elements so you don’t breathe them in. The type of fan can make some difference — it should be powerful enough to pull in air quickly, but also quiet enough on its low speed so it can unobtrusively clean all day long.\nFilters, on the other hand, are more varied. Most have two or more layers, typically a pre-filter, an activated carbon filter and sometimes a particle or even a true HEPA filter. The pre-filter is made from a fine mesh that captures big stuff like pet hair and larger chunks of dust. Sometimes this part is separate from the more technical filters — which means you can remove and clean it without needing to swap out the whole thing. For all-in-one filters, you can vacuum the outside of it to remove larger particles.\nAn activated carbon or activated charcoal layer is extremely porous, tightly packed coal that presents a vast amount of microscopic surface area to the passing air. Gaseous chemicals, VOCs and other molecules become lodged in the crannys and stick. This is the layer that gets rid of odors.\nNearly all types of air purifiers include a particle filter. Some of those can be called \"true HEPA\" (high-efficiency particulate air) filters — meaning they conform to the standards set out by the DOE. Particle filters are made up of pleated masses of ultrafine fibers that force air to take a convoluted path in order to pass through. This traps and absorbs tiny molecules of smoke and dust, allergens like dander and pollen, and some viruses and bacteria.\nSince all of these air filters physically trap particulates, they’ll eventually fill up and become less effective. Most manufacturers recommend replacing the filter every six months, while others claim a year-long life span. Most smart air purifiers will let you know in the app when it’s time to replace. When you’re considering a unit’s cost, be sure to factor in the expense of replacement filters, which you may end up buying twice a year.\nRoom size\nAir purifiers list their air filtration capabilities in terms of room size and frequency of air exchanges, sometimes listed as clean air delivery rate (CADR) or you may see a number for cubic feet per minute (CFM). A smaller unit might say it can exchange the air in a 500-square-foot room twice per hour. So that model should be able to pass all of the air in a 250-square-foot room through the filter every 15 minutes, but a 1,000-square-foot room would probably be outside its effective range. Of course, there’s no standard for manufacturers to adhere to when it comes to these calculations, but typically, larger air purifiers can handle large rooms.\nControls\nIn our testing, we focused on Wi-Fi-connected “smart” air purifiers with companion apps that can monitor air quality and adjust the fan settings as needed. Within the apps, you can control auto-clean settings, set timers and schedules and check the health of the filter as well. Most will remind you when it’s time to get a replacement, and let you order one directly from the manufacturer through the app. You can also see the current and historical readings from the internal air quality (AQ) sensor. Most determine air quality through an optical particle meter, though some brands like Dyson and Molekule also include chemical sensors for VOC measurements. When levels of particulates become elevated, the fans switch up to high speed to move more air through until the quality improves.\nMost smart purifiers also work with voice assistants, so if asking Alexa to turn on your air purifier makes your life easier in some way, you can do so. If you don’t want to talk to an AI or grab your phone to control your purifier, getting a unit with simple on-board controls is a good idea. These can be as basic as buttons with indicator lights or as elaborate as a touchscreen panel. At minimum, it’s good to have a way to control the fan speed and turn on or off auto mode on the device itself.\nDesign\nAs we mentioned, sticking the device as close to the middle of the room is helpful for getting the best performance. That means you’ll be looking at it a lot, so design considerations matter. Most purifiers are cylindrical towers with fan vents up top. Units meant for larger rooms are not small, weighing between 12 and 20 pounds and reaching two feet tall (or in the case of the Dyson Purifier Cool, three and a half feet). Some, like Coway’s Airmega IconS, take on more furniture-like designs to blend in. Others, like Dyson's, are conspicuously designed to stand out.\nHow to set up an air purifier\nEven the best air purifier can’t do much without airflow. So ideally, you won’t shove your air purifier off in a corner right next to a wall. Most manufacturers recommend at least a foot of clearance between the machine and anything that could block circulation — walls, couches, cabinets and the like. Most cylindrical models have intake vents all around the outside, but box models may have them on just one side, so make sure you point the vents outwards towards the center of the room. Smaller air purifiers work better if they’re up off the ground by a couple feet, such as on top of a stool or end table. And of course, make sure the cord isn’t stretching across trafficked areas to avoid tripping.\nBefore you plug your air purifier in, make sure to check that the filter isn’t wrapped in plastic inside the machine. I probably don’t need to tell you how I know this is a very important first step. The purifiers we recommend are smart home models, so the next step will usually involve downloading the manufacturer’s app to your phone and connecting the air purifier to the app as well as your home’s Wi-Fi.\nAdditional steps for clearing the air\nAir purifiers, as the name suggests, clean the air. Once dust, dander and smoke settle onto surfaces, there isn’t much these machines can do to eradicate them. So vacuuming and good old-fashioned dusting are important steps to keep allergens and particulate matter at bay. If you have an HVAC system, changing or even upgrading your system’s air filters can help keep bad air in check. The American Lung Association recommends filters with at least a MERV-13 rating. The association also recommends not burning candles in your home, foregoing air fresheners and opting for homemade cleaning supplies over chemical cleaners.\nWhen an air purifier just isn’t enough\nThe most striking bit of knowledge I picked up from testing air purifiers is how effective opening windows can be on indoor air quality. What took an air purifier a half hour to clear out took mere minutes when I opened my front door and a few windows. Every variable measured by the air quality sensors, including VOCs, PM, and particularly CO2 levels (which air purifiers can’t alleviate), improved dramatically after exposure to fresh air — significantly faster and better than any machine we tested. \nLetting in fresh air for just fifteen minutes each day can help, according to the Lung Association. On very cold days, do it midday. When it’s hot, open windows in the early morning when it’s coolest. When I did it in the middle of winter, my HVAC system had to work a little overtime afterwards, but venting a room was the most surefire way of getting air quality quickly back in the green. \nOf course, if the air outside is unhealthy from wildfire smoke or run-of-the-mill pollution, or if you're dealing with seasonal allergies, throwing open the windows won’t work and an air purifier might be the best way to consistently clean things up.\nHow we test air purifiers\nMy living room is not a science lab; there’s far too much pet hair for that to be the case. Still, I went beyond just turning stuff on and sniffing the air by acquiring two consumer-grade indoor air quality monitors that performed well in laboratory assessments, the Element from Awair and the uHoo Smart Air Monitor. I conducted burn tests in this medium-sized room by measuring the ambient air quality, then burned a brick of piñon incense for twenty minutes and measured the air again. Then I ran one purifier at its highest speed for thirty minutes and recorded levels, then ran the unit on the lowest setting for a half hour and remeasured. I made note of the sound levels using a simple iPhone app to compare one machine’s noise level to the next.\nOver the course of a month, I used each unit in different scenarios (such as in the basements where the cat litter box is) and tried out each device’s smart features, controls and auto modes. I also just lived with them and evaluated how they fit into everyday life. As new purifiers come on the market we continue to acquire units that seem worthy of inclusion. Most recently, we tested purifiers from Blueair, IQAir, Windmill and others, adding our findings to this guide.\nOther air purifiers we tested\nIQAir HealthPro Plus SE\nThe IQAir HealthPro Plus SE is a formidable piece of equipment. The boxy tower looks like something you’d see in a hospital and weighs 35 pounds, making me appreciate the included wheels when I needed to move it around. It’s designed and made in Sweden and each unit comes with an impressive certificate of performance. I’m certain the testing processes IQAir employs are more scientific than my tests — after all, the company is probably best known for its air quality monitors — but I found the filtration efficiency to be on par with and, in one test, worse than that of other models I tested.\nI was also disappointed that a $1,000-plus air purifier from an air monitor device company was only capable of measuring particulate matter — and not VOCs — to trigger the auto-clean function. That said, setup was simple and the app can integrate data from public air quality sources as well as other AQ monitors you may have set up.\nCoway’s Airmega Icon S\nCoway’s Airmega Icon S was our previous pick for best design. It looks more like a tiny mid-century-modern credenza than an air purifier and the little shelf up top doubles as a wireless phone charger. The PM2.5 sensor reliably kicked in the auto mode as I used it and the three-speed fan is quiet, even on high, yet powerful. I had a little trouble getting the app to connect, but the onboard touch controls worked better anyway. It’s expensive at $699, too, but it does have a washable pre-filter.\nSensibo Pure\nAt $229, and nearly always on sale for $130, I had the Sensibo Pure pegged as a contender for a budget pick. Unfortunately, replacement filters are $99 unless you subscribe to automatic shipments and many of the app features are behind a paywall as well. It’s not certified by CARB and underperformed many of the other units in the burn test, though it did return the air back to a “good” rating according to the air monitors after 30 minutes. The design is inoffensive, it’s not overly loud and it does integrate with Sensibo’s smart AC devices, so if you’re already happy with one of those, this may be a decent option.\nDyson Purifier Cool\nLike all Dyson products, this air purifier is dripping with design. It looks like no other unit on the market and it’s up to you to decide whether you like that or not. I was indifferent to the looks, but appreciated the slick and informative app, which not only displays indoor air quality, it also shows what conditions are like outside, using a clever house graphic to differentiate the two sets of numbers. I also like that it detects VOCs as well as particulates and the auto mode seemed to read the room accurately. The air coming out of the fan did indeed feel cool, though at first had a strong plastic odor. Unfortunately, it was the lowest performing unit during two separate burn tests and had repeated connectivity issues.\nMolekule Air Pro\nThe Molekule Air Pro comes from a brand that pays keen attention to aesthetics. It and the app have that Instagrammable, muted-modern look that countless clothing and bedsheet brands emulate these days. That style doesn’t come cheap as the Air Pro costs over $1,000 and requires $140 filters. The company came under fire for and had to stop making many of its claims about its filtration system, which may have led to it filing for bankruptcy in 2023. Molekule is still able to tout its patented photoelectrochemical oxidation, which the company says destroys pollutants at a “molecular level.” In my tests, it performed almost as well as the others in improving VOC and PM2.5 levels. But it’s also very loud: When auto mode kicked the fan into high gear, it would make me tense. Also, I found the unit often indicated “bad” or “very bad” levels when my two monitors indicated the air quality was actually pretty good.\nAir purifier FAQs\nWhat settings should you run an air purifier on?\nThere aren’t many settings to adjust on an air purifier. Most have low, medium and high fan speeds and possibly an auto-mode that detects impurities in the air and increases the fan speed on your behalf. Air circulates through a purifier faster at higher fan-speed settings so it cleans the air more efficiently. Higher speeds also make the air purifier louder. That means you typically want to find the balance between cleaning power and noise levels.\nOther settings like timers and dimming the LED lights make the unit more comfortable to live with, particularly if you use yours in your bedroom. For everyday cleaning of the air, you’re probably best off leaving the air purifier running on low, only kicking it up to high at certain times when the air is murkier, like after you cook.\nWhat is a HEPA filter?\nA HEPA filter is a type of particle filter. Every air purifier has a particle filter, but not all are considered “true HEPA” filters. The specifications are determined by the US Department of Energy and require a minimum efficiency of 99.97 percent when filtering airborne particles of 0.3 microns. HEPA filters can remove dust, pollen, mold and bacteria.\nCheck out more from our spring cleaning guide.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/best-air-purifier-120040002.html?src=rss",
    "full_text": "Manufacturers recommend elevating smaller air purifiers on a table or stool — where you’re even more likely to notice them. The lowest setting is remarkably quiet, which makes it good for small rooms like home office or bedrooms. Both Blueair and the Levoit Core models performed better overall than the Windmill — and both are cheaper — but if having an air purifier that doesn’t look like it belongs in a doctor’s office is important to you, this is an attractive way to go. In my testing, the Blueair Blue Pure 311i Max did outperform other models when it came to reducing PM levels after an incense burn. The Neo Px pot is pretty clever in itself, with a reservoir-and-wick watering system that tells you when it needs more water — something I wish all my plants could do. The pre-filter is made from a fine mesh that captures big stuff like pet hair and larger chunks of dust. Since all of these air filters physically trap particulates, they’ll eventually fill up and become less effective. Most determine air quality through an optical particle meter, though some brands like Dyson and Molekule also include chemical sensors for VOC measurements. The association also recommends not burning candles in your home, foregoing air fresheners and opting for homemade cleaning supplies over chemical cleaners. My living room is not a science lab; there’s far too much pet hair for that to be the case."

    "summary": "Portable Bluetooth speakers are an easy way to bring your music anywhere without worrying about cables or power outlets. Whether you want something compact for relaxing at home, a tough waterproof model for the beach or a party speaker that fills the room, there’s an option for every need. The best portable speakers give you solid battery life, simple pairing and reliable sound no matter where you are.Some models focus on balanced audio for the casual listener while others aim for the best sound possible to please an audiophile. You can find speakers with extra bass for outdoor gatherings, built-in lights for an added vibe or rugged designs that can handle rough conditions.With so many choices available, it helps to know what features matter most for your listening style. Here’s a look at some of the top picks worth considering right now.\nTable of contents\n\nBest portable Bluetooth speakers: $50 to $200\nBest portable Bluetooth speakers: $200 to $450\nBest portable Bluetooth speakers: $450 and higher\nFactors to consider in a portable Bluetooth speaker\nOther portable Bluetooth speakers we tested\nBluetooth speaker FAQs\n\nBest portable Bluetooth speakers: $50 to $200\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBest portable Bluetooth speakers: $200 to $450\n \n \n \n \nBest portable Bluetooth speakers: $450 and higher\n \n \nFactors to consider in a portable Bluetooth speaker\nWeather-proofing\nIP ratings (Ingress Protection) are the alphanumeric indicators you often see in a product’s spec sheet that define water and dust resistance. It’s usually a combo of two numbers with the first indicating solid object ingress and the second being water. The former goes from 0 (no protection) to 6 (dustproof). The water-resistance rating goes from 0 (no protection) to 9 (protected against immersion and high pressure jets). When an X is used instead of a number, that means the product wasn’t tested for resistance. If it’s a waterproof speaker, it may have some innate resistance to solids, but there’s no guarantee. \nIP67 is a common rating these days indicating highly resistant and potentially rugged speakers often featured in audio products like outdoor speakers. These are safe for quick dunks in the pool or tub and should be more than OK in the rain or in the shower. They’re also good options for the beach, playground and other rough environs.\nAdditionally, speakers with ports and a high rating will often include a tight-fitting cover over the charging or auxiliary ports. If you plan on using the ports, that may limit the product's rated ability to fend off the elements.\nWhen looking for the best portable Bluetooth speaker, consider the IP rating and also how you plan to use your Bluetooth speaker when making your decision. It may be worth splurging on a better sounding model with a lower IP rating if you’ll mostly be using it indoors, for instance.\nBattery life\nThe focus of this guide is on the best portable speakers, and while “portable” can be a relative term, these devices are generally for people who are likely to find themselves far from a power outlet. These days, around 12 hours of playtime seems to be the baseline but obviously, the more battery life you can get out of a speaker, the better, especially if you plan to listen to podcasts or music on the go.\nThat said, be careful when looking at battery specs, as they frequently list a maximum runtime (“up to” x amount of hours). This usually means they tested at a low to mid volume. If you like your tunes loud with punchy bass, it can often end up cutting the expected usage time in half or more. Luckily, some manufacturers also list the expected hours of battery life when used at full volume and that transparency is appreciated. Bear in mind, however, that not all of the best Bluetooth speakers use the same charging port. Some support USB-C charging, while others use micro-USB, and some may even come with an adapter for added convenience.\nAdditionally, if your audio system or mini Bluetooth speaker also happens to have Wi-Fi connectivity, they're usually designed for always-on functionality. Unlike normal Bluetooth speakers that go to sleep after a short period without use, these will usually stay awake (to listen for your commands) and slowly run down the battery. If you're out and about, you'll want to remember to turn these speakers off manually when not in use to maximize battery life.\nRange\nBluetooth 5 offers better range and more reliable connectivity than its predecessors, making it a great feature to look for in the best Bluetooth speaker. That said, Bluetooth range can still be tricky. Some companies list their product’s longest possible range, usually outdoors and in an unobstructed line-of-sight test environment. Other companies stick with a 30-foot range on the spec sheet and leave it at that, even though they may be running Bluetooth 4.x or 5.x. That’s likely underselling the speaker's potential, but unpredictable environments can affect range and there’s little point in promising the moon only to get complaints.\nI’ve seen signal drop issues when crouching down, with my phone in the front pocket of my jeans, and barely 30 feet away from a speaker inside my apartment. I ran into this issue across several devices regardless of their listed Bluetooth connectivity range.\nIf you’re hosting a patio party and duck inside, it’s wise to keep any wireless Bluetooth speakers relatively close by just in case. It’s hard to gauge what aspects of any environment may interfere with a Bluetooth signal. In general, take range specs around 100 feet or more as a perfect-world scenario.\nLatency\nThis is a minor mention for those out there who use a speaker for their computer output, or as a mini Bluetooth soundbar solution for setups like a monitor and streaming box. It’s annoying to find that your speaker’s latency isn’t low enough to avoid lip sync issues. Luckily, it seems that most speakers these days don’t often have these problems. Only a handful of the few dozen speakers I tried had persistent, noticeable lip-sync issues. Aside from occasional blips, all of our picks worked well in this regard.\nIf you plan to frequently use a speaker for video playback, look for devices with the most recent Bluetooth 5 technology and lower latency codecs like aptX. Also make sure the speaker is close to the source device as distance can be a factor. To avoid the issue altogether, though, consider getting one with a wired auxiliary input.\nExtra features\nSome speakers don’t just play music — they bring the party to life with built-in LED light effects and a full-on light show that syncs to your music. If you love a bit of visual flair with your tunes, it’s worth checking out models that offer LED light customization options.\nSound quality also plays a huge role in picking the right speaker. The best Bluetooth speaker should deliver a balanced mix of punchy bass, clear highs and strong vocals. Many models also include customizable sound modes that let you tweak the EQ to better suit different genres — whether you’re blasting EDM, listening to a podcast, or just want a more immersive experience that would impress even an audiophile.\nIf aesthetics matter, many models come in a tiny size that makes them extra portable, with plenty of color options to match your personal style. Whether you want a sleek black speaker or a vibrant eye-catching design, there are plenty of choices to fit your vibe.\nOther portable Bluetooth speakers we tested\nSonos Roam\nWhile there's a lot to like about the Sonos Roam, there are plenty of other Bluetooth speakers with more features and better battery life. In our review, we gave the Roam a score of 87, praising it for its good sound quality, durable waterproof design and ability to work well within an existing Sonos speaker ecosystem. But the price is just fine at $180, and we found Bluetooth speakers that offer more at lower price points. Plus, the Roam taps out at 10 hours of battery life, and all of our top picks can run for longer than that on a single charge.\nMonoprice Soundstage3\nThe Monoprice Soundstage3 offers relatively big sound at a midrange $250 price, with a variety of inputs rarely found on a portable Bluetooth speaker. The boxy, minimalist design is no nonsense, even if it's more of a less-rugged, bookshelf-styled homebody. While the speaker puts out crisp highs alongside booming lows, we found the bass can overpower the rest of the output, so it's not for everyone. And after using the speaker for many months, we also found the low-slung, poorly labeled button panel along the top can be a bit annoying to use. If you want a speaker for road trips, favor mids and highs, and plan on using physical buttons for volume control and input selections, there are better options out there.\nJBL Boombox 3\nFans of JBL’s bluetooth speaker sound profile who want to crank up the volume, but also want a rugged and portable option, may enjoy the JBL Boombox 3. It’s a decent grab-and-go speaker with a very loud output, although it's not as good as some of the loud-speaker styled options for long-throw sound and big outdoor areas. However, the price for this speaker line remains prohibitively expensive compared to other options with big sound that cover a bit more ground. If the JBL brand is your thing and you like the rugged, portable form factor, we recommend looking for discounts, or shopping around and exploring the available options including the (less portable) JBL PartyBox series.\nSoundcore Motion X500\nSoundcore speakers have generally been good and often reasonably priced. The Motion X500 loosely falls into that category. It has a tall, metallic lunchbox vibe with a fixed handle and pumps out a respectable 40 watts of crisp, clear sound for its size. It can get pretty loud and serves up a good dose of bass, although its primarily a front-facing speaker.\nThere’s LDAC hi-res audio support for Android users, but the main selling point on this is spatial audio. This is done through an EQ change and the activation of a small, up-firing driver. There’s a slight benefit from this if you’re up close and directly in front of it, but it’s not a total game changer for your listening experience. The original pre-order price of $130 made it a decent option in terms of bang for your buck. But it went up to $170 at launch, making it less appealing even if it’s still a good middle-of-the-road option if you want small-ish, clear and loud. If you can find one on sale for the lower price, it’s definitely worth considering. There’s also the larger and louder X600 ($200) if the overall concept is working for you.\nPortable Bluetooth speaker FAQs\nHow does a Bluetooth speaker work?\nBluetooth technology lets devices connect and exchange data over short distances using ultra high frequency (UHF) radio waves. It’s the frequency range that’s carved out for industrial, scientific and medical purposes, called the 2.4GHz ISM spectrum band. This range is available worldwide, making it easy for companies to use with devices for global markets.\nBluetooth speakers include this tech, which lets them communicate with source devices like smartphones, tablets or computers in order to exchange data. The two devices pair by sharing a unique code and will work within the proscribed range for the device and Bluetooth version. \nEver since Bluetooth 4.0 was released over a decade ago, new iterations usually improve on range, use less power and offer expanded connectivity with features like multipoint (allowing more than one device to be connected at the same time, for instance).\nWho should buy a Portable Bluetooth speaker?\nIf you want to play music while you’re out-and-about on something other than headphones, a portable Bluetooth speaker is probably what you want. There’s a broad range of devices for all types of circumstances. Many adventurous people will want a relatively lightweight portable that’s rugged enough to handle the elements while also packing enough charge to play for hours on end. Others may simply need a speaker they can move around the house or use in the backyard. In this case, you can choose larger less rugged models that may offer better sound. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/speakers/best-portable-bluetooth-speakers-133004551.html?src=rss",

Of course audio purists should know that it only supports SBC, but the sound quality is still top notch for most people. Other features include aptX support and quick-charge capabilities that provide four hours of listening time in just 20 minutes, plus great standby battery life.

    "summary": "Unhinged as Grok may be, it's now open source. xAI's CEO, Elon Musk, posted on X that the company made the older Grok 2.5 model available to the public and will do the same with the upcoming Grok 3. For now, anyone can download, run and even tweak Grok, whose source code was uploaded to the Hugging Face platform. However, there are restrictions to xAI's open-source license, which doesn't let people use Grok to train, create or improve other AI models.\nIt's not the first time xAI has made its models available to the public. In March 2024, the company released the raw base model of Grok-1, which isn't finetuned for any specific task. As xAI continues to make Grok more accessible, it's a stark contrast to OpenAI, which has only offered less powerful models of its ChatGPT model to researchers and businesses.\nMaking Grok open source allows independent developers to potentially improve on the AI model, but xAI is still trying to move past an extremely alarming episode of Grok providing antisemitic responses and referencing itself as MechaHitler. The Grok team attributed the incident to \"deprecated code\" that has since been fixed. As for Grok 3, Musk also said on X that it will also go open source in six months, but we may have to take that estimated release with a grain of salt, considering the CEO's other promised timelines.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/you-can-now-download-and-tweak-grok-25-for-yourself-as-it-goes-open-source-164734471.html?src=rss",
    "full_text": "Unhinged as Grok may be, it's now open source. xAI's CEO, Elon Musk, posted on X that the company made the older Grok 2.5 model available to the public and will do the same with the upcoming Grok 3. For now, anyone can download, run and even tweak Grok, whose source code was uploaded to the Hugging Face platform. However, there are restrictions to xAI's open-source license, which doesn't let people use Grok to train, create or improve other AI models. It's not the first time xAI has made its models available to the public. In March 2024, the company released the raw base model of Grok-1, which isn't finetuned for any specific task.

Ooni also discounted the Volt's cover as well, so you can pick on up for only $49 along with the oven itself.\nThe Volt 12 is an electric pizza oven that operates indoors, a first for the company. We praised the unit in our official review, saying that it \"works just as well\" as the company's indoor models. It preheats quickly and the interior is spacious. It can hit 850 degrees, which cooks a pizza in 90 seconds. \n \nThe oven also requires little-to-no supervision during use. It's pretty much a set it and forget it type appliance. This operates in stark contrast with the company's outdoor models, which demands that folks pay attention to the fire during use.\nThe Volt 12 made our list of the best pizza ovens, and it's absolutely the finest indoor model available right now. The only major downside is the price. It's tough to recommend any indoor kitchen doodad at $900, but it's easier to do so at $629.\nThis isn't the only interesting item on sale right now at Ooni.

    "summary": "Even though the Switch 2 basically just came out, we're already starting to see discounts on some of its accessories. One of the more charming peripherals, the HORI Piranha Plant camera, is on sale right now for only $40. That's $20 off and a record-low price. It's a good deal for anyone who wants to take advantage of the Switch 2's camera functionality in games like Mario Kart World and that recently-released campfire sim.\nThis was designed specifically for Nintendo's new console, so it's a plug-and-play affair. It's actually cheaper than the official Switch 2 camera with this sale and it looks a whole lot cooler. It's a Piranha Plant from the Mario franchise. We called it a \"work of art\" upon encountering the device and that holds true today. \n \nThis thing is not only stylish, resembling an Amiibo more than a camera, but it's downright useful. The pot the Piranha Plant sits in functions as both a stand and USB extension for the device. The plant itself detaches from the pot, so the camera can be used in portable mode by popping it into the USB port at the top of the console.\nThere's also a built-in privacy shutter. Just close the plant's mouth to obscure the lens. The actual camera specs here aren't going to win any awards, with a frame rate of 30FPS and a resolution of 640 x 480p. However, that's more than enough to capture footage of your floating head to accompany your kart as it races through the Mushroom Kingdom.\nFollow @EngadgetDeals on X for the latest tech deals and buying advice.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/horis-piranha-plant-camera-for-nintendo-switch-2-is-33-percent-off-right-now-145031014.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Meta has signed a partnership with Midjourney, an AI service that can generate images and videos from text prompts. According to Alexandr Wang, Meta's Chief AI Officer, Meta is licensing Midjourney's \"aesthetic technology\" for its future models and products. \"To ensure Meta is able to deliver the best possible products for people it will require taking an all-of-the-above approach. This means world-class talent, ambitious compute roadmap, and working with the best players across the industry,\" Wang added. \n1/ Today we’re proud to announce a partnership with @midjourney, to license their aesthetic technology for our future models and products, bringing beauty to billions.— Alexandr Wang (@alexandr_wang) August 22, 2025\n\nThe company previously launched its own AI image generator and AI video editor, but Midjourney's technology could help Meta offer services that can actually compete with rivals', such as OpenAI's Sora and Google's Veo. Midjourney made V7 its default model for image generation back in June. It described V7 as an \"entirely new\" AI image generation model that's much smarter at processing text prompts than its predecessors. It also released its V1 video model, which allows users to turn the images they generate into a short animated video, at the same time. \"We are incredibly impressed by Midjourney. They have accomplished true feats of technical and aesthetic excellence, and we are thrilled to be working more closely with them,\" Wang said on X. \nThis partnership is but Meta's latest move in its quest to form a Superintelligence laboratory and become a major player in the AI sphere. Mark Zuckerberg went on a hiring spreed and managed to convince several key players from rivals to join his company instead by offering them massive salaries and signing bonuses. Wang himself became the company's Chief AI office after Meta invested $14.8 billion in Scale AI, the company he founded.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/meta-is-licensing-midjourneys-ai-image-and-video-tech-120012178.html?src=rss",
