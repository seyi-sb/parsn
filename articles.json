    "summary": "So you need a new laptop — you’ve waited for the right time. Amazon Prime Day 2025, as has been in years past, offers a ton of laptop deals to consider. All kinds of devices are on sale this year, from refreshed MacBooks to high-end gaming machines to already affordable notebooks. But sussing out a good deal from a just-ok deal (or even worse, a bad deal all together), can be a challenge. Laptop prices on Amazon are all over the place even when it’s not Prime Day depending on the configuration of the notebook, the brand, the seller and a bunch of other factors.\nThis is where Engadget can help. We’ve poured over the Prime Day laptop deals available this year to pick out the best ones you can get across all kinds of computers. As always, if you’re super particular about the display panel you want in your next laptop, or you know you want to get as much RAM as possible, we recommend going straight to manufacturers to customize your next PC. But if you’re willing to work with premade models, Prime Day deals could help you save some cash on your next laptop. \nPrime Day laptop deals: MacBooks\nApple’s latest laptops are the MacBook Air M4 and the MacBook Pro M4, but the M3-powered machines are still available and great values when you can get them at steep discounts. But for the most future-proof options, we recommend going with the M4 MacBooks. Amazon actually has decent MacBook deals throughout the year, most of the time on the base configurations of any given model. In a welcomed update, Apple recently made all base models of the MacBook Air M4 have 16GB of RAM by default (which is the same as you’ll find on the base-level Pros).\n\n\n\nMacBook Air (15-inch, M4, 16GB RAM, 256GB SSD) for $1,049 ($150 off)\nMacBook Air (15-inch, M3, 24GB RAM, 512GB SSD) for $1,249 (26 percent off)\nMacBook Pro (14-inch, M4, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD) for $1,429 (11 percent off)\n\nPrime day laptop deals: Windows laptops\nYou’ve got a lot of variety to choose from when it comes to Windows laptops, and that can be a blessing or a curse. We recommend looking for a laptop from a reputable brand (i.e. Microsoft, Dell, Acer, Lenovo and others like them), and one that can handle daily work or play pressures. That means at least 8GB of RAM and 245GB of SSD storage, plus the latest Intel or AMD CPUs. If you’re looking for a new gaming laptop, you’ll need a bit more power and a dedicated graphics card to boot. Now is a good time to consider upgrading as well since Windows 10 will be sunset in October this year and Microsoft has recommended users upgrade to newer Windows 11 laptops.\n\n\n\nSamsung Galaxy Book5 360 (Windows 11, Copilot+, 15.6-inch, Intel Core Ultra 7, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD) for $1,000 (26 percent off)\nMicrosoft Surface laptop (Windows 11, Copilot+, 13.8-inch, Snapdragon X Plus) for $880 (27 percent off)\nLenovo V15 G2 laptop (Windows 11 Pro, 15.6-inch, Intel Celeron N4500, 32GB RAM, 1TB SSD) for $399 (33 percent off)\nMicrosoft Surface Pro 2-in-1 (Windows 11, Copilot+, 13-inch, Snapdragon X Plus, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD) for $870 (28 percent off)\nDell Inspiron 3520 laptop (Windows 11, 15.6-inch, Intel Core i5, 8GB RAM, 512GB SSD) for $350 (22 percent off)\nAcer Nitro V gaming laptop (Windows 11, 15.6-inch, Intel Core i5, RTX 4050, 8GB RAM, 512GB SSD) for $650 ($150 off)\nASUS ROG Strix G16 gaming laptop (Windows 11, Intel Core i9, RTX 4060, 16GB RAM, 1TB SSD) for $1,360 ($340 off)\n\nPrime Day laptop deals: Chromebooks\nMost Chromebooks start off pretty affordable, so that just means you can get them for even less during an event like Prime Day. If you’re a Chrome OS lover, it’s also a decent time to check out sales on premium Chromebooks, which can usually cost $500 or more. In general, we recommend looking for at least 4 to 8GB of RAM and at least 128GB of SDD storage in a Chromebook that you plan on using as your daily driver.\n\n\n\nHP Chromebook 14 (14-inch, Intel N100, 8GB RAM, 128GB UFS) for $200 (49 percent off)\nGoogle Pixelbook Go (13-inch, Intel Core M3, 8GB RAM, 64GB storage) for $319 (51 percent off)\nAcer Chromebook Plus 514 (14-inch, Intel Core i3, 8GB RAM, 128GB SSD) for $329 (18 percent off)\nHP Chromebook Plus x360 (14-inch, Intel Core i3, 8GB RAM, 128GB UFS) for $327 (45 percent off)\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-prime-day-laptop-deals-live-now-macbooks-windows-11-machines-chromebooks-and-others-130057906.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Amazon Prime Day typically brings great discounts on all sorts of electronics, but it’s a good idea to go for the expensive gear first. We consider robot vacuums to be in that category because, while there are solid affordable models available today, you’ll likely still spend at least $200 to get a robovac worth its salt.\nThese are some of the more expensive smart home gadgets you can get, but snagging them on discount during Prime Day can mean saving hundreds off the sticker price. Prime Day deals this year include some of our top picks for the best robot vacuums, slashing prices (in some cases) down to record lows. There are also some decent deals on cordless vacuums as well, if you prefer to invest in a vacuum with a bit more human control. These are the best Prime Day vacuum deals we could find. \nBest Prime Day robot vacuum deals\n\n\nEufy 11S Max robot vacuum for $140 (50 percent off): A favorite budget robot vacuum of ours, the 11S Max has a slim profile that allows it to easily get other some furniture that other robovacs can't reach. It does a good job of sucking up dirt and debris, and even though it doesn't have Wi-Fi connectivity, it comes with a remote control that gives you most of the functions an app would have.\niRobot Roomba 104 Combo robot vacuum and mop for $250 (44 percent off): This combo machine will vacuum and mop on its own, plus it comes with an auto-empty base as well. That means it will automatically empty the dry debris it collects into the base after every cleaning job.\niRobot Roomba Plus 405 for $400 (50 percent off): This newer Roomba model comes with a dock that both empties and refills its mopping reservoir and cleans its mop pad in between uses. In addition to mopping, this machine vacuums and supports smart mapping so you can better target where it should clean on a per-job basis.\nRoborock Q7 M5+ for $280 (35 percent off): This robovac has 10,000Pa suction power, LiDAR navigation, an anti-tangle brush design and Wi-Fi connectivity. It also comes with a self-cleaning base that can hold up to seven weeks of debris before it needs to be emptied.\nShark PowerDetect NeverTouch Pro robot vacuum and mop for $700 (42 percent off): This Shark machine is one of our favorites in part because it truly lives up to its name. Thanks to its self-emptying dock that handles vacuumed debris along with clean and dirty mopping water, you really don't have to touch the thing for at least 30 days in between cleanings. We found it to be a solid autonomous dirt sucker, and its mopping capabilities are quite good to match.\nBest Prime Day vacuum deals\n\n\nDyson V15 Detect Plus for $570 ($180 off): You can't get much better than a Dyson if you're on the market for a cordless stick vacuum, and the V15 Detect delivers. It's our current top pick for the best cordless vacuum overall thanks to its excellent suction power, lightweight design, good battery life and the included Fluffy Optic cleaning head that uses a laser to show you where all the debris is while you're using it.\nDyson V8 Plus cordless vacuum for $300 (36 percent off): This Dyson stick vacuum has 40 minutes of runtime, a lightweight design and two power modes to choose from. It comes with four attachments, including the Motorbar cleaner head that works on all floor types, and it can easily convert to a more compact handheld vacuum to take out to your car when it needs a cleaning.\nTineco Pure One Station Furfree cordless vacuum for $299 (25 percent off): This cordless vacuum has its own self-emptying base, and it comes with attachments to groom your pets. It has solid suction power and the built-in iLoop smart sensor automatically adjust suction power depending on the messes in its path.\nTineco Pure One Station 5 for $320 (30 percent off): One of our favorite cordless vacuums, the Pure One Station 5 has excellent suction power and good handling, plus a self-emptying base that makes it ultra-convenient. It also sports a single-button start and Tineco's iLoop smart sensor.\nShark PowerDetect Clean & Empty cordless vacuum for $400 (33 percent off): Shark's cordless vacuums are just as good as their robot vacuums, and you can usually find them on sale for less than other major brands. This one has great suction power and a relatively lightweight design, but the fact that it comes with a self-emptying base makes it an ultra-convenient choice.\nExpired deals\nShark AV2501S AI Ultra robot vacuum for $460 (16 percent off): A version of our favorite robot vacuum, this Shark machine has strong suction power and won't choke at the first sight of pet hair or big dust bunnies. Its self-emptying base is bagless as well, which means you won't have to buy propriety bags to refill it with over time. This auto-empty base has a 30-day capacity, but you can spend a bit more if you want a model with a 60-day capacity.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-amazon-prime-day-robot-vacuum-deals-that-you-can-get-right-now-for-2025-140049570.html?src=rss",

    "full_text": "Previously, he was a deputy editor covering technology companies at CNBC. Microsoft’s new 12-inch Surface Pro is awesome, and at $115 off at Best Buy, it’s a fantastic deal to jump on during Amazon Prime Day. Both Amazon and Microsoft are selling it for $699.99. No matter where you buy it, you can use the discount to cover most of the cost of the $150 keyboard, which anyone who’s interested int he Surface Pro should probably buy. You can think of it as a smaller, refined version of the Snapdragon X Plus Surface Pro from last year. And, for me, that OS means I’ll be able to do real work from pretty much anywhere. That’s not always true with applications on my M4 iPad Pro, though that should improve a bit once the multitasking updates arrive in iPadOS 26. Like me, he also digs its fanless design, great battery life, and sturdier keyboard. I agree with him that Microsoft still needs to improve its software experience for tablet mode; I still pick up my iPad when I need to do tablet stuff, not the Surface Pro. But, for everything else, Microsoft’s latest tablet suits my needs."

    "summary": "Big ticket items like laptops and iPads might get the lion’s share of the attention during Amazon's sale, but there are plenty of Prime Day deals under $50 to check out, too. We’ve combed through the pages (and pages) of discounts to find deals on the brands and gadgets that we’ve tested and recommend. Our picks include power accessories from Anker, smart plugs from TP-Link and the Spot smart speaker from Amazon Echo. We’ve also linked back to our reviews and buying guides to help with your shopping decisions. Here are the best Prime Day tech deals under $50.\nThe best Prime Day tech deals under $25\n\n\nSamsung Galaxy SmartTag2 Bluetooth tracker for $16 ($14 off): If you have a Samsung phone, the company’s own Bluetooth tracker may make the most sense for you. We say as much in our guide to these finding fobs. The design is attractive and the finding network admirable, drawing on the signals of nearby Galaxy devices to pinpoint your lost keys. \nAnker Right-Angle USB-C braided charging cable (two-pack) for $10 ($6 off with Prime): This is the cable I used to turn an old iPad into a digital picture frame. The right-angle looks much neater than a straight cable, plus this one can shuttle up to 240 watts of power during charging.\nAnker iPhone Nano Power Bank with Built-in USB-C Connector for $24 ($6 off with Prime): One of these little guys could represent the difference between a dead phone and a not-dead phone. It’s the size of an oldey-timey lipstick case and delivers a partial charge to any USB-C phone. We tested it out and awarded it a spot in our guide to power banks. The current discount only applies to the black colorway, and this is higher than the all-time low of $16 it hit for Black Friday.\nJLab Go Sport+ workout earbuds for $20 ($10 off): Anyone looking for a cheap set of beater earbuds for the gym should check this out. It’s a recommendation in our guide to the best budget wireless earbuds and offers a solid eight-to-nine hours of battery life, passable (if somewhat compressed) sound and a water-resistant, around-the-ear design.\nTP-Link Kasa Smart Bulbs for (four pack) for $22 (31 percent off): After testing a bunch of bulbs we deemed these the best value. Installation is easy, even for those new to smart devices, thanks to Kasa’s clean and simple app. Just note that voice control is only available with Alexa or the Google Assistant; Siri is unfortunately incompatible with these.\nAnker Nano USB-C charger block for $12 ($6 off): Remember when tiny bricks like this all maxed out at a dinky five-watts? This tiny but mighty cube is the best cheap fast charger in our guide to fast chargers and it outputs a generous 30 watts, plus the prongs fold down to make it even more teensy.\nKasa TP-Link Smart Wi-FI outdoor plug for $17 ($8 off with Prime): We tested this one for our buying guide to smart plugs and named it the best outdoor pick for HomeKit users — but it’ll work with Alexa and the Google Assistant too. The range was decent and setup was easy, like most TP-Link plugs. Grab this now and have automatic control of your holiday lights.\nBlink Mini 2 security camera for $20 ($20 off with Prime): If you only want one Blink security camera, snag this deal. But if you can spring for a two-pack at $35, it's actually a better deal. Either way, it's our pick for the best budget security camera. Just note it requires a subscription for person detection and cloud storage, and the image quality wasn’t the best of the bunch. \nJLab Go Sport+ wireless Earbuds for $20 ($10 off): Here’s a pick from our list of the best budget wireless earbuds. The around-the-ear hook design stays in place during rigorous movement and they’re water-resistant enough to handle sweaty sessions at the gym.\nAmazon Fire TV Stick HD for $18 ($17 off with Prime): We name this the best budget streaming stick on our list of the best streaming devices. It's easy to set up and so you can access all of the major streaming platforms. Just note that it only streams content at 1080p, not 4K and the UI is more ad-heavy than competing streamers.\nApple AirTag for $20 ($9 off): Here’s our pick for a Bluetooth tracker for iPhone users. These little discs have the most accurate finding ability of any fob we tested, thanks to Apple’s vast Find My network that taps into all nearby iPhones to track down your missing stuff. They could be louder and hole would be nice, but nothing beats its accuracy. Just note that you'll get a cheaper per-tag price if you buy a four-pack. \nSamsung Fit Plus 56GB flash drive for $23 ($12 off): We named this the best thumbstick drive in our guide to the best SSDs. It has a sleek design, five-year warranty and has a USB 3.1 connection. There’s even a small attachment point for a keychain so you can take your extra storage drive with you when you go.\nJ-Tech Digital Ergonomic Mouse for $15 ($10 off with Prime and on-page coupon): The lowest price we’ve seen for one of our favorite ergonomic mice is $17 and now it’s even cheaper. This is the budget pick in our ergonomic mouse guide thanks to its vertical format, programmable buttons and nifty RBC lights (which you can turn off).\nAnker USB-C Cable 240W Bio-Braided for $13 ($6 off with Prime): We recommend this in our guide to iPhone accessories. It’s a reliable cable that’s durable and capable of fast charging (provided you have the right wall adapters). This matches its price in past sales.\nThermacell E55 Rechargeable Repeller for $18 ($17 off with Prime): The mosquitos aren’t going anywhere. Even places that didn’t used to have these evil bloodsuckers are now overrun. If you would like some reprieve from the bites, this is the repeller we recommend in our guide to outdoor tech.\nTP-Link AC1200 WiFi extender for $20 ($10 off): If you’ve got some dead spots in your home’s internet coverage and aren’t quite ready for a mesh setup, a Wi-Fi extender can help. This is our favorite budget option in our guide to these plug-in devices thanks to its easy setup and user-friendly app.\nAmazon Echo Pop for $22 ($18 off with Prime): The smallest (and cheapest) Echo speaker is ideal for small apartments or rooms. The half-sphere design comes in purple and teal in addition to the standard black and white colorways. It's gone as low as $18 in past Prime Day sales. \nSoundcore Select 4 Go Bluetooth speaker for $19 ($16 off with Prime): One of the newest additions to our guide to the best Bluetooth speakers is this ‘lil guy from Soundcore (Anker). We found it had decent sound quality and was loud enough to fill a standard-sized living room. It's gone as low at $20 in the past.\nChipolo POP Bluetooth tracker for $25 ($4 off): The top pick in our guide to the best Bluetooth trackers was finally knocked off its throne — by another tracker from the same brand. This is our current recommendation for most people. It taps into either Apple’s Find My or Google’s Find My Device network (but just one at a time) and has a loud ring, quick Bluetooth connection and comes in fun colors.\nAmazon Smart Plug for $13 ($12 off with Prime): This plug and an Alexa Echo device makes a perfect smart home starter kit (and a number of Echos are on sale for Prime Day, too). Snap this into your outlet and Alexa should automatically detect it (if not, a few taps in the Alexa app should get things connected). Then you can use it to control any lamp, fan or other simple device you plug into it — just by asking the assistant.\nRoku Streaming Stick HD for $20 ($10 off): Roku just released two new streaming sticks this year. This standard model and the Plus model that supports 4K resolution. We recommend the latter in our guide to streaming sticks as the best way to catch free and live content, but if you don't have a 4K TV (or don't care about the resolution) you can grab this stick for 33 percent off. The Plus model is also on sale. \nThe best Prime Day tech deals under $35\n\n\nTP-Link Kasa Smart Plug Mini EP25 (4-pack) for $30 ($14 off with Prime): This is our favorite smart plug overall because it works with all four major smart home assistants (Alexa, Siri, Google Assistant and Samsung’s Bixby). In our tests, it connected easily and reliably controlled our lamps and other simple appliances.\nBlink Mini 2 security camera (two-pack) for $35 ($35 off with Prime): Our pick for the best budget security camera is now even more budget friendly. We appreciated this diminutive camera’s ease of setup and excellent integration with Alexa devices, like Echo speakers and displays. It requires a subscription for person detection and cloud storage, and the image quality wasn’t the best of the bunch. If you just need one camera, you can pick one up for $20.\nJBL Go 3 for $28 (30 percent off): The JBL Go 4 gets a shout out in our guide to Bluetooth speakers, this is its predecessor. It's got a carabiner-friendly design, five hours of battery life, and IP67-rated waterproofing and dustproofing. It's not exactly powerful, but it's way better than a phone speaker for driving, trekking or camping.\nRoku Streaming Stick Plus for $30 ($10 off): Roku replaced the Streaming Stick 4K with this model (which also supports 4K) earlier this year. We think it’s the best streaming stick for people who want to access free and live content on their TV. Roku’s interface is easy to use, colorful and lets you watch thousands of hours of free stuff, through Roku’s own content and more. You also get decently organized access to your paid content.\nAnker USB C Charger (Nano 65W) for $26 ($14 off with Prime): This is a similar model to the travel pick in our fast charger guide. It has three ports, two USB-C that deliver up to 65 watts each and a USB-A that can output 22 watts. That should refill your laptop, tablet and maybe some earbuds while not taking up too much space.\nAmazon Echo Dot Kids with Alexa for $32 ($28 off with Prime): The kids version of Amazon's smart speaker is the same hardware but with a kid-themed cover (owl or dragon) and it comes with a free year-long subscription to Amazon Kids+ with audiobooks, games and educational Alexa skills.  \nBlink Video Doorbell for $30 ($30 off with Prime): If you already use Alexa in your home and want a compatible video doorbell, you may want to check out this deal. Note that you’ll need a Blink subscription and a Blink Sync Module to store clips and to access other features. You can wire it to your existing doorbell wires or use it wirelessly with two AA batteries that can last up to two years.\nMoft Magnetic Phone Tripod for $32 ($8 off with Prime): I was impressed with how sturdily this small tripod held my phone. It folds down super thin but pops up to hold the phone in landscape or portrait orientation. The only downside is you’ll need to pop it off to wirelessly recharge (obviously) but removal and reattachment is quick.\nEarFun Free 2S wireless earbuds for $28 (30 percent off with Prime): These are fairly comfortable, have a good waterproof rating and deliver a decent amount of bass. They’re not going to deliver the fullest or most nuanced sound as more expensive buds, but for far less than $50, they’re a fine knockaround pair.\nAnker Soundcore 2 for $28 (38 percent off): The Soundcore 2 is an older bluetooth speaker, but it holds up — fully waterproof, with 24 hours of battery life and bass you can hear on the other side of a pool. It's on sale for less than $30. \n-> If you're looking for more speaker deals, check out our Prime Day speaker guide. \nThe best Prime Day tech deals under $50\n\n\nSoundcore by Anker Space A40 earbuds for $45 ($35 off with Prime): The top overall pick in our guide to the best budget earbuds delivers the kind of performance and features we’d expect from buds priced twice as high. These lil guys have effective active noise cancellation and a good battery life of eight hours — plus another 40 with the case.\nLexar Professional Silver Plus (512GB) for $38 ($35 off): We found this microSD card to be the best value of all the cards we tested. It consistently delivered faster sequential reads and writes than other models. If you need storage for your gaming handhels, camera, drone or other devices, may as well stock up now. \nHyperX Cloud Stinger 2 gaming headset for $37 ($14 off): In our guide to gaming headsets, we ultimately recommend getting an external mic along with a good pair of wired headphones for chatting. But if you really want a two-in-one, the Cloud Stinger 2 is our pick for a budget gaming headset.\nRazer Basilisk V3 gaming mouse for $36 ($34 off with Prime): Some prefer a wired connection when playing games. Razer’s Basilisk V3 is our top budget pick for a wired mouse in our gaming mouse guide. It’s comfortable, well-built, accurate and a good value — particularly with a Prime Day discount.\nAmazon Echo Spot for $45 ($35 off with Prime): The Spot speaker was resurrected last year with a slightly different design than it first had. Now the display is a half-circle on the round face of the clock and it can show you the weather, time and song title. The speaker itself brings you all Alexa can do, like setting timers, adding stuff to your grocery lists and answering questions about the weather.\nLeebin Electric Spin Scrubber for $38 (46 percent off): This was Deputy Editor Valentina Palladino's favorite thing she bought last year because it makes the must-detested chore of cleaning her shower less of a pain. It's an electric spin scrubber that comes with multiple cleaning heads so you can use it on your countertops, sinks, tubs and showers and more. It also has an adjustable arm so you can reach tough spots in hard-to-reach places, and it convenient recharges via USB-C.\nAmazon Echo Buds with Active Noise Cancellation for $45 ($95 off with Prime): These buds are a bit old at this point, as they came out in 2021, but the 68 percent discount could be compelling. In our review, we said the buds were much improved over the last generation. They're more comfortable and have a better sound quality. Plus the Alexa integration makes them a decent pick for those who've gone all-in on Amazon's ecosystem. \nRing Pan-Tilt Indoor Cam for $40 ($40 off with Prime): This indoor security camera can spin 360 degrees and has a tilt range of 169 degrees so you can keep tabs on pets and other happenings at home. It'll let you drop in for a live view from your phone, and supports two-way talk for telling your pup to get off the couch.\nUGreen Revodok Pro 109 USB-C Hub for $32 ($22 off): The top pick in our guide to the best USB-C hubs has a good array of ports, including an HDMI 2.0 connection that supports 4K monitors at 60Hz, plus three USB-A ports, Ethernet and one USB-C (plus another for delivering 90W of power to your device. The hub has gone as low as $30 in prior sales. \nAmazfit Band 7 fitness tracker for $38 ($12 off with Prime): The runner up in our guide to the best, cheap fitness trackers has a comfortable design we found easy to sleep with and a great, mutli-week battery life. The screen isn’t as bright and it wasn’t quite as speedy as our top pick, but it does let you easily set custom goals.\nHamilton Beach Digital Programmable Rice Cooker for $40 ($10 off with Prime): Our top pick for a budget rice cooker is on sale for Prime members. The brown rice came out particularly good in our tests and the cooker is easy to clean with a dishwasher-safe cooker pot and steamer basket. Just note that it’s pretty small and doesn’t have the granular controls of pricer models.  \n-> See more kitchen tech Prime day deals in our guide. \nExpired deals\nBlink Outdoor 4 for $45 ($55 off): We named this outdoor camera the best for Alexa homes in our security cameras guide. It can go just about anywhere you want as the wireless design runs on AA batteries and can last for two years before needing to be replaced. The motion alerts are accurate, but keep in mind you’ll need a subscription to enable person detection and cloud storage.\nAmazon Echo Buds for $15 (70 percent off with Prime): In our guide to the best budget earbuds, we called Amazon’s latest earbuds the best option for an open-ear design. That means they don’t go all the way in your ear canal, which is far more comfortable for some people. They’re sturdy, comfortable and the sound is decent once you’ve fiddled with the EQ settings to bring down the treble. This is a lightning deal and the lowest price we've seen yet.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-amazon-prime-day-deals-under-50-save-on-gear-from-samsung-blink-anker-and-others-160028991.html?src=rss",
    "full_text": "The right-angle looks much neater than a straight cable, plus this one can shuttle up to 240 watts of power during charging. It’s the size of an oldey-timey lipstick case and delivers a partial charge to any USB-C phone. Anker Nano USB-C charger block for $12 ($6 off): Remember when tiny bricks like this all maxed out at a dinky five-watts? Just note that it only streams content at 1080p, not 4K and the UI is more ad-heavy than competing streamers. This is the budget pick in our ergonomic mouse guide thanks to its vertical format, programmable buttons and nifty RBC lights (which you can turn off). We think it’s the best streaming stick for people who want to access free and live content on their TV. These lil guys have effective active noise cancellation and a good battery life of eight hours — plus another 40 with the case. If you need storage for your gaming handhels, camera, drone or other devices, may as well stock up now. The motion alerts are accurate, but keep in mind you’ll need a subscription to enable person detection and cloud storage. That means they don’t go all the way in your ear canal, which is far more comfortable for some people."

    "full_text": "A new report estimates that AI will be a larger-than-ever part of the online shopping process during Amazon’s Prime Day sale, which began Tuesday morning. Amazon’s annual sale, which this year spans four days (July 8-11), is predicted to drive $23.8 billion in online spending across U.S. e-commerce retailers, as other businesses run their own competing sales alongside the popular shopping event. The firm’s analysis encompasses over 1 trillion visits to U.S. retail websites, including 100 million SKUs across 18 product categories. Mobile will be a large part of that equation, accounting for more than half (52.5%) of sales, but this year, generative AI will also play a role. During the Prime Day event, Adobe estimates that traffic from generative AI sources will increase 3,200% year-over-year. This is still a much smaller source than other channels, like paid search and email, but Adobe believes it will continue to grow as consumers see the value in using AI for shopping. The company also cited a survey of 5,000 U.S. consumers, which indicated that people were using gen AI for research (55% of respondents), product recommendations (47%), finding deals (43%), getting gift ideas (35%), finding unique products (35%), and creating shopping lists (33%). Of those who used gen AI, 92% said it enhanced their purchase experience, and 87% said they are more likely to use AI for larger or more complex purchases. AI providers have been capitalizing on this trend by integrating AI into shopping, as Google has with Gemini-enhanced product search, and OpenAI has with the addition of shopping features in ChatGPT, for example. Adobe’s forecast says that consumers this Prime Day will be focused on discounts, with apparel having the biggest deals."

    "summary": "Amazon's Prime Day is a great time to pick up gear and upgrades you wouldn't normally think about. In case you've never used a solid-state drive (SSD) before, it's a class of add-ons that bolster a device's built-in storage. Not only will your phone, laptop or console be able to hold more data, but more of those files will be quickly accessible, which can vastly improve your speeds. If you have used an SSD before, you know what you're looking for — the best discounted drives on Amazon. We've curated a list below for your Prime Day shopping.\nBest Prime Day SSD deals\n\n\n\nCrucial P310 1TB for $60 (20 percent off): This deal on the Crucial P310 is one of the best we've seen so far for a Gen 4 SSD. At the 1TB capacity, it reads up to 7,100MB per second for noticeably faster performance. Just be warned that the deal doesn't include a heatsink.\nCrucial BX500 for $57 (40 percent off): The Crucial BX500 SSD is compatible with any computer that uses a 2.5-inch SATA drive — which is still plenty of them. For very cheap, you can get ahold of 1TB storage space and read speeds up to 540 MB/s, close to the very best possible for a SATA SSD.\nWD_BLACK SN850X for $150 (25 percent off): Our current favorite Gen4 NVMe drive is on sale for Prime Day, making a read speed of over 7,000 MB/s more accessible than ever. In our tests, we found the 1TB SN850X significantly boosted our Windows operating speeds without adding much heat.\nWD Blue SN5000 for $210 (30 percent off): Here's a great deal on an internal SSD with 4TB capacity and compatibility with the fast-performing NVMe protocol. Western Digital, the same brand behind the WD_BLACK (see above) claims the Blue model can hit read speeds of 5,500 MB/s.\nSabrent Rocket 2230 for $150 (45 percent off): The Sabrent Rocket 2230 is a thumbnail-sized NVMe card that we found to be perfect for the M.2 slot on a Steam Deck. Thanks to this deal, you can save a lot by buying a lower-end Steam Deck and upgrading it with one of these.\nSamsung Fit Plus for $23 (34 percent off): The Fit Plus is our favorite thumb drive, and it's not close. Running on USB 3.1 with transfer speeds between 300 and 400 MB/s, it even comes with a keychain hook. The current deal takes 34 percent off an already cheap product.\nSamsung 870 EVO for $76 (24 percent off): The 870 EVO is a great budget choice for general users, who are likely to get a speed boost on any PC activity once it's installed. At 560 MB/s of maximum reading speed, it's not for hardcore gamers, but everyday users should see real benefits.\nSamsung 990 Pro for $150 (29 percent off): The whole Samsung Pro line of SSDs is excellent for gamers, with PS5s in particular seeming to run much faster with one installed. The 990 Pro can reach read speeds of up to 1,400 KB/s — and yes, that's kilobytes, not megabytes.\nSamsung 9100 Pro for $220 (31 percent off): Samsung's first NVMe SSD dropped earlier this year, and currently, they're still a bit faster than most people can use. However, if you want to get a jump on the next console generation with 14,800 MB/s sequential reading speed, this deal is your opportunity.\nKingston Fury Renegade for $420 (33 percent off): Although it sounds like a Jamaican kung fu movie we'd watch the hell out of, the Kingston Fury Renegade is actually a 5th-gen NVMe SSD that can reach hardcore read speeds of up to 14,800 MB/s. It's expensive, but Prime Day discounts knock off 33 percent.\nCorsair MP600 Pro LPX 2 TB for $160 (20 percent off): Earlier this year, we named the Corsair MP600 Pro LPX as the top SSD for PS5, partly due to its affordability. It's even more affordable now — and the low price even includes a heatsink.\n\nBest Prime Day portable SSD deals\n\nSamsung T7 for $114 (39 percent off): The T7 spent a long time as our reigning champion portable SSD, and it's still an amazing deal — being technically outdated means record-low prices on hardware that's more than fast enough for a Steam Deck or Switch.\nSamsung T9 for $170 (43 percent off): We once named the Samsung T7 as our favorite portable SSD, but the T9 handily outdoes it, nearly doubling data transfer speeds. It's marked down 43 percent from now until the end of Prime Day on the 11th.\nCrucial X9 Pro 1TB for $75 (17 percent off): As a Gen 2 USB drive, the Crucial X9 Pro loses out to some newer competitors on speed — but it's much cheaper, and far more compatible with everyday personal computers. The 1TB model is on sale at 17 percent off its normal price.\nCrucial X9 Pro 2TB for $120 (33 percent off): The Crucial X9 Pro with 2TB storage space is marked down 33 percent for Prime Day.\nCrucial X9 Pro 4TB $260 (10 percent off): If you're after the highest-capacity model of the Crucial X9 Pro, you can grab it for 10 percent off through the end of Prime Day.\nCrucial X10 1TB for $82 (41 percent off): The Crucial X10 is a portable SSD for power users, only working at full strength on devices that support the latest version of USB 3.2. If that's what your build needs, you're not likely to see it much cheaper than this.\nCrucial X10 2TB for $135 (18 percent off): A 2TB version of the X10 is almost 20 percent off right now.\nCrucial X10 Pro 2TB for $150 (28 percent off): The Crucial X10 Pro is perfect for a fairly small range of users. If your PC build currently works with USB 3.2 Gen 2x2 but isn't yet handling USB4 or Thunderbolt, you won't find a faster portable SSD for your needs.\nKingston XS1000 for $80 (15 percent off): We named the Kingston XS1000 the second-best portable SSD in our current roundup, so it's great to see it going for 15 percent off today. It's almost as fast as the Crucial X9 Pro, just not quite as tough.\nADATA SE920 for $142 (5 percent off): The piddly 5 percent off is disappointing, but there's nothing disappointing about the ADATA SE920 itself. This is the ideal model for anyone regularly making huge downloads. The SE920's maximum read speed of 3,800 MB/s would be impressive for a full-size SSD, but it's fully portable, weighing less than half a pound.\n\nBest Prime Day microSD card deals\n\nLexar Professional Silver Plus for $38 (48 percent off): Our tests showed this to be the fastest microSD card on the market, beating out the whole Samsung line. Not only is it fast enough to download and upload 4K files without trying your patience, it's also waterproof, cheap and squeezes in both USB-A and USB-C ports.\nSamsung Pro Plus for $17 (35 percent off): The Samsung Pro Plus is a great microSD card for most needs, so if it's cheaper than the Lexar option, go for it. We've found that it's particularly good in handheld game systems. Just make sure to get the version rated for 180 MB/s, nothing less (it should say on the package).\nSanDisk Ultra 256GB microSDXC for $17 (15 percent off): If you're still rocking the Switch 1 (thanks, Target) and want a cheap storage expander, this deal on a SanDisk 256GB microSD card is for you. It's going for $17 right now, far less than most of the games you're likely to store on it.\nSamsung Evo Select for $22 (27 percent off): This one's by far the best option if you're after a cheap microSD card — we've seen it on sale for less than $25 more than once. It's a bit too slow for cameras, but fine for any kind of undemanding passive storage.\n\nBest Prime Day external hard drive deals\n\nSeagate Portable for $65 (18 percent off): All the Seagate hard drives we've used are refreshingly good at combining thin, light hardware with consistent speeds, and the Portable is no exception. At 4TB, this is a great deal on an external HDD with no tradeoffs.\nSeagate Game Drive for $76 (15 percent off): Seagate's Game Drive is a prime choice for adding extra space to a PS5 or Xbox Series X. Formerly overpriced, it's now dropped down to $90 for 2 TB, and that's before Prime Day makes it even cheaper.\nWD My Passport for $153 (17 percent off): The Western Digital My Passport line is ancient by computer hardware standards, but it's been updated as far as USB 3.0 and 3.1, and remains one of the cheaper options for a 6 TB hard drive. This version includes automatic backup software.\nWD Elements for $149 (15 percent off): The Elements HDD from Western Digital has gotten consistently positive feedback from our staff over the years, and as an older model, it's now wildly cheap for 6 TB of storage. It's compatible with both PC and Mac out of the box.\nWD_BLACK P10 Game Drive for $161 (15 percent off): We're big fans of the WD_BLACK SSD, and the gaming-focused external P10 is a worthy companion. It comes with 6 TB of storage for your PC, PS5, or Xbox gaming library.\nUnionSine 500GB External Hard Drive for $27 (19 percent off): UnionSine's HDD is fast and USB3 compatible. Despite how thin and light it is, we've found it remarkably hard to damage. 500GB may be a bit tight with the size of files these days, but at this price, you could just buy two of them.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-prime-day-ssd-and-external-hard-drive-deals-on-samsung-crucial-and-more-090355162.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Prime Day is the time to trawl Amazon for the best in all things, including high-quality speakers at bargain prices. For much less than usual, you can add a new lynchpin to your soundsystem. That could be a space-saving soundbar for a smaller space, a smart speaker to jam out while you're busy in the kitchen or a bluetooth speaker you can bring with you anywhere. We've rounded up a list that includes Echo, JBL, Beats, Anker Soundcore and more of the best audio brands — so if you're ready to hear every last eighth-note of your favorite tracks, let's get started.\nBest Prime Day Bluetooth speaker deals\nOur portable bluetooth speaker picks are some of the best all-around mobile music devices to ever hit the shelves: smaller and lighter than a boombox, better audio than an iPod, and way easier in the long run than learning to play guitar. We've sifted through Prime Day offerings to find the best portable speakers in all shapes and sizes. \n\n\n\nTribit Stormbox Micro 2 for $56 (20 percent off): This tiny portable speaker packs a wallop — you won't believe how high you can crank the volume on such a small, light device. Weighing in at about one pound, it includes a rubber strap for attaching it to your backpack or bike, and comes with a USB charging port.\nBeats Pill for $98 (35 percent off): The Beats Pill is one of the few portable bluetooth speakers we liked enough to give it a full review. Those of you who love the classic Beats bluetooth speakers will be happy to know they're back in fine form. Nobody can beat the Pill for bass, and its sound is crisp and lossless at almost any frequency and volume. For some reason, only the Kim Kardashian branded version is on sale, but it's the exact same speaker.\nAnker Soundcore 2 for $29 (35 percent off): The Soundcore 2 is an older bluetooth speaker, but it holds up — fully waterproof, with 24 hours of battery life and bass you can hear on the other side of a pool. It's on sale for less than $30.\nUE Everboom for $200 (25 percent off): If you want something stronger than the Wonderboom but the Hyperboom isn't portable enough, the Everboom is a great middle ground. Its ideal range is a little narrow, but it makes up for that with 360-degree sound and extreme durability (i.e. so waterproof it literally floats).\nJBL Xtreme 2 for $255 (80 percent off): The Xtreme 2 is an older model, dating back to 2018 — but as they say on the internet, it checks out. With a maximum output of 40 watts, it's actually more powerful than the Xtreme 4. Even better, this deal includes a pair of speakers that can work together through JBL connect+.\nJBL Go 3 for $28 (30 percent off): The JBL Go 3 improves on its predecessor with a carabiner-friendly design, five hours of battery life, and IP67-rated waterproofing and dustproofing. It's not exactly powerful, but it's way better than a phone speaker for driving, trekking or camping.\nJBL Go 3 Eco for $28 (30 percent off): This is the same as the JBL Go 3, but made from mostly recycled materials — 90 percent of the plastic and 100 percent of the fabric is post-consumer.\nJBL Pulse 5 for $200 (20 percent off): The Pulse 5 is JBL's latest and greatest party speaker, throwing out 360-degree light bursts that sync up to the music. There's substance behind the flash, too, with speakers designed around the bass frequencies and 12 hours of battery life.\nBose SoundLink Flex 2nd Gen for $99 (33 percent off): This mini speaker from Bose is one of our favorites on the list for hands-free phone calls. It supports both Google Assistant and Siri and runs up to 12 hours on one charge, all while being smaller than a clutch purse. It also kills as a portable music player, though the sound doesn't stretch far enough to fill a room.\nBose Soundlink Revolve+ Series II for $179 (40 percent off): The Revolve series was Bose's first line of 360-degree outdoor speakers, and they're still a strong choice today. The Revolve+ weighs about two pounds and can run for 17 hours without recharging.\nBose Soundlink Max for $299 (25 percent off): Bose's Soundlink Max marries a classic carrying-case design with audio that sounds like it's coming from a much bigger unit. It comes with a 20-hour battery and IP67-rated protection against the elements.\nMarshall Emberton II for $95 (47 percent off): Marshall has been making audio equipment for more than 60 years, and still has a thing or two to teach the young'ns. The Emberton II looks like a classic amp, but weighs a quarter of a pound and provides balanced sound for more than 30 hours per charge.\n\nBest Prime Day smart speaker deals\nSmart speakers aren't just about getting a disembodied voice to do your bidding (or at least as much of your bidding as Alexa can do without hands). On top of assistant support, the picks below serve up legitimately great audio quality alongside useful extra features. The only downside is that they're often overpriced, but that's what Prime Day is for.\n\nAmazon Echo Dot for $32 (36 percent off): Amazon may not have updated the Echo Dot since 2022, but that just goes to show how well this spherical smart speaker serves as the perfect host for Alexa. Both music and speech sound clear, and it's easy to integrate with other smart home devices. Right now, it's marked down more than a third.\nAmazon Echo Pop for $22 (45 percent off): The latest Echo Pop release continues the trend of making Alexa's best features available on a mini-sized, reasonably priced device. Its half-spherical design fits on any desk or shelf, and its sound output is consistently clear — and gets louder than you might believe.\nSonos Era 100 for $179 (10 percent off): Smart speakers from the Amazon Echo line play perfectly good music, but true audiophiles in need of assistant support should look to Sonos. The Era 100 has tweeters and woofers precisely arranged for clear, full-room sound, and it's easy to hook up to your other audio gear. Just be warned it only supports Alexa, not Google Assistant.\nJBL Authentics 200 for $200 (47 percent off): JBL's Authentics line is modeled after a product it sold in the 70s. Its old-school bookshelf-friendly design belies its advanced feat of running Google Assistant and Alexa simultaneously (as opposed to other smart speakers where you have to pick just one).\nJBL Authentics 300 for $300 (33 percent off): The JBL Authentics 300 can host both Alexa and Google Assistant at the same time, which impressed us enough that we gave it a full review. While we had some issues — namely its tendency to over-emphasize vocals — we can't quibble with its high-range performance or retro design.\n\nBest Prime Day soundbar deals\nFlatter, lighter and larger TV screens are nice for visuals, but often sacrifice sound quality to lose weight. If you've found yourself turning on the subtitles for your shows more often lately, you might need a soundbar to augment your TV's built-in speakers. We found a few of the best on sale for Prime Day — Sonos leads this space, but it's not without competitors.\n\nBose Smart for $400 (20 percent off): In our full review of the Bose Smart, we noted that two drivers in the center make its sound feel directional without any other speakers needed — simply cranking up those makes any audio more immersive. You can also link it to a pair of Ultra Open Earbuds (not included) for a private surround sound experience.\nBose Smart Ultra for $700 (22 percent off): The Smart Ultra upgrades the Bose Smart with a more sophisticated calibration system which adjusts sound settings to fill whatever room it's in. If you want the Smart's personal surround experience for more than one person, the Smart Ultra is for you.\nSonos Beam for $369 (26 percent off): The Sonos Beam is a fantastic choice for a mid-budget soundbar. It's one of the most accessible Dolby Atmos systems, and uses careful audio alterations to achieve a much more immersive sound than other bars of its size.\nSonos Ray for $169 (15 percent off): If you're looking to pay a bit less, go with the Sonos Ray to maximize sound quality on a budget. The audio won't wrap around your room like it might from a more premium model, but it's still a vast improvement on nearly all built-in TV speakers.\nSony HT-S400 for $178 (41 percent off): Sony built the HT-S400 for everyone who wants a soundbar but not an entire home theater. It's a 2.1-channel system that still manages immersive surround sound and is easy to integrate with Sony TVs. Right now, it's 40 percent off, one of the best prices we've seen on any soundbar.\nVIZIO 2.0 for $78 (22 percent off): Vizio's budget soundbar makes a worthy alternative to the Sonos Ray. It punches above its weight and gets as close as possible to Dolby Atmos surround sound as a single unit can manage. For less than $100, you'll never mishear a line of dialogue again.\nJBL Bar 9.1 for $760 (37 percent off): The 9.1 is JBL's first sound bar to be compatible with Dolby Atmos, and it doesn't disappoint. Each unit comes with two wireless speakers you can move around your viewing room, and there's even a 4K passthrough input to ensure your sound system doesn't mess with image quality.\nSennheiser Ambeo Mini for $600 (25 percent off): We recommend the Sennheiser Ambeo Mini for a relatively cheap premium soundbar. It excels in smaller spaces (though it needs an extra subwoofer to fill larger ones), and its connected app includes several sound presets you can use to optimize its virtual speakers.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/best-prime-day-speaker-deals-on-jbl-bose-sonos-and-others-085948443.html?src=rss",
    "full_text": "For much less than usual, you can add a new lynchpin to your soundsystem. We've rounded up a list that includes Echo, JBL, Beats, Anker Soundcore and more of the best audio brands — so if you're ready to hear every last eighth-note of your favorite tracks, let's get started. We've sifted through Prime Day offerings to find the best portable speakers in all shapes and sizes. Smart speakers aren't just about getting a disembodied voice to do your bidding (or at least as much of your bidding as Alexa can do without hands). On top of assistant support, the picks below serve up legitimately great audio quality alongside useful extra features. Amazon Echo Dot for $32 (36 percent off): Amazon may not have updated the Echo Dot since 2022, but that just goes to show how well this spherical smart speaker serves as the perfect host for Alexa. Its old-school bookshelf-friendly design belies its advanced feat of running Google Assistant and Alexa simultaneously (as opposed to other smart speakers where you have to pick just one). JBL Authentics 300 for $300 (33 percent off): The JBL Authentics 300 can host both Alexa and Google Assistant at the same time, which impressed us enough that we gave it a full review. Flatter, lighter and larger TV screens are nice for visuals, but often sacrifice sound quality to lose weight. We found a few of the best on sale for Prime Day — Sonos leads this space, but it's not without competitors."

    "summary": "Prime Day 2025 is finally here, and members can save on a bunch of tech available on Amazon's site. One such standout deal is on the Roomba Robot Vacuum and Mop Combo, which is down to $140 for Prime members right now. That's nearly half off its usual price and a far cry from its standard $275 cost.\nWe ranked iRobot's Roomba Robot Vacuum as our overall favorite budget option, but this Prime Day deal features a version that can both vacuum and mop. With the Prime Day price drop, the vacuum and mop combo is cheaper than the vacuum-only model, but it does double the work. The combo Roomba can even be set to only vacuum if you prefer to mop yourself, but you'd be missing out on the four-stage cleaning system that vacuums and mops in the same pass. \n\n\n\nSince it's a Roomba, it's a straightforward setup process that takes a few minutes before you can set it and forget it. The robot vacuum can navigate through your house or apartment, avoiding furniture and stairs, thanks to onboard sensors. Once it drains through its battery, which can last up to 120 hours, the Roomba knows to return to its charging dock to recharge itself. You can even customize this combo Roomba with three levels of both suction power for vacuuming and water levels for mopping. For more control, you can program it to spot clean a single spot in your home or schedule cleaning times through the companion iRobot Home app.\nA number of other iRobot machines are on sale for Prime Day as well.

    "summary": "Amazon’s Prime Day in July is here, and it’s the perfect time to consider upgrading that old 1080p or first-gen 4K set, or just snag something for another room. While it’s been great to see TV prices fall in general over the years, there’s always room for even more discounts. And yes that includes typically high-end technology like OLED and Mini LED screens. We’ve collected the best Prime Day discounts on sets from Sony, Samsung, LG and others, along with additional deals on media streamers and soundbars. It turns out, you really don’t have to spend a ton to nab a solid home entertainment setup that supports 4K HDR and Atmos surround sound.\nBest OLED TV deals\n\n\n\n\nLG OLED Evo C5 (65-inch) for $1,797 (down from $2,700): LG has steadily improved its C-series over the years, and the C5 Evo is its best model yet. In addition to the usual benefits of OLED, it also sports a brightness booster that can help it work well in bright rooms, as well as LG’s own “Perfect Color” technology. It doesn’t have quantum dots like Sony and Samsung’s OLEDs, but it’s also coming in significantly less than those models. The C5 Evo also has a fast 144Hz refresh rate for gaming, as well as support for NVIDIA’s G-SYNC and AMD FreeSync variable refresh rate technology. (If you’re looking for something larger, the 77-inch model has also been discounted to $2,800.)\nSony Bravia 8 II (65”) QD OLED for $2,998 (down from $3,500): Sony’s top of the line set has everything you’d want in a high-end TV, like quantum dots for improved color and brightness, as well as the inky dark blacks and infinite contrast of a modern OLED panel. You’ll always pay a bit of a premium for Sony TVs, but partially that’s due to their world-class image processing – in this case, that’s handled by Sony’s XR chip. (You can also snag the 55-inch model for $2,500.)\n\nBest Mini LED TV deals\n\n\n\nTCL QM8K (65-inch) QD Mini LED for $1,500 (down from $2,500): TCL's QM8 sets feature the company's best and brightest Mini LED screens with Quantum Dots. It has an ultra-thin bezel, 144Hz refresh rate for fast gaming and one of the best contrast ratios you'll see outside of an OLED screen. Basically, it's one of the best screens you'll find that's not an OLED. While we think the 65-inch model is a great deal for most rooms, you can also step up to the 75-inch for $2,000, the 85-inch for $2,500 and the massive 98-inch set for $3,000. \nTCL QM6K (98-inch) QD Mini LED for $1,800 (down from $3,000 MSRP): The QM6K is one of the best deals we’ve seen on a 98-inch TV under $2,000, and it’s not a low-quality LCD either. It has a bright Mini LED screen with quantum dots for enhanced color, and it sports a fast 144Hz refresh rate for gaming. It’s also a pretty solid Prime Day deal, coming in much lower than the previous $2,200 low price. (If you don’t have the wall space for a nearly 100-inch set, the 65-inch model is similarly great and is down to $550, nearly half off its $1,000 MSRP and $100 off its lowest price. The 75-inch model is also a great deal at $850.)\nSony Bravia 5 (85-inch) Mini LED for $2,298 (down from $2,800): The Bravia 5 pairs a bright Mini LED panel with Sony’s excellent XR image processing chip. It won’t reach the deep dark black levels of OLED, but Mini LED achieves something close, and it can also get much brighter than OLED panels. That makes this model, as well as any Mini LED TV, an excellent option for bright rooms. (You can also scale down to the 65-inch and 75-inch Bravia 5 for $1,300 and $1,800, respectively. And there’s also the truly massive 98-inch model, which is now $1,000 off at $5,000.)\nHisense U7 (75-inch) Mini LED for $750 (down from $900): The Hisense U7 is a great bargain when it comes to Mini LED sets. It offers Quantum Dots, full array local dimming for better contrast and a fast 144Hz gaming mode. It's one of the best options around if you're looking for a large TV that's bigger than 65 inches under $1,000.  \n\nBest Frame-style TV deals\n\n\n\n\nSamsung The Frame (75-inch, 2024) for $1,498 on 7/8 (down from $3,000), $1,699 for the rest of Prime Day week: If you want a TV that doesn't actually look like a TV, the Samsung's Frame sets are the best option. With their painting-like bezels, they can display works of art during your TV-watching downtime. This deal is one of the best we've seen on a large-screen Frame set, and while it's a 2024 model, it still offers a sharp QLED panel, slim wall mounting and an anti-reflective coating to prevent glare. (If you're looking for something smaller, the 65-inch 2024 Frame TV is down to $1,199, and the 55-inch is on sale for $799.)\nSamsung The Frame Pro (65-inch) for $1,899 (down from $2,200): New for 2025, Samsung's Frame Pro sets offer brighter and higher-quality Mini LED panels for a superior TV watching experience. The 65-inch Frame Pro is a great option for most living rooms since it's large enough to deliver an immersive viewing experience, and it also comes with Samsung's wireless One Connect box for less cable clutter. While there's still no OLED Frame TV yet, this Mini LED set is the closest you'll get today. (If you're looking for something larger, the 75-inch Frame Pro is down to $2,699, and the 85-inch is $3,799.) \nHisense S7N CanvasTV (65-inch) for $898 (down from $1,300): Hisense's spin on Samsung's Frame sets, the CanvasTV, comes in much cheaper and with a boatload of features. The S7N sports an anti-glare display and art mode, as you'd expect, but there's also 144Hz support for a bit of gaming. It also comes with a slim wall mount so you can hang it on your wall like a genuine work of art. (The 55-inch model is also a great deal at $689, and the 77-inch is down to $1,399.)   \n\nBest budget TV deals\n\n\n\n\nRoku Smart TV (65-inch) for $350 (down from $450): It's hard to find a decent 65-inch TV under $400, so that alone makes the Roku Smart TV worth a look. It offers Roku's software built-in, supports HDR10 and it also works with a variety of smart speakers, including Alexa and Google Home. Roku's Smart TVs also ship with the company's Enhanced Voice Remote, which makes searching for something to watch a cinch with your voice. (If you're looking for something smaller, the 55-inch model is also a great deal for $250, and the 77-inch is down to $700.) \nAmazon Fire TV (50-inch) for $260 (down from $400): Amazon’s budget Fire TV sets handle the basics just fine, and at this price the 50-inch model is a compelling deal as a second or third TV set. It supports HDR10 (but not Dolby Vision), and as you’d expect, it also has the Amazon Fire TV OS built-in, giving you access to over 23,000 apps. It also sports Amazon’s Alexa Voice Remote to help you find content quickly. (You can also go up and down in size, depending on your needs. The 43-inch model is now down to $220, and it’d be a solid choice for a small bedroom or office.)\nHisense QD6 (55-inch) for $240 (down from $380): Hisense is on a roll delivering tons of TV features at a very low cost, and the QD6 line is a prime example of that. It has Amazon's Fire TV and Alexa support built in, and it also supports Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos. It can even handle a bit of fast gaming with a 120Hz refresh rate.\nTCL QM6K (55-inch) for $448 (down from $600): TCL's mid-range sets finally fall below $500 for Primew Day, and that makes it one of the higher quality options in this price range. The QM6K features a bright Mini LED panel, a 144Hz refresh rate for gaming and it even includes an Onkyo speaker setup built-in.\nRoku Smart TV (32-inch) for $100 (down from $143): Not every room needs a large TV — this Roku Smart TV is perfect for a small bedroom or office. It's powered by Roku's OS and it comes with a Voice Remote. While it only offers a 720p resolution, that will still look decently sharp on a screen this small.\n\nBest soundbar and speaker deals\n\n\n\nSonos Beam Gen 2 for $369 (down from $499): Sonos's latest Beam is one of the best mid-range soundbars on the market. It's compact, but it also delivers expansive sound. And it also supports Dolby Atmos through a bit of speaker virtualization. The Beam is also ideal if you've already got Sonos speakers, since you can pair them all together for some household jams (or just bring your TV audio to different rooms).\nTCL S55H soundbar for $100 (down from $160): At this price, the TCL S55H delivers a ton of audio bang for the buck. It comes with a wireless subwoofer, features auto room calibration and supports virtualized surround sound like Dolby Atmos and DTS Virtual:X. With 220W of power behind its sound, the S55H should be powerful enough to fill most rooms.\nSony Bravia Theater Quad for $2,000 (down from $2,500): Leave it up to Sony to do something different in the world of home entertainment. The Bravia Theater Quad are a set of four flat modules, containing a total of sixteen speakers, which deliver truly enveloping surround sound. They’re the ideal solution for anyone who wants a theatrical experience, but doesn’t want to see gigantic tower or bookshelf speakers in their space. They support Sony’s 360 Spatial Sound Mapping, as well as Dolby Atmos and DTS:X.\nSony Bravia Theater Bar 9 for $998 (down from $1,400): The Bravia Theater Bar 9 is Sony’s most capable self-contained soundbar, with 13 speakers and support for virtualized surround sound with Dolby Atmos, DTS:X and Sony’s own 360 Spatial Sound Mapping technology. It’s the best option if you want to enjoy your favorite movies and music loud, but also don’t want to see speakers all over your living room. (The Bravia Theater 8 is also discounted to $698 and very well-equipped, with 11 speakers and the same surround sound support. )\nSony Bravia Theater System 6 for $568 (down from $770): If you want real surround sound from an actual subwoofer and satellite speakers spread around your room, the Bravia Theater System 6 is a solid choice. It pairs together a compact soundbar, wireless subwoofer and two rear satellites (connected by a wireless amplifier).. It’s a great option for apartments and small living rooms where you just can’t live with virtualized surround sound. (You can also snag the soundbar on its own for $448, down from $650.)\n\nBest streaming deals\n\n\n\nAmazon Fire TV Stick 4K for $25 (down from $50): Amazon’s Fire TV Stick 4K is a simple way to add some streaming smarts to any TV with an HDMI port. Alternatively, you can load it up with your favorite streaming apps and bring it on the road – it sure beats fighting with apps built into hotel or AirBnb TVs. As a bonus, you can also play Xbox cloud streaming games when you pair a controller (Xbox GamePass membership required).\nRoku Ultra for $69 (down from $100): Roku's ultimate set-top box is the best streamer for home theater enthusiasts who want to avoid the more expensive Apple TV. It handles every video and audio format you'd want — including Dolby Vision, Atmos and HDR 10+ — and it also comes with Roku's rechargeable Voice Remote Pro. The Roku Ultra is also the fastest device from the company, so you can expect to zip around Roku's interface and apps far faster than the cheaper streamings sticks.\nRoku Streaming Stick+ for $30 (down from $40): The Roku Streaming Stick+ is the easiest way to bring Roku's robust app selection to any 4K TV. It's a great option for first-generation 4K sets that either had no streaming apps, or are way too slow by now. And it's a great gadgets to bring on trips to maintain access to all of your favorite streaming services.  \nRoku Streaming Stick HD For $20 (down from $30): The basic HD Roku Streaming stick is a solid option for bringing streaming apps to older TVs, which likely don't support 4K or any fancy HDR standards. Sure, it's as no frills as you can get, but for $20 it's worth having a backup streaming device. (or one you won't mind losing during a trip). And if you have an older TV that's still working, it's definitely worth investing a bit to get modern apps.     \nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/best-prime-day-tv-deals-2025-from-sony-lg-samsung-and-others-084705164.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "It's usually wise to wait for Amazon Prime Day to pick up a Kindle ereader since the online retailer typically saves the best deals for its own shopping events. Case in point: this deal on the latest Kindle Scribe. The E Ink tablet is down to $260 right now, which is $140 off and the cheapest we've seen it. You'll get that price on the base 16GB model, but there are similar discounts on the 32GB and 64GB configurations as well.\nThe Kindle Scribe is Amazon's answer to devices like the reMarkable E ink tablet. It's both a standard ereader and a tablet for taking notes, as it ships with a pen for scribbling. This makes it handy for writing down thoughts or for mindlessly drawing pizza slices. Users can jot notes over books, but not every title supports this feature. \n\n\nThe Scribe made our list of the best E Ink tablets for a number of reasons. We appreciated the low latency when writing. In most cases, users won't notice any latency at all. The latest software update also brings in new brush types, which now include a fountain pen, a marker and a pencil. This device makes it easy to create multiple notebooks for different purposes. There are even some AI tools for summarization and the like.\nOf course, it's also a standard ereader. I have a Scribe and, to be honest, I use it primarily for reading. The giant 10.2-inch screen is just so luxe and offers a superior reading experience to standard-sized Kindles. It's a bit heavier and cumbersome to hold for long periods, but that tradeoff is worth it to me.\nThe only major downside here is the price. It's tough to recommend a $400 ereader, even with all of the handwriting bells and whistles. However, this sale certainly takes the edge off a bit.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-latest-kindle-scribe-is-on-sale-for-a-record-low-price-thanks-to-prime-day-131544927.html?src=rss",

The company’s strategy is to raise money via a fundraising round and separately hold a tender offer to allow employees to sell some of their shares to a select group of investors, anonymous sources told Bloomberg. SpaceX typically holds tender offers twice per year. SpaceX’s valuation has steadily climbed since the company was founded more than two decades ago. The company broke the $100 billion valuation mark in October 2021 and doubled that figure just three years later. This latest round would represent a major jump from the $350 billion valuation set during the tender offer held in December 2024. Discussions are still ongoing, and the deal, including the final price, could change."

    "summary": "While you can often find discounts on Echo speakers, Fire tablets, Kindles and other Amazon devices throughout the year, Amazon Prime Day is the best time to buy them, period. Prime Day is basically Black Friday for all Amazon-made gear, provided you’re a Prime member who can actually participate in the members-only shopping event. In recent years, Prime Day discounts on these gadgets have even been better than those we’ve seen during the holiday shopping season. For Amazon Prime Day 2025, you’ll find most of Amazon’s devices on sale for record-low prices (or close to them). These are the best Prime Day deals you can get on Kindles, Fire TVs, Echos and more.\nPrime Day Echo deals\n\n\nEcho Pop speaker for $22 (45 percent off): One of the newer Echo devices available, the Pop it sports a 1.95-inch front-facing speaker and a physical mic mute switch for extra privacy. The Pop also has built-in eero compatibility, so it can extend the area of your home Wi-Fi network if you already have an eero router system. \nEcho Buds for $45 (68 percent off): Amazon's main earbud offering, the Echo Buds are one of our top picks for the best budget wireless earbuds you can get right now. Their design allows some outside sound in, which some will prefer over total noise cancellation, and they have a comfortable design with a pocket-friendly case, automatic wear detection, multi-device connectivity and, of course, built-in Alexa voice controls.\nEcho Show 5 for $60 (33 percent off): This model is one of our favorite smart displays thanks to its compact design, ambient light sensor and sunrise alarm feature, all of which make it an excellent smart alarm clock. Amazon improved the speaker quality on this latest model, which gives sound deeper bass and clearer vocals.\nEcho Show 8 for $110 (27 percent off): This is our current top pick for the best smart display with Amazon’s Alexa thanks in part to its 8-inch touchscreen, 13MP camera that supports auto-framing for better video chats and its built-in Zigbee smart home hub. The 2023 model supports Visual ID, which will show personalized information on the device’s display depending on who’s using it, and video streaming from Netflix, Hulu, Prime Video and other services.\nPrime Day Kindle deals\n\n\nKindle Kids for $95 ($35 off): This is the same device as the base Kindle, but it becomes more kid-friendly thanks to the included cover, two-year warranty and the included year of Amazon Kids+, which gives children ages 3-12 access to hundreds of appropriate ebooks and audiobooks. Just be sure to take note when you activate that subscription because it will renew after one year at the standard $6/month rate.\nKindle Paperwhite for $125 ($35 off): The latest version of the Paperwhite has a seven-inch display, thinner bezels, an adjustable warm light, speedier page turns and a battery that can last up to 12 weeks on a single charge. This model is also IPX8 waterproof and has built-in Audible integration.\nKindle Colorsoft for $180 ($100 off): Amazon's only color e-reader has a seven-inch, high-contrast display, an auto-adjusting front light, a color highlighting feature and an eight-week battery life.\nKindle Scribe for $260 ($140 off): The Scribe is one of the best E-Ink tablets you can buy at the moment, and certainly the top pick if you want a writable table that also excels as an ereader. It provides a great reading and writing experience, thanks in part to its ability to access the entire Kindle ebook library, and it has handy Google Drive, Microsoft OneDrive and Dropbox integration.\nPrime Day Fire TV deals\n\n\nFire TV Stick 4K for $25 (50 percent off): This is the cheapest Fire TV Stick you can get to stream 4K content, plus it has support for Wi-Fi 6 and Dolby Vision and Atmos. With its live picture-in-picture feature, you can view security camera feeds right on your TV while you’re watching your favorite show or movie.\nFire TV Stick 4K Max for $35 (42 percent off): In addition to 4K HDR streaming with Dolby Vision and Atmos support, the 4K Max dongle includes Wi-Fi 6E connectivity, 16GB of built-in storage and live picture-in-picture capabilities. It also supports the Fire TV “ambient experience,” which lets you display photos and images on your TV screen when you’re not actively watching something.\nFire TV Cube streaming box for $90 (36 percent off): This model will provide the best performance of any Fire TV streaming device, and it supports 4K HDR content, Dolby Vision and Atmos and an enhanced version of the Alexa Voice Remote. Along with live picture-in-picture view and the Fire TV ambient experience, you can also hardware other devices to the Fire TV Cube including a cable box or a game console.\nPrime Day Fire tablet deals\n\n\nFire HD 8 tablet for $55 (45 percent off): This is Amazon's most bare-bones tablet, featuring an eight-inch HD touchscreen, hexa-core processor and 13 hours of battery life. The improvements in the screen quality alone from the old-school Fire 7 tablet make it a better buy for most people, and this slab would make a good couch device for general web browsing, email checking, online shopping and more.\nFire Max 11 tablet for $140 (39 percent off): Amazon’s most powerful tablet, the Fire Max 11 sports an 11-inch 2,000 x 1,200 touchscreen, an octa-core processor, up to 128GB of storage and 14 hours of battery life. It also works with a number of optional accessories, including a stylus and keyboard case.\nFire HD 10 Kids tablet for $105 (45 percent off): This slab is designed for kids aged three to seven, with full parental controls plus one year of Amazon Kids+ for free with the tablet purchase. This model has a 10-inch FHD touchscreen, an octa-core processor and 13 hours of battery life, plus it comes with a two-year warranty and a protective case.\nFire HD 10 Kids Pro tablet for $105 (45 percent off): This model is designed for kids aged six to 12 and comes with a slimmer protective case, a two-year warranty and one year of access to Amazon Kids+. Otherwise, you get a very similar experience here that you would with the non-Pro version, including parental controls, a 10-inch touchscreen, solid performance and a 13-hour battery life.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-prime-day-deals-on-amazon-devices-save-on-kindle-ereaders-echo-speakers-and-more-082012377.html?src=rss",

Read more: Netflix Review: Our Top Pick in a Sea of Streaming Choices As you should expect, the game was filled with copious amounts of bloodshed, back-stabbing and drama. And as you can probably imagine, all these feedings lead to frequent diaper changes, too. Aside from the fact that active trauma can cause a woman's body to go into fight-or-flight mode, and make an active (and natural, for that matter) childbirth a more time-consuming and challenging process -- my wife, for instance, was in labor for four days -- I was suddenly watching characters reconcile the constant fear of being killed with the fact that they have new life on their hands. It brought me a weird mix of pleasure and disappointment to learn my prediction was right. Now, David Fincher's US spin-off is on the docket to keep this world alive."

    "full_text": "It’s a great time to buy a new TV during Amazon Prime Day (or, days, rather), but that doesn’t mean you should only consider 2025 models. If you want to go with something even bigger, Amazon and Best Buy have the 77-inch model for just under $1,800. The Samsung S90D is a QD-OLED, which uses quantum dots on top of an OLED layer to create a brighter and more color-vibrant image than traditional OLED designs. Samsung has also invested in making all of its TVs, the S90D included, great for gaming. Modern consoles can go up to 120Hz — don’t blame Samsung, it’s a console limitation. There are some frustrations with the S90D you should consider before buying. Some niche apps, such as F1 TV, are not available on Tizen. The S90D doesn’t support Dolby Vision, instead opting for HDR10+ as a dynamic HDR format. The S90F’s minor improvements don’t justify their significant price difference. Unless you’re incredibly susceptible to FOMO, the S90D is a much better purchase during Prime Day."

    "summary": "If you’ve been holding out on a new set of earbuds or headphones during Prime Day, now’s a great time to take a look at the deals. While Sony and Bose are typically among our favorites each year, there are a number of options available at discounted prices right now. Whether you prefer over-ear headphones or true wireless earbuds, the list of deals accounts for both styles and includes a range of prices. Plus, we’ll guide you through the fray with the best features of each model so you’re not left sorting out the spec sheet by yourself.\nPrime Day Sony deals\n\n\nSony WH-1000XM6 headphones for $430 ($20 off): Sony's latest flagship headphones have only been out a few months and we're already seeing a small discount on them. These are my top pick in our headphones guide for the combination of advanced features, comfy fit, great sound and improved active noise cancellation (ANC).  \nSony ULT Wear headphones for $130 ($70 off): If you're after a solid set of Sony cans but don't want to splurge for the 1000X line, the ULT Wear is a good option. There are a bunch of handy features and robust sound with ULT bass boost.\nSony WH-CH720N headphones for $80 ($70 off): The cheapest Sony headphones we'd recommend for Prime Day are no slouch. They're lightweight and comfy with respectable sound for the price. You also get Adaptive Sound Control, 360 Reality Audio and multipoint Bluetooth on this budget model. \nSony WF-1000XM5 earbuds for $200 ($100 off): My top pick for best earbuds is also on sale for Prime Day. No other company comes close to the list of features Sony offers here, and that's on top of excellent sound, improved fit and effective ANC. \nSony LinkBud Fit earbuds for $130 ($70 off): Sony's much smaller earbuds offer big sound and a lot of features for less than the 1000X model. These are a big improvement over the company's LinkBuds S, which were already a low-key hit for affordable earbuds.\nSony WF-CH710N earbuds for $80 ($40 off): The CH710N is still quite new, but the earbuds are a steal at $80 for Prime Day. The compact, comfy design is a highlight, as are all the features Sony managed to pack in. Plus, they're available in a lovely transparent blue that allows you to see all of the internal components. \nSonos Prime Day deals\n\n\nPrime Day Bose deals (also available at Bose.com)\n\n\nBose QuietComfort Earbuds for $129 (28 percent off): The best Bose earbuds for most people are getting a decent discount this week.

You also get spatial audio and dependable battery life in this affordable option.\nBose Ultra Open Earbuds for $239 (20 percent off): If you thought Bose's clip-on open earbuds were a bit too pricey to splurge on, now's your chance to get them for less. Plus, this model works with the company's soundbars for an enhanced living room listening experience. \nBeats Prime Day deals\n\n\nBeats Solo 4 headphones for $100 (50 percent off): Beats' popular on-ear headphones are half off for Prime Day, which makes them a great deal for fans of that wear style. While they may look similar to their predecessor, the Solo 4 have improved sound and longer battery life compared to that older model.\nBeats Powerbeats Pro 2 earbuds for $180 (28 percent off): Apple's first earbuds with heart rate tracking are slightly discounted for Prime Day. This your chance to try the tech without paying full price. What's more, the Powerbeats Pro 2 have an improved design, the smarts of Apple's H2 chip and powerful bass. \nPrime Day Samsung deals\n\n\nSamsung Galaxy Buds FE for $52 (48 percent off): Samsung's budget earbuds are solid option if you're looking to spend less than $60. Like the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro, these are best-suited for Samsung devices where you'll find features like live translation and automatic switching.\nApple and Google Prime Day deals\nApple AirPods Pro 2 for $149 (40 percent off): The best AirPods you can buy are at their lowest price this year during Prime Day. In addition to hands-free Siri, this model supports advanced features like Apple's hearing test and hearing aid tool, in addition to hearing protection and more. \nApple AirPods 4 for $89 (31 percent off): The redesigned \"regular\" AirPods that debuted last year are currently available well below their normal $129 price tag. Here, you'll get the new, more comfortable shape as well as updated features. \nApple AirPods 4 with ANC for $119 (34 percent off): And if you need some ANC to go with your AirPods, but don't want to go for the Pro 2, here's your best bet.

They're comfy and offer a lot of handy features for Apple devices.

How do you earn a $200 Amazon gift card with the Prime Visa? Most cards require you to spend a certain amount in the first few months of account ownership to \"earn\" a bonus, but the Prime Visa card doesn't. Amazon's flagship card is a great all-around rewards card, since it offers 5% back on travel booked through Chase and 2% back at gas stations, restaurants and rideshare services. Checking out on Amazon is certainly convenient, but I also like to shop small. But this card only makes sense if you're a Prime member and regular Amazon shopper. It's not as rewarding but has no annual fee and comes with a $50 gift card on approval. There's also the Blue Cash Everyday Card from American Express, which has no annual fee and offers rewards with select US online retailers, including Amazon. For rates and fees of the Blue Cash Preferred Card from American Express, click here. *All information about the Prime Visa and Wells Fargo Active Cash card has been collected independently by CNET and has not been reviewed by the issuer."

    "full_text": "The Absolute was able to remove 68.3% of sand from low-pile and 52% from mid-pile carpets, falling short of many competitors, including the Levoit LVAC-200 and Shark Stratos. Dyson V11 Torque Drive: With a motor that automatically adapts to the type of floor it's cleaning and a fancy LCD screen, the Dyson V11 Torque Drive might feel like an upgrade. Shark Rocket Pet Pro: Typically retailing for less than $350, the Shark Rocket Pet Pro remains a solid budget option provided you can find it in stock. Tineco A11 Hero (Update: Out of stock): The Tineco A11 Hero is no longer available but it was a solid and reasonably affordable cordless vacuum when we tested it. Versatile attachments, HEPA filtration and a dirt-detection feature add to its value. Tineco does great work with cordless vacs and the Pure One S15 Pet is fantastic. A 500-watt motor and cyclonic dust collection system creates 120AW of suction power. Moosoo XL-618: It wasn't a strong performer in our toughest tests, but the Mooso XL-618 proved perfectly capable of basic cleaning, particularly with crumbs and on hardwood floors. Black & Decker PowerSeries Extreme Max: The Black & Decker PowerSeries Extreme Max is a budget-friendly cordless vacuum that offers strong cleaning performance and a long runtime. Priced about $400, it did great in our testing on hardwood, scoring nearly 98% sand removal."

But as iffy as WBD’s bet on Gunn seemed at first, his new Superman film is a shining example of what all the studio is capable of when the right creatives are in charge. It assumes you know most of the basics about its titular hero, but knows that there are weird little pieces of his lore you probably aren’t familiar with and will be delighted to learn about. Though Superman (David Corenswet) is a known quantity in this world who has been saving people from disasters for a bit of time, very few people know that he is also bumbling journalist Clark Kent. There are a couple of clever reasons that most folks don’t recognize Clark when he takes off his glasses. But the duality of his identity is something that Daily Planet reporter Lois Lane (Rachel Brosnahan) understands well. But with Metropolis constantly being attacked by aliens and monsters, the people in Clark’s life – aside from Lois – don’t really have the mental bandwidth to put two and two together to realize that he’s a superpowered man from another planet. Lex would never admit it, but he’s also just kind of a Superman stan whose desire to kill the last son of Krypton is rooted in a deep insecurity that Lex’s girlfriend Eve Teschmacher (Sara Sampaio) can’t fix. The Justice Gang are only a couple of people, and so when a kaiju of Lex’s making starts tearing through Metropolis, Superman is the only person around who can do anything about it. Superman also makes very clear that its world is very populated by different kinds of metahumans — some of whom are destined to become heroes, while others like the Engineer (María Gabriela de Faría) are dead set on being murderous villains."

Let's dive a little deeper into the main considerations, starting with our performance tests. To find out, we use sand as an analog for finer particles. It tends to be more challenging for robot vacuums (though again, not always). From there, we repeat each run two more times and average the results. We now use the sand test as our primary benchmark in evaluating cleaning performance. We consider anything 50% and above to be a good score for sand. The ideal cleaner will make easy work of finding its way from room to room and automatically avoiding obstacles along the way, all of which makes for proper, low-maintenance automated cleaning. In contrast, we have a robot vacuum with bad navigation, the Noesis Florio. Over the years, we've consistently noted that robot vacuums that use laser-guided lidar navigation tend to be very good at mapping their environment and finding their way around."

Foreseeing how much rain is likely to fall, and then figuring out the flow of that water on land, are both complicated tasks. The size of raindrops falling, along with wind speed and direction, are also contributing factors. Progress hinges on more advanced computer modeling and a better understanding of how precipitation forms in clouds. The type of terrain it falls on — whether it’s sandy or rocky soil or an urban area with a lot of impervious concrete that prevents the ground from soaking up water, for instance — makes a difference. So that’s very little time to warn people or do anything about it,” Meier says. “Essentially, at 1:10 am the river was a tranquil almost dry riverbed, and by 4:30 am it was a raging flood with more water flowing than the average flow over Niagara Falls,” meteorologist Alan Gerard wrote in his Balanced Weather blog on July 5th. The NWS issued a flood watch Thursday at 1:18PM to notify people that heavy rainfall could cause flash flooding across portions of eight counties in south-central Texas. A global Flash Flood Guidance System that helped other countries develop their own warning systems lost funding when DOGE dismantled USAID. “People should take this more seriously and there absolutely shouldn’t be cuts in funding for research.”"

Underwater, however, they've been quietly making a substantial contribution to slowing global warming. The BBC reported on the latest research into zooplankton by an international team, published in the journal Limnology and Oceanography, that detailed just how much these tiny critters have been impacting the planet's temperature.\nIn the spring and summer time, the animals consume phytoplankon, which are photosynthesizing bacteria and organisms that live on the ocean's surface. After gorging themselves on this feast, zooplankton descend into the deeper waters around Antarctica to hibernate and burn off the fat created by eating phytoplankon, which releases carbon dioxide. This behavior has had the added benefit of storing carbon hundreds of meters underwater, where it can take decades or sometimes centuries to re-emerge and add to warming the atmosphere. \n\"If this biological pump didn't exist, atmospheric CO2 levels would be roughly twice those as they are at the moment,\" co-author Professor Angus Atkinson from Plymouth Marine Laboratory told the BBC. \"So the oceans are doing a pretty good job of mopping up CO2 and getting rid of it.\"\nIt was already known that zooplankton played a role in facilitating carbon storage, but the new results detailed just how effective these aquatic critters have been in helping slow the planet's warming. They said zooplankton are responsible for transporting 65 million tons of carbon each year to the depths of the Southern Ocean. That's the equivalent of a year's emissions from 55 million diesel cars.\nBut since we seem incapable of having nice things, zooplankon are also at long-term risk. The climate change that they have been helping to stave off poses a threat to these species in the form of higher water temperatures, disturbances to ocean layers and extreme weather events. There's also an industry for krill harvesting; according to the UN, about 500,000 tons of krill were removed from the ocean by commercial operations in 2020. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/science/we-have-a-surprising-underwater-ally-in-combatting-climate-change-zooplankton-190613506.html?src=rss",

If you’re interested, here are links to the console and Mario Kart World bundle and the console on its own. It’s a big change following Nintendo removing listings for its products from Amazon starting last year. Bloomberg reported in June that Nintendo pulled the listings because third-party sellers sold games at prices “that undercut Nintendo’s advertised rates.” Nintendo and Amazon pushed back on Bloomberg’s report in statements to the publication but didn’t go into specifics. However, there have been signs that something had changed between Nintendo and Amazon, with Switch 2 games like Donkey Kong Bananza, Super Mario Party Jamboree, and Kirby and the Forgotten Land all recently getting official Amazon product pages. If you request an Amazon invite, the product page will show a message saying that “if invited to purchase, you’ll get an email with a link that’s valid for 22 hours. We won’t be able to grant all requests.” I got an email notifying me about my request, too. If you are still looking for a console and Amazon doesn’t come through, retailers like Walmart and Best Buy have occasional restocks."

Those plans don't come with data caps or prescheduled price increases after one year, making them an excellent option -- if they're available at your address. Unlike the latest smartphone, laptop, router or kitchen tool, it’s impractical to personally test every ISP in a given city. ISP plans and prices are subject to frequent changes; all information provided is accurate as of publication. Select locations in the Miami area are wired for Google Fiber Webpass, a high-speed fixed wireless internet service."

    "summary": "Even the most affordable Kindle usually has a $110 MSRP, so holding out for the best Prime Day Kindle deals Amazon offers makes a lot of sense. Right now, nearly every Kindle Amazon sells is seeing discounts — and a couple are hitting the best prices we’ve seen since this year. Just note that in past sales, we've seen most of the Kindle deals end when the sale does (that's July 11 in this case). A Engadget, we’ve reviewed every current model: the Paperwhite, the Colorsoft, the Scribe and the basic Kindle. So check out our reviews before you buy. We’ve also included a few of the best Prime Day deals on non-Kindle ereaders, which you’ll find in our ereader guide. Here are the best Prime Day Kindle deals we could find.\n\n\nBest Prime Day deals on Kindle ereaders\n\n\nAmazon Kindle for $85 ($25 off with Prime): The base model Kindle is our recommendation for the best budget ereader. Even when it’s not on sale, it’s the most affordable e-book device from a major manufacturer. It’s compact and durable making it easy to carry. It doesn’t have warm LEDs and it’s not waterproof but it’s the most affordable way to access Amazon’s vast e-book ecosystem. \nKindle Colorsoft for $180 ($100 off with Prime): Amazon didn’t introduce color to its ereader lineup until early this year — long after Kobo and Boox. The list price of $280 makes it more expensive than other color display ereaders, but this discount helps with that. We appreciate the fast page turns, pinch to zoom feature and auto-adjusting warm front light.\nKindle Scribe 2 for $260 ($140 off with Prime): If you want a Kindle that lets you write as well as read, this is the one to get. We gave the Kindle Scribe 2 a score of 86 in our review and it’s our pick for the best e-reader E Ink tablet. It has a smooth reading and writing experience with low latency. It also lets you create multiple notebooks, add pages and change the templates easily.\nKindle Paperwhite for $125 ($35 off with Prime): The Paperwhite is an elevated version of the Kindle, with a larger, seven-inch, flush-front screen and an adjustable warm front light. A faster processor gives it quicker page turns than its predecessor and the device itself is waterproof.\nKindle Paperwhite Signature Edition for $150 ($50 off with Prime): The Signature Edition adds few more premium features to the Kindle Paperwhite with wireless charging, an auto-adjusting front light and more storage (32GB). We gave it an 85 in our review praising the premium build, remarkably clear text and fast page turns. We just wish the power button wasn’t on the bottom.\nKindle Kids for $95 ($35 off with Prime): The Kindle Kids edition is the same hardware as the standard Kindle, but you get a few added perks that are fitting for younger users. To start, a case comes standard. The warranty is extended to two years. And the purchase price includes a six month subscription to Amazon Kids+ for thousands of kid-friendly ebooks and more.\nKindle Paperwhite Kids for $130 ($50 off with Prime): Again, the kids version is the same as the Paperwhite but with a cover, extended warranty and access to Amazon Kids+ for six months. Just remember to cancel at the end of the trial or keep it and pay $6 per month.\nBest Prime Day deals on non-Kindle ereaders\nBoox Palma 2 for $270 ($30 off): This smartphone-shaped device is a delight. It’s built on Android and can run just about any app you can download from the Play Store — just don’t expect it to play video or graphics-intensive games. This is an E Ink screen, after all. But it’s perfect for reading books and running simple apps in a more eye-friendly format.\nKobo Libra Color for $210 ($40 off): Our favorite ereader with buttons has a premium, waterproof build that’s very comfortable to hold. The touch controls and buttons are responsive and deeply customizable. The color display brings more life to book covers and graphic novels, and it’s even stylus-enabled if you want to scribble on your books. This is the lowest price in a few months, but note that it dropped to $200 in January.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-prime-day-kindle-deals-and-ereader-sales-080957865.html?src=rss",

    "full_text": "His work has appeared in The New York Daily News and City & State. A key pillar of post-9/11 airport security theater may finally be going away. Multiple outlets are reporting that the Transportation Security Administration will start allowing passengers at a few select airports to keep their shoes on while going through security checkpoints. No longer will we have to gaze upon our fellow travelers’ weird socks or — god forbid — bare feet while waiting in a security line. Previously only passengers with TSA Pre-Check were able to keep their shoes on in most cases. The TSA has required most travelers to remove their shoes since 2006, five years after failed shoe bomber Richard Reid tried to ignite 10-ounces of explosives in his shoes on an American Airlines flight from Paris to Miami. The agency said that despite the failed attempt, intelligence suggested that others may attempt a copycat bombing — and thus we’ve all been forced to endure the humiliation of walking across cold airport floors in just our socks ever since. Security theater is the practice of implementing measures designed to give the appearance of making things safer, despite doing very little to achieve that. “It’s like saying, Last time the terrorists wore red shirts, so now we’re going to ban red shirts,” Bruce Schneier, a cryptographer, computer security professional, and privacy specialist, told Vanity Fair in 2011. Please read the TSA’s full humiliating history by Darryl Campbell to learn more."

Several video game news outlets reported on the story and noted that several players complained on social media that they had been hacked while playing the game. Until now, there had not been a confirmed link between the two events. “The game is not safe to play on PC right now, there’s an RCE exploit,” a player wrote on Reddit last week, referring to a type of bug known as remote code execution, which allows hackers the ability to plant malware capable of essentially taking control of a victim’s device.

    "summary": "Amazon’s Prime Day is here, and it's shaping up to be a good good opportunity for Prime Members to save on products from every department — particularly kitchen tech. We have quite a few food-enthusiasts on staff at Engadget, and most of us have tried out at least a few cooking gadgets, all in the name of eating, er, journalistic discovery. Right now, many of the kitchen gadgets and accessories we recommend are on sale — some at the best prices we’ve seen yet this year. So if you’re in the market for a new Instant Pot, a Breville oven, an Anova sous vide machine or a Ninja air fryer, check out our list of the best Prime Day deals on kitchen tech below.\nEditor's note: We've been anxiously waiting to see if Ninja's Creami ice cream maker would go on sale. Right now, a bundle with extra containers is selling for $200, but that's still well above the low of $160 we saw as recently as January. We'll continue to monitor the sale and will update this guide if the price goes lower.  \nPrime Day air fryer deals\n\n\nBreville Smart Oven Air Fryer Pro for $320 ($80 off): This is the premium pick in our air fryer guide — but really, it does far more than just air fry. As our reviewer noted, its massive cubic-foot-capacity and numerous cook modes make this more like an auxiliary oven. (It can even cook an entire 14-pound turkey.) It went on sale for $300 during last year's Black Friday sales. \nNinja Foodie Dual Zone Air Fryer (10 QT) for $180 ($70 off): This is the air fryer to pick if you’ve ever wished you could air fry two different things at the same time. We named it the best dual-zone air fryer you can get — it even has a feature that makes sure the two different foods are ready at the same time.\nInstant Vortex Plus Air Fryer (6 QT) for $100 ($70 off): After studious testing (and dutiful eating) our reviewers named this one the best air fryer you can buy. And, after reading that assessment, I bought one myself so I can verify this is one great machine. The Odor Ease tech really does keep the cooking smells at bay and the window lets me keep an eye on all the crisping that’s going on in there.\nInstant Pot Vortex Plus Air Fryer (4QT) for $65 ($65 off with Prime): Here’s a smaller version of the Instant air fryer we named best overall. It has a four-quart capacity, which is perfect for one person and small kitchens. And, like its larger sibling, pre-heats quickly.\nNinja Air Fryer (4 QT) for $80 ($50 off): The budget pick from our air fryer guide isn’t currently on sale, but this four-quart Ninja fryer has twice the capacity and is nearly the same price. It can also roast and dehydrate in addition to air frying and reheating.\nPrime Day Instant Pot and rice cooker deals\n\n\nCuckoo Twin Pressure Rice Cooker for $190 ($70 off with Prime): This is the best premium rice cooker in our guide to those machines. We like how quickly it cooks all types of rice to perfection (we tested it with long-grain white basmati, brown and sushi-grade white rice). Just keep in mind that it can be a little difficult to clean and the manual isn’t the most user-friendly.\nHamilton Beach Digital Programmable Rice Cooker for $40 ($10 off with Prime): Our top pick for a budget rice cooker is on sale for Prime members. The brown rice came out particularly good in our tests and the cooker is easy to clean with a dishwasher-safe cooker pot and steamer basket. Just note that it’s pretty small and doesn’t have the granular controls of pricer models.\nPrime Day kitchen tech deals\n\n\nNinja CREAMi Ice Cream Maker for $200 ($30 off): We said this machine “makes your frozen dreams come true.” It’s easy to use and makes thick, dense ice cream with flavors that are more intense and textures that are smoother than rival ice cream makers. Plus most of the parts are machine washable or easily rinsed. This bundle comes with extra containers and is the lowest price we’ve seen in a few months, but note that the Creami sold for $160 as recently as January.\nBreville Joule Turbo Sous Vide Machine for $200 ($50 off): The premium pick in our guide to sous vice machines has a powerful 1,100-watt heater that cuts down on cooking times. It also uses your phone as the controller (just don’t get it if you’re hoping for on-device buttons).\nAnova Sous Vide Cooker 3.0 for $145 (37 percent off): Our top pick for a sous vide machine delivers 1,100 watts of power and a flow rate of eight liters per minute which will get your water up to the right temperature faster. It also has intuitive digital touch controls and Wi-Fi connectivity.\nOoni Volt 12 Electric Indoor Pizza Oven for $630 ($269 off): This is our pick for the best indoor pizza oven — but it can be used outdoors as well thanks to its weather-resistant design. It has front-mounted controls that let you individually control the upper and lower heating elements and it can get up to 850 degrees Fahrenheit in as little as 20 minutes. Other Ooni ovens are on sale, too. \nBreville Juice Fountain Plus for $120 ($60 off with Prime): The extraction abilities on this machine are impressive. Plus we found it relatively easy to clean (as long as you do it right after you juice). It takes up a good amount of space, but can extract an impressive amount of juice from even the driest-seeming carrot. This is the lowest price in a while, but it went down to $110 in January.\nVitamix E310 Explorian Blender for $330 ($50 off): Note that we've seen this go for as little as $255 in past sales, and it dropped to $300 as recently as May. But this is still a decent $50 discount on a blender that will make any food you put in it smooth. We recommend it in our guide to the best kitchen tech.  \nKitchenAid Classic Series (4.5 QT) for $300 ($50 off): Prime Day and Black Friday sales are usually the best times to snag Kitchen Aid’s iconic mixers — unfortunately, this discount isn’t even as good as the $250 it sold for in May. Still you can save $50 on a classic appliance that we recommend in our guide to essential kitchen gadgets. These mixers are durable, reliable and, with the wide range of attachments, can truly expand your cooking arsenal.\nVitamix 5200 Blender Professional-Grade for $350 ($150 off with Prime): I can personally attest to the nearly magical abilities of Vitamix blenders. It can make chunky salsas, smooth-as-silk soups and smoothies in which the chia and hemp seeds seem to disappear into the fruit. This pro-grade model is down to the lowest price we’ve tracked this year.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/amazon-prime-day-deals-on-kitchen-essentials-include-up-to-50-percent-off-on-air-fryers-instant-pots-and-sous-vide-machine-180019437.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Amazon Prime Day has been a summer mainstay for a long time, so much so that it’s spawned a bunch of other sale events that compete with it. Case in point: Walmart Deals 2025. Yes, Walmart’s anti-Prime Day sale is back again this year, and it includes discounts across a slew of categories including tech and gadgets.\nEngadget covers all of the best Prime Day deals you can get, but we’re aware that not everyone pays for Prime and not everyone wants to do the bulk of their shopping at Amazon. But that doesn’t mean you should miss out on some good tech deals. Walmart is actually matching some of the best Prime Day deals this year, and so you can save on some of our favorite gear without needing to go through Amazon to do it. Here, we’ve collected the best Walmart Deals savings we could find, and we’ll continue to update this post throughout the event as we discover new discounts.\nBest Walmart Deals 2025 discounts\nSamsung 32-inch Smart Monitor M5 for $199 ($100 off): Not only will this be a good monitor for your home office setup, but it also acts as a full smart TV, too. Its interface gives you access to platforms like Netflix, Prime Video, YouTube and others, and it also comes with a SmartThings IoT hub built in so you can connect and control things like smart lights directly from the monitor.\nSamsung Galaxy Watch 6 for $129 (47 percent off): While it's an older model, we generally like Samsung Galaxy Watches and they're arguably the best smartwatches for Samsung phone users. The Galaxy Watch 6 has good all-day activity tracking and sleep monitoring, plus heart rate tracking, personalized health insights and more.\nApple MacBook Air (13-inch, M1) for $599 ($50 off): The M1 Air has been long gone from Apple's own site, but it's still a more than capable laptop for anyone looking for a solid, all-purpose machine. We still recommend springing for an M3 or M4 machine instead, but if you're on a budget, this deal will be hard to beat.\nSony WH-1000XM5 headphones for $298 ($102 off): While the XM6 headphones are the latest and greatest, they only make small changes to the already stellar XM5. These were our top pick for the best wireless headphones for a long time before the XM6 launched earlier this year, and we still like them for their excellent sound quality, strong ANC, multi-device connectivity and good battery life.\nRoku Express HD streaming device for $17 ($12 off): If you're simply looking for an affordable streamer to upgrade an aging TV, the Roku Express HD could fit the bill. It plays HD-quality content and gives you access to every major streaming platform including HBO Max, Disney+, Prime Video and others. It'll tuck away behind your set nicely and it supports headphone mode, which lets you connect headphones to the Roku mobile app for private listening and viewing from your TV.\nGoogle TV Streamer 4K for $84 ($16 off): Our top favorite streaming device, the Google TV Streamer 4K is basically a souped-up Chromecast with 4K content support, an easy to use interface and a great remote control.\nHisense 75-inch U6H ULED 4K smart TV for $448 (36 percent off): This Quantum Dot TV can reach 600 nits at peak brightness across its 48 local dimming zones. It supports Dolby Vision and Atmos, HDMI 2.1 inputs for a better gaming experience and it has the Google Assistant built in for voice control.\nRazer Kraken Hello Kitty & Friends Bluetooth headset for $47 (47 percent off): Razer makes excellent gaming accessories and this Hello Kitty & Friends version of the popular Kraken headset might be just what you were looking for to add more personality into your Twitch stream outfits. Aside from the cute design, it supports Bluetooth 5.0, comes with 40mm drivers and sports a beamforming microphone.\nMSI Thin A15 gaming laptop (15.6-inch, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD) for $649 (37 percent off): Along with a Ryzen processor, this MSI gaming laptop sports a NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060 GPU and a 144Hz screen, and it comes in at just about 4 pounds in weight.\nPlayStation 5 Slim Astro Bot bundle for $453 ($106 off): This version of the console has a disc drive and comes with 1TB of storage, plus the ever-popular Astro Bot game.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/walmart-deals-2025-are-live-with-a-bunch-of-anti-prime-day-sales-to-shop-now-230146548.html?src=rss",

But that doesn’t mean you should miss out on some good tech deals. Walmart is actually matching some of the best Prime Day deals this year, and so you can save on some of our favorite gear without needing to go through Amazon to do it. Samsung 32-inch Smart Monitor M5 for $199 ($100 off): Not only will this be a good monitor for your home office setup, but it also acts as a full smart TV, too. We still recommend springing for an M3 or M4 machine instead, but if you're on a budget, this deal will be hard to beat.

    "full_text": "Attila Tomaschek, CNET's software senior writer and digital security expert, said that's not a bad thing, though. \"Passwords can be cracked, whereas passkeys need both the public and the locally stored private key to authenticate users, which can help mitigate risks like falling victim to phishing and brute-force or credential-stuffing attacks,\" Tomaschek said. Passkeys get rid of the risky password habits practiced by 49% of US adults, like using the same password for multiple accounts or using personal hints, according to a CNET survey. However, those convenient hints can pose a bigger risk to scammers, identity theft and fraud. Microsoft Authenticator houses your passwords and lets you sign into all your Microsoft accounts using a PIN, facial recognition like Windows Hello, or other biometric data like a fingerprint. Authenticator can be used in other ways, such as verifying you're logging in if you forgot your password, or using two-factor authentication as an extra layer of security for your accounts. In June, the company stopped letting users add passwords to Authenticator. Starting this month, you won't be able to use the autofill password function. And next month, you'll no longer be able to use saved passwords. \"Passkeys use public key cryptography to authenticate users, rather than relying on users themselves creating their own (often weak or reused) passwords to access their online accounts,\" Tomaschek said."

    "full_text": "If you want to save money, take a look at picks from well-known brands for $30 and below. Indoor security cams are less likely to have their own lights or other sources of illumination nearby save dim nightlights. Motion detection turns on the camera only when it detects movement, especially movement by humans, so it’s a necessary feature to save on video storage and battery life. Detection pairs well with alerts for your phone while away from home, but you'll want smart alerts that can recognize people or specific situations like alarms, pets barking, etc. Indoor cameras work particularly well with voice commands like, “Turn off camera,” or “Show me living room camera view.” Good cams work with Google Home, Google Assistant and Alexa, but they’re harder to find, and Apple Home models are even tougher to locate. Matter (the smart home standard) compatibility is also important, and you can read more about that in our guides, but it doesn’t apply to security cams because the protocol hasn't expanded to video footage yet. If you do already have a home security system from a brand like Abode, ADT or Frontpoint, you should look for an indoor cam that's compatible with that app or control panel. The Blink Mini's small design requires a certain amount of care when installing. Others like features such as intelligent tracking, lots of zoom options and a built-in siren. You don’t want a data breach putting your privacy at risk, or worse bugs like the video caching issue that let Wyze users accidentally see out of other people’s cameras."

It operates quietly and doesn’t rely on Wi-Fi, so there’s no need to deal with a smartphone app. Instead, you can control it directly using the onboard button or the included remote, which also lets you set cleaning schedules for added convenience (and remotely steer it, in case it’s not getting the spots you want it to get)."

Samsung is also offering deals for up to $1,200 off when you reserve the new foldable phones on its website. Noted leaker and blogger Evan Blass shared photos in his newsletter of the Galaxy Z Fold 7. The camera bump sticks out quite a bit and gives off heavy Galaxy S25 Edge vibes. And like Motorola, Samsung could have not one but two Z Flip phones this year. Luckily, Blass also shared leaked photos of the Z Flip 7 in blue shadow, coral red and jet black. A couple of weeks ago Samsung launched its Exynos 2500 processor, and that could be what powers the Galaxy Z Flip 7. A few weeks back, Dr. Hon Pak, Samsung's senior vice president and head of digital health, talked with CNET's Vanessa Hand Orellana about the company's plans around its wearables, which are geared toward personalized coaching, monitoring signs of aging and a new blood analysis feature you can use right from your wrist, no needle necessary. The update is part of a broader push to help people fend off chronic illness. There's no word on pricing, but it's great to see Samsung really transform its watches with more of these wellness and health features."

    "summary": "Summer is a great time to play games because no matter how hot it is outside, you can chill inside with your favorite titles and explore all sorts of virtual worlds. But even when you have a big backlog of titles to chew through, if your gaming machine and accessories aren't on point, it might feel like you aren't really maximising your entertainment time. So in order to help you upgrade your setup during Amazon Prime Day, we've combed through hundreds of products ranging from controllers to battery packs, headphones, memory cards and more to figure out the best deals around.\nBest Prime Day deals on video games\n\n\nStar Wars Outlaws - Limited Edition (Amazon Exclusive), PlayStation 5 for $29 ($31 off) \nAt full price, this game was easy to skip. But now that it's available for just $29 (half off its normal retail price), Star Wars Outlaws suddenly becomes a lot more interesting for fans of the franchise. You get to live out your dreams of being an intergalactic scoundrel while taking down bounties or battling secret crime syndicates. And because this is the limited edition, the game includes some pre-order rewards like the Kessel Run bonus pack and the Rogue Infiltrator bundle.\nAssassin’s Creed Shadows - Limited Edition for PS5/Xbox Series X for $48 ($22 off)\nIf you missed the latest entry in Ubisoft's most well-known franchise, this might be the time to jump in because for Prime Day, Assassin's Creed Shadows is available for $48, more than $20 off its regular retail price. This instalment has you explore feudal Japan as either the shinobi Naoe or the legendary samurai Yasuke while encountering some notable figures from the time period. If all you want is a wonderful world to sneak around in, it's hard to go wrong with Assassin's Creed on a discount.\nElden Ring: Shadow of The Erdtree Edition for PS5/Xbox Series X for $60 ($20 off)\nElden Ring is one of the most highly regarded games of this decade so far (and arguably of all time). For Prime Day, you can become a foul tarnished by picking up a version that includes the base game and the Shadow of the Erdtree expansion for $60. Elden Ring typically costs around $50 (though it's down to $30 on PS4, PS5 and Xbox Series X for Prime Day) and the DLC will usually run you another $40, so that's a decent discount compared with buying them separately — or even the Shadow of the Erdtree Edition at its regular price. \nFinal Fantasy I-VI Collection Anniversary Edition for PlayStation and Switch for $45 ($30 off, lowest ever price)\nThis collection of pixel remasters of the first six Final Fantasy games is an absolute steal at $45 during Prime Day. It's the lowest price we've seen to date for this set, which comes with a nice little sticker sheet of character sprites. Several other games in the series are on sale for PS5 as well, such as Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade ($30, $10 off), Final Fantasy VII Rebirth ($40, $30 off) and Final Fantasy XVI ($25, $15 off)\nBest Prime Day deals on PCs and PC components\nASUS ROG Strix G16 Gaming Laptop with RTX 4060 for $1,360 ($340 off)\nWhile an RTX 4060 isn't the most powerful GPU on the market, getting a whole new laptop with solid specs for just $1,360 isn't something you can just ignore, especially if you're on a budget. This ROG Strix G16 comes with 16GB of RAM and 1TB of storage. And while its Intel Core i9-14900HX CPU is one generation old, it's still plenty fast enough for gaming, video editing or pretty much anything else you need to do. I also appreciate small features like a MUX switch that lets the laptop connect directly to the GPU for increased performance, though if you want, you can also enable automatic switching for better battery life. And with a 16-inch 240Hz QHD display with 100% DCI-P3 coverage, everything on screen is sure to look great.\nAcer Nitro V gaming laptop with NVIDIA RTX 4060 GPU for $1,200 ($150 off, lowest ever price)\nAcer's Nitro gaming laptops are meant to be more affordable alternatives to its flagship Predator systems. But now thanks to Prime Day, this model just got even more budget-friendly while still offering decent specs. You get an Intel Core i9-13900H CPU with 32GB of RAM, 1TB of storage and an RTX 4060 GPU, the latter of which should pair nicely with its 15.6-inch full HD 144Hz display. I also appreciate that unlike some gaming laptops, the Nitro V is stylish without being in your face with too many RGB lights, which makes it feel like an even better deal at $1,200. That's the lowest price we've seen to date for this configuration.\nCorsair Vengeance RGB DDR5 RAM 32GB (2x16GB) RAM for $95 ($25 off)\nAdding some extra memory to your desktop can help unlock its full potential. So for Prime Day, Corsair is offering two 16GB sticks of its Vengeance DDR5 RAM for just $95. Not only do you get built-in RGB lighting, Corsair's onboard voltage regulation makes it simpler to overclock your system. And for those who don't want to mess around in BIOS settings, you can control almost everything from the easy-to-use free iCue app.\nThermaltake GF1 (2024) Fully Modular ATX 850W Power Supply for $80 ($30 off, lowest ever price)\nEven though power supplies aren't the most exciting component you can put in your desktop, the importance of a good one can't be understated. For just $80, which is the lowest price we've seen to date for this product, the Thermaltake GF1 is fully modular (which means you can add or remove power cables as you need them) and has an ample max power of 850 watts along with an 80 Plus Gold rating for efficiency. And thanks to its 140mm fan, it should be pretty quiet, so it won't cause a ruckus if you decide to play some games at night.\nSamsung 990 EVO Plus 2TB PCIe M.2 SSD for $114 ($63 off)\nIf you're like me and are constantly running out of storage, this deal for one of Samsung's 990 EVO Plus 2TB M.2 SSDs is a fantastic way to add extra room on the cheap. With a 36 percent discount for Prime Day — down to $114 — this is the lowest price we've ever seen. And it's not like you're cutting corners on speed either, as the SSD supports both PCIe 4.0 x4 and PCIe 5.0 x2 and read/write rates of up to 7,250/6,300MB/s.\nAMD Ryzen 5 9600X 6-Core, 12-Thread Unlocked Processor for $165 ($110 off)\nThe Ryzen 5 9600X isn't super flashy, but it's a really solid budget CPU. And now, it’s even more affordable during Prime Day where it's going for just $165, which is $110 off its normal retail price. It features six cores and 12 total threads with a max boost speed of 5.4GHz and support for DDR5 RAM and PCIe Gen 5. It's also unlocked, so you have the freedom to overlock if you want. That said, you will need to buy a CPU cooler separately, as one doesn't come in the box.\nAMD Ryzen 9 9950X 16-Core, 32-Thread Unlocked Desktop Processor for $434 ($215 off)\nThe biggest issue with the Ryzen 9 9950X CPU was that at launch, it was a bit overpriced. But during Prime Day, that problem is being addressed thanks to a $215 discount that brings its cost down to under $500. The CPU features 16 cores and 32 threads along with 80MB of cache and support for DDR5 RAM and PCIe Gen 5. However, like some of AMD's other processors on sale this week, you will need to get a CPU cooler separately.\nBest Prime Day deals on gaming peripherals\nRazer Enki Gaming Chair for $450 ($50 off)\nIf you're going to be spending all day in front of a screen gaming, you better make sure whatever you're sitting on is super comfy. And as I've been using the Razer Enki every day for the last four years, I can attest that this chair is worth the money. It has a ton of adjustability for things like the arm rests, seat height and more. For more flexible folks, it was even designed so people can sit cross-legged. I also appreciate that in homes where neon green might not fit your vibe, there's an all-black model (plus a pink one too, though that one is currently sold out).\nElgato Stream Deck MK.2 for $120 ($30 off, lowest ever)\nIf you've ever dreamed about becoming a gaming streamer or simply want some extra customizable controls for your PC, Elgato's Stream Deck MK.2 could make a great addition to your setup. It has 15 programmable macro keys with built-in LCD displays so you can make custom buttons for switching scenes, turning on lights and so much more. Elgato also has plugins for services like YouTube, Twitch, Discord, so it'll play nicely with all the major streaming platforms. In short, it's like a command center for all your content creation and livestreaming needs.\nLogitech G305 Lightspeed Wireless Gaming Mouse for $29 ($21 off)\nThe Logitech G305 Lightspeed gaming mouse is just a simple PC peripheral done well. And at just $29, it's super affordable during Prime Day too. It features six programmable buttons, compatibility with both PCs and Macs and a sensor with sensitivity of up to 12,000 DPI. Meanwhile, thanks to a battery that lasts up to 250 hours between charges, you can go weeks between needing to plug it in. And because it's wireless, there won't be any cords or cables to get in your way.\n8BitDo Ultimate 2C Wireless Controller for Windows PC and Android for $21 ($9 off)\nIf you just need an all-around solid gamepad for Windows or Android, it's hard to do better than 8BitDo's Ultimate 2C Wireless Controller — especially now that it's available for as little as $21 (depending on color) during Prime Day. Not only does it have precise Hall Effect joysticks, you also get a strong 2.4GHz wireless connection and BT support for added flexibility. The extra buttons for L4 and R4 are fully remappable and you can configure them without the need for additional software, which is a nice touch.\nAmazon Luna Controller and one month of Luna+ for $40 ($30 off)\nThe Luna Controller by itself is down to $40, which matches a record-low price. However, if you're a newcomer to Luna+, you may as well pick up this bundle (which is also matching a record low) for the same price, as it includes one month of access to the service for new subscribers. This gamepad is a solid option for those who want to check out Luna, Amazon's cloud gaming service. Prime subscribers get access to a dedicated channel with a rotating selection of games at no extra cost. This month, for instance, you can check out Death Stranding Director's Cut, Hollow Knight and EA Sports FC 25. \n8BitDo Retro Mechanical Keyboard for $80 ($20 off)\nWith its Retro Mechanical Keyboard, 8BitDo strikes a great balance between a nostalgic design and support for more modern features like wireless connectivity (both BT and 2.4GHz). There are several different versions to choose from, though the one inspired by the classic NES is the model I'd choose. The keyboard features an 87-key layout with PBT keycaps and Kailh Box switches, though because the PCB is hot swappable, you can always change them out for something else.\nSony Inzone H9 Wireless Gaming Headset for $198 ($102 off)\nFor anyone looking for a new pair of over-the-ear wireless gaming headphones to pair with a PS5, it's hard to do better than Sony's Inzone H9 headset. Not only does it have a similar design to the console, they are the only other headphones besides the official Pulse cans that support on-screen status notifications for volume, mic mute, game/chat balance and more. They also share a lot of the underlying tech used in Sony's iconic WH-1000XM line, so you'll get fantastic audio quality and active noise cancellation. But the best part is that at $198, you're looking at a serious discount of 34 percent, which is more than $100 off its regular retail price.\nSeagate Storage Expansion Card 2TB Solid State Drive for $209 ($21 off)\nGames are getting bigger every day, so if you need some extra storage for your Xbox Series S or X, you'd be silly not to pick up one of Seagate's 2TB Expansion Cards for just $209. That's enough room for a dozen or more digital titles (or like three versions of Call of Duty) and it's the biggest SSD storage module that slots into the back of the console without the need for a separate box.\nAmazon Basics UPS Battery Backup & Surge Protector 800VA/450W for $65 ($10 off)\nI'm not here to nag, but if you have a desktop PC, you really ought to consider adding a UPS (uninterruptible power supply) to your setup as they prevent power surges or momentary outages from knocking your system offline. Plus, this one has a beefy 450-watt battery backup and 12 outlets so you can connect all of your other PC gadgets to it. So if you're going to do the smart thing by adding some extra electrical protection to your home during Prime Day, you might as well save some money in the process.\nBest Prime Day deals on mobile gaming gear\nSamsung Galaxy S25 Ultra (512GB) for $1,070 ($350 off)\nWith Samsung's next Unpacked event expected to show off new foldables, it looks like some of the existing models are getting some serious discounts for Prime Day, including the Galaxy S25 Ultra. And at $1,070, this is the lowest price we've seen for Samsung's current flagship phone yet. For gamers, thanks to its Snapdragon 8 Elite chip, the S25 Ultra offers some of the best performance you can get in a phone right now, while its built-in vapor chamber should help prevent throttling. Its 6.9-inch AMOLED display is also one of the best mobile screens on the market today.\nGoogle Pixel Tablet for $249 ($150 off, lowest price ever)\nThe Pixel Tablet isn't meant to be a dedicated gaming device, but as something that can play casual titles (my current favorite is Sword of Convallaria) while also offering some nifty smart home features, this is a great shared device that can live on your coffee table. Plus, at just $249, this is the lowest price we've seen for the Pixel Tablet yet. And if you go for Google's optional speaker dock, you get a well-rounded device for playing music, browsing the web or watching shows that you can easily carry from room to room.\nRazer Kishi Ultra for $100 ($50 off)\nRazer doesn't normally run a ton of deals for Prime Day, but it seems this year the company is making an exception as there are discounts on everything from gamepads to headsets and more. That said, one of the standout deals is for the Kishi Ultra gaming controller. On top of just being a well-built gamepad add-on for phones and tablets, its larger dimension and USB-C port means it works with a huge range of devices — both Android and iOS. This even includes more niche devices like foldables like the Galaxy Z Fold series, which often don't fit inside other mobile gamepads due to their unique design.\nBest Prime Day deals on VR headsets\nMeta Quest 3S 128GB Bundle for $249 ($51 off)\nThe Quest 3S is one of our picks for best VR headsets for good reason. Meta cut just the right corners from the more full-featured Quest 3, enabling it to drop the list price down lower. It has the same Snapdragon chip and controlers, but cheaps out a bit on the lenses, slightly lowering the graphics fidelity in use. Just like the Quest 3, it works standalone for lighter games and streaming, or in concert with a gaming PC for full-fat AAA VR titles. It's well worth the $300 Meta usually asks for it, so at $249 with two games included (Cardboard Hero and the excellent social VR hit Gorilla Tag), it's a steal.\nBest Prime Day deals on gaming monitors and TVs\nSony 85-Inch Class 4K Ultra HD Bravia 3 LED TV for $1,098 ($500 off)\nThere's no better way to upgrade your living room gaming setup than with a brand-new, big-ass TV. Granted, the Bravia 3 is one of Sony's entry-level models (fancier sets get higher numbers), but with a discounted price of $1,098 for a massive 85-inch panel, this deal represents one of the biggest screens you can get for the money. It also has Google TV built in, so you'll get a very simple and straightforward way to stream your favorite shows and movies from services like Netflix, HBO and more. But perhaps most importantly is that for PS5 owners, the Bravia 3 supports exclusive features when connected to a PS5, such as Auto HDR Tone Mapping and Auto Genre Picture mode.\nAlienware AW2725DF 26.7-inch OLED gaming monitor for $600 ($300 off)\nFor anyone who has been waiting for prices of OLED gaming monitors to drop, this may be your chance to pounce on a great deal. That's because at $600, Alienware's 26.7-inch OLED display strikes a good balance between price and performance with a 360Hz refresh rate, 2560 x 1440 resolution and support for AMD FreeSync Premium Pro. And of course, you get those lovely pure blacks and vivid colors that OLED panels have become known for.\nSamsung Odyssey Neo G9 Series 57-inch 4K 240Hz 4K gaming monitor for $1,600 ($700 off)\nThis 57-inch monitor isn't for people with limited space. But if you've got the room, at $1,600, this is the lowest we've ever seen the Neo G9 as this deal represents a whopping $700 savings compared to its regular list price. This thing features a solid 240Hz refresh rate along with support for AMD FreeSync Premium Pro, a 1000R curve and Quantum mini LED tech with 2,392 local dimming zones. For people who love ultra-wide displays, this should be at the top of your upgrade list during Amazon Prime Day.\nAcer Nitro 27-inch WQHD IPS gaming monitor for $170 ($120 off)\nAnyone looking for a solid and affordable 1440p gaming monitor during Prime Day should really check out this 27-inch IPS display from Acer. For just $170 (matching a record-low price), it features a relatively speedy 180Hz refresh rate along with support for AMD FreeSync Premium and a good color range that covers 95 percent of DCI-P3. The height-adjustable stand can also swivel and pivot, while thin bezels on top and on the sides will make sure it won't look dated in a few years. So while this thing isn't super fancy, it's simple and competent in the best ways.\nBest Prime Day deals on batteries and power packs\nUGREEN Magnetic Power Bank 10,000mAh fast charging battery pack for $20 ($15 off)\nThe Switch 2 is a fantastic handheld, but its longevity could be better. So if you're planning to take it on a long trip, pick up UGREEN's 10,000mAH fast charging battery pack to help keep running when you're away from a plug. This power pack almost has enough juice to fully refill a Switch 2 twice, which can add between five and 12 hours of additional game time (depending on the title). It also has an output of 20 watts, which is as much as the Switch 2 can suck down at once, but it's still super pocketable measuring just four inches long and 0.7 inches thick. And if you need a convenient way to recharge your phone, the battery pack also comes with Qi wireless support.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-prime-day-gaming-deals-from-laptops-and-peripherals-to-the-latest-video-games-085719478.html?src=rss",
    "full_text": "It's the lowest price we've seen to date for this set, which comes with a nice little sticker sheet of character sprites. And while its Intel Core i9-14900HX CPU is one generation old, it's still plenty fast enough for gaming, video editing or pretty much anything else you need to do. I also appreciate that unlike some gaming laptops, the Nitro V is stylish without being in your face with too many RGB lights, which makes it feel like an even better deal at $1,200. And for those who don't want to mess around in BIOS settings, you can control almost everything from the easy-to-use free iCue app. Not only does it have precise Hall Effect joysticks, you also get a strong 2.4GHz wireless connection and BT support for added flexibility. They also share a lot of the underlying tech used in Sony's iconic WH-1000XM line, so you'll get fantastic audio quality and active noise cancellation. Plus, this one has a beefy 450-watt battery backup and 12 outlets so you can connect all of your other PC gadgets to it. Razer doesn't normally run a ton of deals for Prime Day, but it seems this year the company is making an exception as there are discounts on everything from gamepads to headsets and more. Anyone looking for a solid and affordable 1440p gaming monitor during Prime Day should really check out this 27-inch IPS display from Acer. This power pack almost has enough juice to fully refill a Switch 2 twice, which can add between five and 12 hours of additional game time (depending on the title)."

Well, for Amazon Prime Day, the company has managed to shave off another $24 -- the Method 360 ANC can be had for just $76 (white, black and red colors), which is an even better deal on a set of buds that was already a good deal at $100. I have a hands-on review of the Method 360 ANC you can read, but the quick take on them is that they're basically a budget version of Bose's $299 QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds. With \"Sound by Bose,\" not only do the Method 360 ANC buds sound better than most earbuds in this price class (they sound very similar to Bose's $170 QuietComfort Earbuds), but they also fit comfortably and securely thanks to Bose's Fit Kit system that features stability bands to lock the buds in your ears. Also, their noise-canceling isn't up to the QC Ultra's best-in-class ANC standard. It wasn't a deal-breaker for me, but most cases are about half the size. Also, I felt that their voice-calling performance could be a little better. But aside from those caveats, it's safe to say these buds are a very good value, especially at their new low price of $76.

    "summary": "Rivian has a new high-performance EV that you almost certainly don't need. On Tuesday, the automaker unveiled a quad-motor variant of the second-generation R1. The EV can do remarkable things, but it's positioned as more of an off-road brand magnet than a sensible purchase. The Gen 2 Quad R1T (truck) starts at $115,990, and its R1S (SUV) counterpart starts at $121,990.\nThe Gen 2 Quad lineup packs serious power. The four motors combine to give it 1,025 horsepower and 1,198 lb-ft of torque. It can go from 0 to 60mph in as little as 2.5 seconds. It can cover a quarter mile in 10.5 seconds.\nRivian\nThe new EVs are estimated to have a range of 374 miles. Rivian adds that it can increase to as high as 400 miles in Conserve mode. When it's time to charge, it has an NACS port as standard. That gives you access to most of Tesla's supercharger network. As a nice bonus, the R1 Quad series will include a CCS DC adapter, expanding your options.\nAnyone investing a fortune in one of these probably has some off-road uses in mind. To help with that, Rivian has a feature called Kick Turn. It allows you to make sharp turns or spins on dirt and gravel. It works by adjusting the power to let the R1 spin around its center without needing to move forward. Kick Turn will arrive via a software update in September.\nRAD Tuner is another new feature. It lets you customize your ride through sliders. It also has presets inspired by Rivian competition wins: Desert Rally mode (2023 Rebelle Rally) and Hill Climb mode (2024 Pikes Peak).\nRivian\nThe EV's interior matches its high-end positioning. You get premium quilted seats, extended stitching and a deep bronze finish on the dash, doors, and speaker grilles. (Fancy!)\nIf you're looking for something more practical from Rivian, you won't have to wait long. The R2 is expected in early 2026, starting at a more palatable $45,000.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/rivian-unveils-a-new-quad-motor-r1-variant-180333764.html?src=rss",

The speaker also has another interesting feature: Holding down the \"BassUp\" bass-boost button for 5 seconds sets off a 96-decibel emergency alarm -- Anker says it's clearly audible at up to 100 meters -- with flashing red LED lights.

While large platforms like Instagram and WhatsApp also have ecommerce features, Fudem believes brands still need direct, ownable relationships with their customers. OneText views itself as a competitor to the SMS marketing companies known for mass, impersonal messaging and spammy links. Instead, it uses a combination of tools — including AI-powered two-way conversations and humans in the loop — to improve conversions by 20–30%. Under the hood, OneText runs its own wallet which integrates with a brand’s existing processor to complete transactions. Over time, it plans to expand the network so shoppers can use their vaulted profiles across multiple brands, with pre-filled checkout data and smarter recommendations. In that sense, the company is building toward something much larger: a cross-brand, SMS-native payment network. OneText went through Y Combinator in 2023 and quietly built out its platform after Demo Day. Today, the platform has mid-sized e-commerce brands, doing $10M–$100M in annual revenue, as customers, Fudem says, though it also supports smaller startups and large enterprises."

A recent analysis by VegasInsider.com found that the Snack Wrap was by far the most searched for discontinued McDonald's menu item of 2025. McDonald's Snack Wraps first came out in 2006, and were meant to be a chicken item that would appeal to drive-thru customers. There are different versions, but the basic one includes white-meat chicken strips known as McCrispy Strips wrapped in a flour tortilla with cheese and lettuce with either ranch, honey mustard or salsa. Zach Ciampa, who regularly covers new food releases under the social-media handle Snach With Zach, said there's been an intense fanbase out there for the wraps. \"Regarding McDonald's Snack Wrap, it's by far the most requested item I've ever seen my audience ask or demand to come back,\" he told CNET. Read more: Review: McDonald's Minecraft Meals Feature The Hottest Nugget Sauce Ever Ciampa said the only similar fast-food items that come close to the same level of interest are Dairy Queen's S'mores Blizzard and Taco Bell's Caramel Apple Empanada, both of which have made recent returns.

    "full_text": "Waymo’s teen accounts will be similar to those offered by Uber, which also allows parents to make teen accounts in Phoenix and other cities across the country. The teens will then be able to order their own rides and share trip status with parents. Opening up autonomous vehicles to ferry kids could bring peace of mind to some parents who might otherwise balk at putting their child into a car alone with another adult, even though ride-hail companies like Uber say they pair teens with highly rated, safe drivers. And in states like California, where ride-hail drivers who transport kids are required to get fingerprinted, AVs could remove some of the red tape. That is, if parents trust the safety of an AI-driven car. Other safety concerns come to mind when imagining teenagers riding in cars alone. He did say that safety is Waymo’s top priority, as evidenced by the specially trained support agents available to assist kids during their rides 24/7, who might reach out to parents for additional support if needed. In a press release, Waymo emphasized that providing teens with a safer mode of transportation via robotaxis would help address the higher risk of traffic accidents that teenagers face. While Waymo is starting in Phoenix, the company said it would expand teen accounts into cities outside of California wherever the Waymo app is available. A spokesperson said Waymo may consider enabling access for teens through “network partners” like Uber in the future."

    "full_text": "I recently took an epic road trip through a land of giants, and there's only one compact projector I would take with me to complete my camping experience. Anker's Nebula Mars 3 Air made my nights at Kings Canyon National Park, home of the world's largest grove of sequoia trees, even more picturesque, without taking up too much space. In my lab, I measured a contrast ratio of 405:1, which isn't amazing, but it's better than most portable projectors. The side of my campervan makes for a decent impromptu projector screen. This can only be done via a mobile device connected with HDMI, and sometimes not even then, depending on your phone. Something else you'll want to keep in mind: This projector doesn't show full frame with a USB-to-HDMI. While you wouldn't want to backpack with it, the Mars 3 Air is compact and shorter than my Jetboil MiniMo camp stove. There are two other options I want to talk about that might be better in certain situations. It also has Google TV built in, is battery powered, can double as a Bluetooth speaker and (unlike the Mars 3 Air) it can charge via USB-C. That means you can have longer viewing sessions between charges as long as you have a battery bank. It also has extremely loud fans, and the streaming options are far more limited."

    "summary": "Somehow, Naughty Dog has found yet another way to get me to play The Last of Us Part II again. The developer just released a rather unexpected update to the remastered version of the game for PS5 and PC: you can now play the game in chronological order. Part II was infamous for the its big perspective shift from Ellie to Abby, but now players can go through their adventures side-by-side as they progress. \nNaturally, Naughty Dog notes that the non-linear structure is crucial to the way it envisioned the game's story and recommends anyone playing Part II for the first time do so in the original format. But there's a lot of potential for seeing how Ellie and Abby's experiences in Seattle in the main meat of the game impact each other, which should be fun to watch. I also like the idea of jumping back and forth more frequently through Ellie and Abby's different play styles. But this isn't the definitive way to play the game — when you load up a new Chronological play-through the first time, it notes that pacing may seem \"off\" and that tutorials for various actions may come after you've already had to use them.\nNaughty Dog didn't specifically say how quickly the game would intercut between Ellie and Abby's stories. But a quick video Naughty Dog posted suggests it'll be pretty frequent as their respective journeys through Seattle unfold. This also means you'll be starting the game with a bunch of flashbacks and cutscenes, which will be a big change. I'm trying to think what the earliest thing that happens in the game is that'll open this new experience — I think it'll start the same way as the original version of the game, but I also might be forgetting something here. \n\nThe timing of this update is also interesting, as it arrives a few months after season two of HBO's adaptation finished — and just a few days after Neil Druckmann announced he wouldn't be working on season three. Season two stuck close to the narrative structure of its source material but it didn't land nearly as well as season one, which could be why Druckmann is focusing on his main gig. \nNaturally, there are new trophies to be had for completing Chronological Mode, and you can unlock a few skins of Joel and Tommy dressed as brothers Nathan and Sam Drake from Uncharted 4: A Thief's End — a fun nod to Naughty Dog's other major franchise. This comes as the studio celebrates its 40th year, and just over five years after The Last of Us Part II was originally released for the PS4.\nNaughty Dog\nThe patch for The Last of Us Part II remastered on PS5 and PC is available now. Not surprisingly, Chronological Mode isn't available for the original PS4 version of the game — but if you own that, you can still upgrade to the remaster for a fairly reasonable $10. At least you don't have to pay for this latest update, right?This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/i-cant-believe-they-found-another-way-to-make-me-replay-the-last-of-us-part-ii-164513653.html?src=rss",

We are grateful that Samsung will address Epic's concerns.\" What it means for Fortnite fans and other Epic Games players In its suits against Apple, Google and Samsung, Epic Games has repeatedly claimed that restrictions from those companies have been anticompetitive because they have required the company to adhere to rules for the Apple App Store and Google Play storefronts. The company argues that consumers should be able to access games like Fortnite and Fall Guys without having to download them from the App Store or Google Play. In response, Epic Games made Fortnite unavailable to play on iOS devices, but has since relented. Those companies, meanwhile, argue that their app stores are more secure and protect consumers from security or privacy threats from third-party app ecosystems."

The most common scams have obvious red flags, like a drastic sense of urgency that you won (or owe) $1 million. Kitboga's bot helps him clone himself, releasing an army of scam-baiting soldiers at any given time, even when he's not actively working. Daisy could handle only one call at a time, but she communicated with nearly 1,000 scammers over the course of several months. But while each call wasted scammers' time, the company acknowledged it's not enough to reduce fraud and identity theft. We often hear of AI being used for sinister purposes, so it's nice to see bots playing a hero role against financial malfeasance. Their 2024 study proves how voice-assisted AI agents can autonomously carry out common scams, such as stealing a victim's bank credentials, logging into accounts and transferring money. \"Simply having these random chatbots wasting scammers' time — the scale of [scams] is just way too large for that to be effective."

    "summary": "There’s a lot to expect from this year's Prime Day, since it's been extended to run from July 8 to 11. One thing is for sure, though: you won't have to spend hundreds of dollars to get good tech this time around. Right now, you can grab a pair of Anker Soundcore Space A40 wireless earbuds for only $45, which is the best price we've seen. That's nearly half off their normal price, too.\nThe Anker Soundcore Space earbuds are currently our top pick for best budget wireless earbuds. While their performance doesn’t rival that of more premium products, we felt the Space A40’s feature set offered excellent value for such a budget-friendly set of earbuds. \n\n\nThese earbuds connect via Bluetooth, support connection to two devices at once, and come in a case that supports wireless charging. We were most impressed with the Space A40’s active noise cancellation (ANC), a feature rarely seen at this price point. While it’s not the most sophisticated ANC on the market, it does its job in blocking out the steady rumble of a train or jet engine. Battery life is solid for a budget pair of earbuds, reaching roughly eight to 10 hours depending on use, with another 40 hours or so supplied by the case.\nIn-ear fit is comfortable, as the round earpieces are pretty light and evenly balanced. The audio quality is impressive for its price point, offering a warm sound that can be fine-tuned with an EQ in the Soundcore app. A subpar built-in mic means the Space A40s don’t have the best transparency mode and aren’t the best for phone calls in noisy areas, but overall for $45 these are a great deal.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/our-favorite-budget-wireless-earbuds-are-almost-half-off-during-prime-day-145248313.html?src=rss",

It's also extremely quiet during use, so it can be operated at night without waking everyone up. \n\n\nIt runs for around 100 minutes per charge and it'll head to the outlet on its own for some juice.

It also ships with a remote control for those who want to ensure certain parts of the home get extra attention.\nThis is a budget robovac, so there are some tradeoffs. First of all, it doesn't connect to WiFi and there's no affiliated app. It doesn't really need it, as the obstacle avoidance tech gets the job done, but this does mean that owners can't set schedules or create maps with no-go zones.\nFinally, it's just a vacuum.

Keep in mind it's harder to meet fluid intake simply by eating food because of the volume requirements. There is a time and place for sports drinks, but this depends on the individual. \"Sports drinks can help very active people replenish the water, carbohydrates and electrolytes they lose during intense or prolonged physical activity,\" says Moore. Zeratsky adds, \"For moderate to intense activity, about an hour or greater, sports drinks can improve how a person feels and their performance.\" \"Fluid needs depend on your body size, health status, activity, climate (including altitude) and age,\" explains Zeratsky. Zeratsky explains that a good starting point is to aim for eight 8-ounce cups or 2 liters of water daily. Moore also suggests carrying a refillable water bottle with you to stay hydrated, going on to say, \"If plain water is not your favorite, consider adding flavor like fresh fruit, cucumber or a sprig of mint for flavor.\""

    "full_text": "The independent online bookseller Bookshop.org took a swipe at Amazon to celebrate the start of Prime Day, Amazon’s annual sale (which, despite its name, is actually four days this year). Like many other retailers, Bookshop.org holds a sale to coincide with Amazon’s big event — it’s a way to lure away consumers who may be tempted by Amazon’s deals but could be convinced to spend a few extra dollars to support an independent business. These anti-Prime sales probably don’t make a huge dent in Amazon’s bottom line (sigh), but Bookshop.org twisted the knife where it hurts: the graphic design of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos’ recent wedding invitations. Image Credits:Left: ABC News / Right: Bookshop.org Bezos’ three-day wedding to Lauren Sánchez is estimated to have cost around $50 million — not to mention, it took place in Venice, Italy, where overtourism is pushing out residents and impacts from climate change threaten flooding. Hundreds of people in Venice took part in protests against the wedding, which was attended by business moguls like Microsoft founder Bill Gates and OpenAI’s Sam Altman, as well as celebrities like the Kardashians. And yet, it seems that whoever designed a portion of the wedding invite, obtained by ABC News, could not even shell out for a Canva subscription. The image made the rounds across social media, with users speculating whether its lo-fi, childish design could have come from Microsoft Word clip art. And so, behold: Bookshop.org’s oddly specific dig at Amazon on the dawn of Prime Day. “Enjoy free shipping and the knowledge that your money will go toward supporting independent bookstores, not billionaires,” it reads."

When Vince Gilligan's hit drug drama came to an end in 2013, I was left wondering what series would capture the cultural zeitgeist next. He gets recruited by a mysterious Anonymous-like organization that wants to crash corporate America. Their relationship dynamic is reminiscent of the one between Brad Pitt's Tyler Durden and Edward Norton's Jack in David Fincher's 1999 cult classic, Fight Club. Emotionally resonant, intense, vulnerable -- his range runs the gamut -- and he's simply enthralling as Elliot. Mac Quayle's Emmy-winning, techno-laden score kept me nodding my head, even during the show's twistiest twists. Carly Chaikin, Portia Doubleday, Martin Wallström, BD Wong, Michael Cristofer and Joey Bada$$ deliver memorable performances that succeed in building out Esmail's sleek yet bleak world. He uses pop culture nostalgia and disruptive production techniques to keep us on our toes. One specific episode featured a reality-altering flashback, curious visuals and an iconic '80s sitcom alien that made me sit up and yell at the television like Leonardo DiCaprio in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. In fact, the overarching themes like political corruption, corporate greed and untreated mental health issues somehow make Mr."

    "full_text": "Higher prices for a lot of popular products seem inevitable on our current trajectory. However things shake out, numerous companies have already hiked prices or said that they'll increase in the near-future -- including, most recently, a popular and CNET-approved brand of smart lights. As other companies make such announcements, you can expect new names to be added here. Known for brands like Barbie and Hot Wheels, Mattel sounded the alarm over likely price increases during an early May earnings call. \"We will be carefully monitoring any tariff developments and may adjust pricing as necessary to reflect the evolving market conditions,\" a statement from Nikon explained. Parent company Signify announced that prices for its popular and highly regarded Philips Hue brand of smart lights will see price hikes effective July 1. The company also confirmed that this decision was made \"as a direct result of tariffs.\" Online retailers like Shein and Temu rely on direct shipments from markets like China in order to offer the rock-bottom prices that made them famous, so it's little surprise now that they've had to raise prices. Trump has notably disparaged companies that explicitly lay the blame for price hikes on his policies. In an earnings report published April 30, toolmaker Stanley Black & Decker addressed \"Price Actions in Response to US Tariffs,\" stating that it had \"implemented an initial price increase in April and notified our customers that further price action is required,\" and was also looking into ways to shift its supply lines to minimize the impact of tariffs."

    "full_text": "As Rivian starts accepting orders for its 2026 Quad Motor pickup truck and SUV, customers may initially be enticed by the power and tricks the four motors in these rebooted EVs can unleash. That control has allowed Rivian to introduce several new features, which will roll out via software updates in the quad-motor this September. Kick turn, which TechCrunch tested during a press drive in June, allows a vehicle traveling under 20 mph on dirt to kick out its back end and swing it to the right or left without moving the steering wheel. Rivian’s highly anticipated and cheaper R2 vehicles aren’t expected to go into production until the first half of 2026. What this means in practice is numerous sensors on the quad-motor R1S SUV and R1T truck provide information on yaw rate, steering angles, and other inputs, which are then fed into software models to control torque. It was here that early Rivian employee and R2 chief engineer Max Koff and R1 chief engineer Luke Lynch would configure the car as they wished — an exercise that often pushed the vehicles to new limits. Bensaid emphasized this is more than a simple change to the user interface that lets drivers tinker around with balance, stability, and ride height. “I think what’s really important is the technology behind it,” he said. The company is also rolling out a launch cam feature, which uses an exterior camera recording to automatically capture “Launch Mode,” which that can catapult the new R1T quad-motor from a standstill to 60 miles per hour in less than 2.5 heart-pumping seconds. Rivian is also supplying quad-motor customers with a complimentary CCS DC adapter, which was the long-standing EV charging standard until recently, allowing them to plug into other networks."

Among them is Alex Kendall, co-founder and CEO of Wayve. Kendall founded Wayve in 2017 with a bold vision: to unlock autonomous mobility, not through handcrafted rules but through embodied intelligence. His pioneering research at the University of Cambridge laid the foundation for a new generation of self-driving systems powered by deep learning and computer vision. Under his leadership, Wayve became the first to prove that a machine could learn to interpret its surroundings and make real-time driving decisions — without relying on traditional maps or manual coding. Today, Kendall is leading the charge toward AV2.0, an entirely new architecture for autonomous vehicles that is designed to scale globally. As CEO, he focuses on aligning strategy, research, partnerships, and commercialization to bring intelligent driving systems to the road. While full panel details are still under wraps, Kendall’s participation ensures that this session will offer more than just theoretical takes. Expect insights on how embodied intelligence can shift the trajectory of AI, the challenges of building systems that adapt to the real world, and what it takes to commercialize autonomy at scale. Catch Alex Kendall live on one of the two AI Stages at TechCrunch Disrupt 2025, happening October 27–29 at Moscone West in San Francisco."

    "full_text": "Most notably, the app is taking the first steps toward implementing a change that will bring it on par with other networks, but may also impact user behavior: It’s preparing to integrate Quote Posts, or what Twitter used to call Quote Tweets. On Twitter, now called X, the feature’s addition led to a culture of “dunking,” where users would deride another person by quoting a post and responding with snark or insulting humor. Some argued that while dunking made Twitter entertaining, it led to more negativity on the platform instead of encouraging conversations or healthy debates. Mastodon’s implementation of the Quote Post, however, aims to implement the feature in a way that will limit its ability to be used for hate and harassment. As the company explained earlier this year, it will accomplish this by letting users control whether their content can be quoted, and even let users withdraw their posts from the quoted context at any time. But Quote Posts aren’t being fully rolled out with Mastodon 4.4. Users won’t actually be able to quote posts until Mastodon version 4.5 releases later this year. The 4.4 version brings more changes designed to improve other areas, including profiles, navigation, lists, media controls, and admin features. For new users, onboarding has been shrunk to a two-step process from the previous four-step process, in the hopes of addressing concerns that it’s too complicated to get started on Mastodon. Server admins have access to new legal compliance features, like managing Terms of Service, offering translations of server rules in different languages, and an option to set a minimum age requirement for new"

    "full_text": "Users can generate clips up to five seconds long, which is in line with industry standards for publicly available video-generation models. The startup, co-founded by former DeepMind researchers who worked on Google’s own video-generation model, claims Marey is one of the few models trained entirely on openly licensed data. For independent filmmaker Ángel Manuel Soto, Marey’s biggest selling point is that it democratizes access to the top AI storytelling tools, especially for people who have long felt shut out of traditional filmmaking. Now, Soto says, Marey has helped him cut production costs by 20% to 40% and work more freely. Soto previously worked with Moonvalley’s studio, Asteria, on the HBO docuseries “Menudo: Forever Young.” Asteria, also known as XTR, was acquired this year by Moonvalley, according to Hemant Taneja, CEO of General Catalyst. (GC was a major shareholder in Asteria and invested more money into the combined entity.) Right now, that sort of understanding — which Marey shares with other models like Google’s Veo 3 and OpenAI’s still-private Sora — allows Marey to do things like mimic motion while still respecting the laws of physics. Or, Marey can superimpose a character that looks like George Washington onto an actor, translating everything from the actor’s facial movements to the muscles in his forearms as he gesticulates. Moonvalley’s plan over the next few months is to roll out new controls like lighting, deep object trajectories, and character libraries, said Talukdar. Marey’s public release puts it in direct rivalry with a growing field of AI video generators — models like Runway Gen-3, Luma Dream Machine, Pika, and Haiper."

In May, Marks & Spencer disclosed that hackers had stolen an unspecified amount of customer data, including names, dates of birth, home and email addresses, phone numbers, household information, and online order histories.

The company has reportedly sent out a Slack message to its corporate workers in New York City, asking for \"volunteers to help [it] out with Prime Day to deliver to customers on [its] biggest days yet.\" That message went out to everyone from engineers to marketers. Specifically, Amazon wants its officer workers to \"volunteer\" their time in two-hour shifts between 10AM and 6PM from Tuesday to Friday this week. \nThe volunteers are \"needed\" to pick items for grocery orders from Amazon's Fresh warehouse in Red Hook, Brooklyn. They're expected to pack the groceries in bags and boxes and then place them on receiving carts. Since the volunteers can't completely abandon their normal jobs, they will be able to take calls and meetings in a conference room. New York is one of Amazon's busiest locations, and the company most likely expects an increase in grocery orders this week, since it offers Fresh discounts for Prime Day. Couple that with a free trial for its delivery services, and people are bound to put in orders during the event. \nAmazon is known to hire thousands of extra workers to help fulfill the surge in orders for Prime Day, which takes place from July 8 to July 11 this year. So why did it have to ask corporate employees to volunteer? Well, the manager who sent out the call said it would help \"connect\" Amazon's warehouse and corporate teams. Griffin Buch, Amazon's spokesperson, said this wasn't the first time that Amazon's corporate employees have been \"invited to volunteer\" for warehouse fulfillment. \"This support is entirely optional, and it allows corporate employees to get closer to customers while enabling our store teams to focus on the work that’s most impactful,\" Buch explained.\nTo note, Amazon doesn't have a great track record when it comes to the working conditions in its warehouses. A previous report from the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) showed that Amazon warehouse workers suffer more injuries that their counterparts outside of Amazon. The company has also been accused of union-busting several times in the past. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/amazon-asked-corporate-employees-to-help-fulfill-grocery-deliveries-for-prime-day-131022042.html?src=rss",

Kennedy Jr spoke of his desire to have every American sporting a wearable within the next four years, a vision that led to raised eyebrows from critics. While Samsung may be sniffing an opportunity there, its acquisition of Xealth may have been in the works for some time. In any case, it's clear that Samsung is looking to diversify beyond its core businesses.\nWhat's more, Samsung announced the Xealth deal on the same day it projected a 56 percent drop in operating profit for the second quarter (compared with the same April-June period in 2024). This is, in large part, because of poor sales of its AI chips.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wearables/samsung-buys-xealth-to-integrate-its-wearables-into-the-healthcare-system-120502530.html?src=rss",

Samsung says the deal will help to advance its \"transformation into a connected care platform that bridges wellness and medical care bringing a seamless and holistic approach to preventative care to as many people as possible.\" That involves creating \"synergy\" between its wearable tech and Xealth's platform by bringing together health data measured on its devices and clinical records at hospitals.

    "summary": "Whether you’re working on an essay, doing research for a paper or just need some downtime streaming your favorite show — a good laptop is a sensible investment for every college student. The best laptop for college doesn’t have to push the envelope with the latest graphics card and processor, nor does it have to cost an arm and a leg. Sure, the best laptops come in all shapes and sizes and range in price, but college students don’t need a power-hungry machine to support their needs. The best laptop for college is ideally thin and lightweight, and provides enough battery to last all day without having to be tethered to the wall. No matter what you’re studying, we’ve researched and tested a range of laptops for you to consider as you decide which is the best laptop for college for you.\nWhat to consider in your next laptop for college\nIt’s important to consider your major and what you need your laptop to do before deciding on the best laptop for college. For example, if you’re a liberal arts major and will mostly be writing or making presentations, you don’t need an expensive system with a discrete graphics card. Alternatively, if you’re a film major who might need to render videos on a regular basis, having a beefy PC can significantly reduce the time it takes to finish a project. You’ll also want to take a look at any guidelines provided by your college or your specific program, as you may need required software or apps that only run on a specific OS. \nSome other things to consider are if you want a more portable 13 or 14-inch machine that’s easier to carry around, or if you prefer something with a larger screen. On top of that, if you are doing tasks like photo or video editing, you’ll probably want to go for a system with a high-resolution display (1440p or 4K), so it's easier to see details. As for other specs, ideally you’ll want 16GB of RAM (though you can go down to 8GB on a Chromebook) and at least 512GB or 1TB of storage. Most newer laptops now come with SSD storage, too, which means you can store and transfer data much faster.\nFinally, while your budget ultimately will determine how powerful of a laptop you can get, well-equipped ultraportables will generally cost between $1,000 and $1,400, with prices going up from there for systems with discrete GPUs. Budget Windows laptops and Chromebooks can be affordable alternatives though, with many going for just $500 to $700. But again, remember to check your school’s requirements because it’s not worth saving a few bucks only to find out that your notebook can’t run the app you need for all your homework.\nSee Also:\n\nBest Laptops for 2025\nBest Gaming Laptops\nBest 2-in-1 Laptops for 2025\nBest Chromebooks\nBest Cheap Windows Laptops for 2025\n\nThe best laptops for college students\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/best-laptops-for-students-130054631.html?src=rss",

Both MacBook Air models lasted for well over 18 hours in our tests, so they’ll likely last you two work days without needing to be juiced up. And while they’re far from gaming PCs, we were still impressed to see them run the graphically intensive game Lies of P at 60fps in 1080p.

This brings the price of many of the company's offerings down by up to 26 percent.\nPerhaps the best deal here is for the Beam Gen 2 soundbar, which has been discounted to $369. The regular price is $499. This particular device made our list of the best soundbars, and for very good reason. It's a great mid-range option with plenty of features. It supports Dolby Atmos and the relatively compact design ensures it'll likely fit wherever you place it. \n\n\nTo that end, it boasts particularly robust sound for its size. The only real downside is that it only has one HDMI port, which means you won't be able to directly connect a gaming console. It also means that older TVS with an optical jack will require an adapter.\nThe Sonos Ray soundbar is also on sale for $169, which is a discount of around $30. This one also made our list of the best soundbars and we particularly enjoyed the budget-friendly price and easy setup. We said it \"nailed the basics\" in our official review.\n\n\nNow onto more traditional speakers. The Sonos Era 100 smart speaker is on sale for $179, which is a discount of $20. This is a voice-activated speaker with stellar sound quality. The Roam 2 portable Bluetooth speaker is down to $143 from $179, which is a great deal.

But unlike some competitors, its hearty grip makes it feel like a full-fledged console controller. \n\n\nIt also has broad compatibility. It works with most Android phones, the iPhone 15 and 16 series and the two newest iPad mini models. You can plug into some foldables, including the Galaxy Z Fold 5.

(This is Razer, after all.) Its ABXY buttons and D-pad are mechanical. It has Hall effect triggers, programmable L4 / R4 bumpers and plenty of customization options via the Razer Nexus app.\nIf we have a gripe, it's that the thumbsticks aren't Hall effect.

    "summary": "Prime Day is basically Black Friday for Amazon’s own devices. For almost as long as the shopping event has taken place (it started in July 2015, if you forgot), it’s been one of the most reliable days of the year to snag Amazon gadgets like Kindles Echo speakers and Fire tablets at dirt-cheap prices. Amazon has regular sales all the time, but if you still shell out $139 annually for Prime, it’s in your best interest to wait until mid-July to grab gear that Amazon makes itself. That’s still accurate this year, too — for the most part.\nBut not for the Echo Dot. Yes, it’s on sale this year for $32. But that discounted price offends me personally — and it should offend you, too. The humble little orb of a smart speaker got the short end of the stick for Prime Day 2025. For reference, the latest edition of the Echo Dot was $23 last July Prime Day, and $23 again during the Black Friday period in 2024.\nWhile a $9 difference may not seem like much, it’s a slap in the face for Prime subscribers who have come to expect the exclusive deals available to them during this arbitrary shopping event to be just as much of a perk of their membership as access to Prime Video, free two-day delivery and the like. It’s worse that Amazon devices are the usual suspects when it comes to Hella Good Deals on Prime Day. If the Prime Day deal on the Echo Dot sucks, that means we can’t reliably expect any of Amazon’s devices to be down to record-low prices during this event.\nThis, of course, matters not one bit to Amazon. Why the company decided to punish would-be Echo Dot purchasers this time around and not Kindle or Fire TV buyers will likely remain a mystery to us. But considering the uncertainty surrounding tariffs in the US and the steady flow of rising prices on tech as a direct result of that, one theory I have is that Amazon is testing its customers.\nIf Engadget's historical Prime Day data is anything to go on, the Echo Dot is an extremely popular purchase — and Amazon likely knows that. If enough customers OK this objectively bad deal by purchasing the Echo Dot at $32 a pop, that signals to Amazon that it can continue to offer bad discounts on its devices without repercussions. I hesitate to say the days of a $23 Echo Dot are totally behind us, but they could be depending on how things go this summer.\nThat said, the best alternative to the Echo Dot this Prime Day is the Echo Spot for $45. Amazon revived that smart alarm clock last year and, while I don’t think it will boot the Echo Dot out of the speaker lineup any time soon, there’s an argument for such a replacement considering Amazon now also has the ultra-cheap Echo Pop. Regardless, if you were hoping to buy an Echo Dot on discount during Prime Day, I recommend skipping it and opting for the Spot or the Pop instead.\nIn addition, here are some Prime Day deals that are actually worth your time and money that all come in at $32 or less:\n\nThis $23 handheld fan that has already saved me from melting this year in the New York City summer heat.\nThe $18 Amazon Fire TV Stick HD that we recently named our favorite budget streaming device.\nA $16 Samsung Galaxy SmartTag 2, a favorite Bluetooth tracker of ours if you're a Samsung fan but also have a habit of losing things like your wallet or keys.\nA $20 AirTag, if you're also prone to losing things but identify as an iOS stan.\nThis $14 Anker wireless charging stand that's super basic, gets the job done and lets you power up your phone in either portrait or landscape mode.\nThis $19 Soundcore speaker that's a little larger than palm-sized and sounds pretty decent for its size.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/you-absolutely-should-not-buy-an-echo-dot-on-prime-day-113023843.html?src=rss",
