    "summary": "Welcome to Video Games Weekly on Engadget. Expect a new story every Monday or Tuesday, broken into two parts. The first is a space for short essays and ramblings about video game trends and related topics from me, Jess Conditt, a reporter who's covered the industry for more than 13 years. The second contains the video game stories from the past week that you need to know about, including some headlines from outside of Engadget.\nPlease enjoy — and I'll see you next week.\n\nLet’s all agree to stop talking about that awful conservative activist group out of Australia. You know the one — like a parasite, it attached itself to the censorship campaign that erased thousands of adult games from Steam and Itch.io, and successfully positioned itself at the center of the delisting narrative. However, logic and evidence suggests this group had very little to do with the mass removals.\nThis Australian anti-porn organization led a movement in April to remove the edgelord simulator No Mercy from Steam, and since everyone agreed that game sucked, the campaign worked and the title disappeared from the storefront. This is where I believe the organization’s involvement in the current drama ends.\nIt seems No Mercy spurred payment processors including Visa, Mastercard and PayPal to turn their attention to the PC gaming market (an irony that I would find funnier if it weren’t actively eroding an industry I love). These institutions took the opportunity to dictate the types of games they would support, and in response on July 16, Steam added a clause to its ruleset banning content that \"may violate the rules and standards set forth by Steam’s payment processors,\" including “certain kinds of adult only content.” Censorship on Steam is not new; Valve has for years had rules banning mislabeled adult content, hate speech, anything violating local laws and many other regulations. But outsourcing censorship to payment processors is new, and hundreds of games were removed from the platform following the rule change. On July 24, Itch.io rolled out its own changes and summarily de-indexed every adult and NSFW game it hosted, which amounted to roughly 20,000 titles being hidden from search and browse pages.\nThe conservative Australian group claimed responsibility for the Steam bans on July 19, three days after the platform’s rule change went live. The organization said the censorship was the direct result of two of its recent efforts: an email campaign that sent 1,067 messages to Visa, Mastercard, PayPal and others claiming Steam and Itch.io were hosting illegal sexual content, and an open letter addressed to the same financial institutions, signed by faith-based, anti-sex work and anti-queer activist groups.\nThere is no evidence that these campaigns were directly responsible for payment processors’ renewed enforcements. It’s actually ludicrous to suggest that roughly 1,000 emails or an open letter would even register at companies the size of Visa, Mastercard or PayPal. What’s more, after taking credit for the removal of hundreds of Steam games, the Australian group has attempted to distance itself from the whole shebang. Following intense scrutiny from players, industry watchdogs and media outlets, every group in this situation is trying to avoid accountability, in fact. Valve says Mastercard made this happen, while Mastercard says it’s just following the law, and PayPal says it’s simply doing what companies like Mastercard tell it to do. Meanwhile, the Australian group is trying to avoid blame for the sweeping Itch.io delistings while simultaneously attempting to exploit the Steam bans and gain momentum for its conservative bullshit.\nIn the most likely scenario, the Australian activist group saw these PC gaming audits coming and, in a strange act of stolen puritanical valor, took steps to center itself in the conversation. We can stop helping it do so. Forget its name and, as the IGDA suggests, direct your ire toward the organizations with power in this situation, namely Mastercard and Visa.\nStill. It’s notable that an organization backed by conservative Christian groups that loudly oppose sex work, queer rights and freedom of expression was able to so cleanly align itself with financial companies censoring content on Steam and Itch.io. This uncontested endorsement is especially worrisome in a political and social climate where women, the queer community, people of color and those who don’t conform to a traditional conservative lifestyle are under attack. At a time like this, subversive and raw art is more necessary than ever, but it’s also in its most vulnerable position. Choosing this moment to activate a censorship campaign is not only dangerous for our most vulnerable communities, it’s cowardly.\nThere’s been some additional misinformation wrapped up in this censorship mess, of course. Three games were incorrectly reported as delisted or removed from Itch.io or Steam as part of this situation: Mouthwashing, Trials of Innocence and Console Me. One game that was unjustly removed during the chaos was the psychological horror game VILE: Exhumed — read my interview with creator Cara Cadaver right here.\n\nThe news\nBioShock 4 enters a new circle of development hell\nIn most contexts, I’d be pretty stoked on the thought of a hell-based BioShock, but this is the worst possible iteration of that idea. According to Bloomberg, BioShock 4 failed a recent review with executives at its publisher, 2K Games, and it’s heading back to developers at Cloud Chamber for a narrative revamp. Plus, Cloud Chamber studio head Kelley Gilmore is gone and creative director Hogarth de la Plante was moved to a publishing role. Not much is known about the game that’s assumed to be BioShock 4, but it was revealed in 2019 alongside the formation of Cloud Chamber, so it’s already been in development for quite a while.\nIn related Rapture news, 2K’s remake of the original BioShock was canceled earlier this year, Bloomberg reports. Ken Levine, the creator of the BioShock series, is currently working on a familiar-looking FPS called Judas at his own studio, Ghost Story Games.\nGOG gave away millions of games to protest censorship\nGOG partnered with developers to release 13 games with adult themes for free from August 1 to 3, in protest of all the censorship going down on Steam and Itch.io. None of the free titles were specifically banned in the censorship campaign, but they featured sexual, queer or violent content that could easily be targeted by similar efforts. GOG handed out its free games to more than 1 million players.\nItch.io is reindexing free NSFW games\nAfter deindexing all of its adult games on July 24 — like, all of them — Itch.io on August 1 relisted all free games in this category. Itch.io is currently auditing thousands of adult and NSFW games that it swept up in the payment processor ban, and it’s unclear how the platform will support titles with these themes going forward. One of Itch.io’s longstanding partners, Stripe, said it will no longer facilitate transactions of titles \"designed for sexual gratification,\" but there’s apparently room for negotiation in the future.\nBattlefield 6 will land on October 10\nIn a shocking twist, EA also revealed that Battlefield 6 will have multiplayer content.\nAge verification is coming to an Xbox near you\nThe video game world is feeling the effects of the UK's Online Safety Act. Platforms including Discord and Xbox are implementing new age-verification methods to comply with the law in the UK, and Microsoft is planning to expand its program to other regions. It's in no rush, though, saying it'll use the UK as a guinea pig for these systems first, and then implement what it learns across the globe.\nSony is suing Tencent over its blatant Horizon clone\nAt its unveiling in 2024, viewers instantly called out Polaris Quest’s Light of Motiram for looking an awful lot like Guerrilla Games' Horizon series — our headline called it a \"pretty blatant Horizon ripoff,\" even. It took the better part of a year, but PlayStation's lawyers have finally kicked into gear. Sony is now suing Tencent, which owns Polaris Quest, over what it calls a \"slavish clone\" of its IP.\nRaven finally has a union contract with Microsoft\nRecent layoffs at Microsoft have only heightened the importance of proper labor organizing in video games, and one of the industry’s first unions is finally making things official. Three years after initiating the process, Call of Duty support studio Raven Software has ratified its union contract with Microsoft. Raven Software initially voted to organize under Activision Blizzard, but after Microsoft completed its acquisition of the studio in October 2023, it continued negotiations with the tech titan.\nPlay VILE: Exhumed, the game that Steam doesn't want you to see\nAfter VILE: Exhumed was removed and permanently banned from Steam for reasons that don't actually apply to the game, developer Cara Cadaver and publisher DreadXP have rolled out their own distribution model, and prices start at $0. You can download and play the game right now for free, and there's an option to throw some money Cara's way. A portion of the profits will benefit the Toronto-based charity Red Door Family Shelter.\n\nAdditional reading\n\nKris Holt’s indie game roundup\nSam Rutherford’s review of the Legion Go S powered by SteamOS\n\n\nHave a tip for Jessica? You can reach her by email, Bluesky or send a message to @jesscon.96 to chat confidentially on Signal.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/video-games-weekly-censorship-and-stolen-puritanical-valor-234220878.html?src=rss",

Another great feature at this price is carpet sensing — the S8 can raise its mops a few millimeters to avoid dampening your carpets. Most other budget mopping bots require you to remove the mop pads when vacuuming carpet or set keep-out zones around your rugs. The Eufy performed very well in my mopping tests, eradicating dried stains with its 2.2 pounds of downward pressure. It also has heated mop drying to help prevent the base from getting stinky — a first in this price range. If you have tile or scraped wood floors, a bot with oscillating mop pads will be better at getting into the crevices The S1 station’s debris filter got grungy fast and required manual cleaning, although this is fairly straightforward. The oscillating mop pads are slightly better than roller mops at getting into grout lines and other crevices found on natural surfaces. There is also no edge cleaning function, meaning it didn’t do a great job along baseboards and around furniture.

For reference, Earth generally takes approximately 86,400 seconds to make one full rotation. So, this won't be noticeable to humans and will not affect anything. There are numerous reasons why Earth could be spinning faster. This is expected to have a short-term impact on Earth's orbit. Scientists are puzzling over why Earth is speeding up at all. Approximately 245 million years ago, the dinosaurs roamed, and days were an hour and a half shorter than they are today. Science has measured Earth's rotation subtly slowing down since official records began in 1973. A research paper posted in Nature in 2023 suggests that Earth's core may have started slowing down as recently as 2010, which would explain Earth's faster rotation."

The financing follows a $1.25 billion Series B round from six months ago and a $1.5 billion Sequoia-led tender offer announced a couple of months ago, which allowed most employees to sell some of their shares. The latest deal brings Clay’s total funding to $204 million. Existing investors Meritech Capital, Sequoia Capital, First Round Capital, BoxGroup, and Boldstart also participated in the Series C, and a new backer, Sapphire Ventures, joined the round. The 8-year-old startup helps salespeople and marketers with AI-powered tools and claims customers like OpenAI, Anthropic, Canva, Intercom, and Rippling. Clay co-founder and CEO Kareem Amin told The New York Times that the company expects to end the year with $100 million in revenue, which would triple its revenue from last year."

Apple’s tablet lineup now includes six different iPads, which makes tracking deals across each configuration a full-time job. Below, you’ll find the best discounts on every current model. While the newest model isn’t drastically different from its 10th-gen predecessor, it does offer a few key differences. One notable change is the increase to 128GB of base storage, up from 64GB. Currently, the 11th-gen iPad starts at $349 with Wi-Fi and 128GB of storage. That said, there are great deals to be had throughout the year. Right now, for instance, the 11-inch Air with Wi-Fi and 128GB of storage is on sale at Amazon and Walmart starting at $547.27 (about $52 off). If you’re after the larger configuration, the 13-inch model with Wi-Fi and 128GB of storage is currently on sale at Amazon and Walmart for around $725 ($75 off). Stepping up to the 1TB model — which will provide you with even more room for apps, photos, and videos — will run you $1,459 ($140 off) at Amazon and Walmart."

Apple Cinemas has operated “outside a few suburbs and city outskirts in New England,” Apple says. However, Apple Cinemas recently opened a theater in the San Francisco Bay Area within 50 miles of Apple’s Cupertino headquarters and plans to open another soon. “Already, Defendants’ actions have confused customers and diluted Apple’s brand,” Apple says. The lawsuit includes screenshots of social media posts asking if Apple Cinemas is related to Apple. Apple also notes that “media coverage of the theater openings on both coasts found it necessary to explain that Apple Cinemas was not affiliated with Apple Inc.” and includes examples. Apple Cinemas is planning an “aggressive national expansion to 100 theaters,” according to the lawsuit."

Having all those devices pre-connected to a single travel router streamlines the process since you’re then only connecting one device to public Wi-Fi. You can use TP-Link’s mobile Tether app or the router’s web interface to navigate those annoying captive portals and login pages just once. Other reasons to use a travel router include an extra layer of privacy. The TL-WR3602BE includes support for the OpenVPN and WireGuard protocols, so you can connect to over 35 different VPN providers, including NordVPN and Surfshark, while using a public Wi-Fi network you don’t entirely trust. And while your smartphone can serve as a hotspot for a handful of devices, TP-Link’s new travel router can connect to up to 90 at once. It includes a pair of external antennas you can raise to extend its range, a USB-A 3.0 port for sharing files from connected drives, a 2.5 Gbps WAN and 1 Gbps LAN port, and a customizable button that can be configured to turn the VPN on and off, or quickly activate other functions."

It also grants access to the entire Paramount Plus catalog, including shows like Tales of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Yellowstone spinoff 1923, as well as films like Gladiator II and Top Gun: Maverick. Just bear in mind this plan offers fewer live sporting events than the Paramount Plus with Showtime package, and won’t let you download content for offline viewing."

App owner Meta did not immediately respond to a request for comment. WhatsApp's new \"guest chats\" feature doesn't come without risks, says Chuck Brooks, president of Brooks Consulting International and once called one of the \"5 Tech Voices You Should Be Following on LinkedIn.\" Brooks notes that the change offers the possibility that users with bad intentions will pose as trustworthy people, provide dangerous links, or attempt phishing schemes. \"Unknown contacts may forward and include links to phishing websites that aim to steal personal data or infect a user's device with malware,\" he said. \"It can also result in unwanted interaction, such as harassment or unwelcome group additions, when you receive messages from strangers.\" This forthcoming WhatsApp feature brings Meta in line with the European Union's 2020 Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act. One of the provisions of that legislation was allowing WhatsApp and Messenger users in Europe to communicate with people using other messaging services, or what Meta refers to as \"third-party chats.\""

In its announcement Monday, Spotify said it was introducing the price increase \"so that we can continue to innovate on our product offerings and features, and bring you the best experience.\" \"More money coming in means more being paid out, which is good for artists and songwriters — even with all the arguments still going on about how that money is shared out,\" Dredge said. \"Personally, £11.99 a month still feels like good value for the entire catalog of recorded music, especially when you compare it to the streaming video world.\" Spotify retains a comfortable market share lead among music streaming apps.

    "summary": "Intel is reportedly still struggling with a chipmaking process crucial to its future. Reuters reports that the company's 18A process is still producing low yields and high defect rates. Intel has invested billions of dollars in the manufacturing process, on which it's pinned its hopes of gaining ground on TSMC.\nThis isn't the first concerning news about 18A. Last year, a report stated that Broadcom was unhappy with the results of a test run for a potential order. However, Intel insisted at the time that 18A was on track to make its upcoming Panther Lake chips at volume later this year. \"Our performance and yield trajectory gives us confidence this will be a successful launch that further strengthens Intel's position in the notebook market,\" Intel said last month.\nIntel has typically aimed for a yield of at least 50 percent of usable chips before scaling up production. The company is said to make the bulk of its profit after reaching 70 to 80 percent. Last year, 18A's usable Panther Lake chips had reportedly only reached a five percent threshold. Intel had aimed for 10 percent by this summer. Tuesday's report doesn't state 18A's current yield, only describing it as a small percentage.\nIn a statement sent to Engadget, an Intel spokesperson said it is pleased with 18A's current state. \"We feel very good about our trajectory on Intel 18A, and it will be the foundation of multiple generations of client and server products in the coming years,\" the spokesperson wrote. \"Panther Lake is going to be a great product for Intel and our partners,\" the company continued, adding that its launch is still on track for later this year.\nIn a July interview with Reuters, Intel's Chief Financial Officer David Zinsner suggested that 18A's yields were better than reports claimed. He added that yields tend to \"start off low and improve over time.\"\nThe company's 18A process is a risky bet, combining manufacturing changes with a next-gen transistor design. Intel embraced the challenge with an aggressive timeline that one of Reuters' sources called a hail mary. 18A going well would also help attract business for its upcoming 14A process. Last month, Intel warned investors that it may have to leave chip manufacturing altogether if it doesn't land 14A contracts.\nThe company needs all the help it can get. It recently confirmed that it would cut around 20 percent of its workforce by the end of this year. That follows 20,000 job cuts from June 2024 to July 2025. Earlier this year, it took on a new CEO to try to right the ship.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/intels-next-gen-manufacturing-process-is-reportedly-still-struggling-184146350.html?src=rss",

Though Yaccarino does not have experience in health tech, eMed said in a press release that they sought her out for her “undeniable ability to negotiate new partnerships” — it certainly also helps that her tenure at X made her well-known in the tech world, drawing more eyes toward the startup. eMed previously produced a tech platform that was designed to be used with at-home COVID-19 rapid antigen tests, guiding users through the process of administering these tests properly. Now eMed is focused on GLP-1s, the class of drugs like Ozempic, which can be used for both weight management and treatment of type 2 diabetes. “To be a leader in today’s healthcare marketplace, companies need to have a fearless tenacity that allows them to not only grow, but to also be brave enough to step forward and redefine an entire industry,” Yaccarino said in a press release. “We are very well-positioned to be that tenacious leader, striving toward our ultimate goal of improving global healthcare outcomes through our groundbreaking services and platforms.”"

There's been some back-and-forth on whether the iPhone 17 will have a scratch-resistant, antireflective display. So there may not be major discrepancies between the iPhone 16 and 17 on that front. Megapixels aren't the only determining factor for good-quality photos but if it is an upgrade, that could make taking selfies or shooting videos for social media on the front-facing camera less of a compromise. One key element that could remain unchanged across both phones is the processor. In April, analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said the iPhone 17 Air and Pro models would sport 12GB of RAM but that Apple was still deciding whether to equip the baseline model with that higher amount too. In May, analyst Jeff Pu noted the baseline would remain at 8GB. That should help to stretch your battery life on either device. So any shiny new capabilities will likely land on its more premium phones first, such as the rumored antireflective display and redesigned cameras on the iPhone 17 Pro models."

    "full_text": "Previously, she was a writer and editor at MUO. Google rolled out a new tool within its Gemini AI chatbot that lets you create an illustrated story by simply describing it. Google also lets you upload photos and other images for Gemini to reference, like uploading a child’s drawing and asking Gemini to create a story about it. But other than that, everything seemed pretty standard for an AI-generated children’s story — that is, until I came across one illustration that put a human arm on one of the fish. 1 / 4 This fish just grew an arm. Another Gemini-generated story had a page involving spaghetti sauce that looked like a cartoon crime scene, while an AI image of a mother and son watching TV had the screen on the wrong side. My colleague Andrew Liszewski even spotted an AI-generated oddity in Google’s own video about the feature, which shows a woman building a spaceship and making “tap, tap, tap” noises while holding a wrench and some other tool I can’t make out. Besides coming across some inconsistencies in character designs, I didn’t spot any other blatant AI weirdness in some of the other stories that I had Gemini create. However, the chatbot didn’t seem to share my artistic vision when I uploaded an image of a cartoon cat that I drew. The Gemini Storybook feature is available globally on desktop and mobile, including in all the languages that Gemini currently supports."

Psychologists and consumer advocates have warned regulators that chatbots claiming to provide therapy may be harming the people who use them. J.B. Pritzker signed a law banning the use of AI in mental health care and therapy, with exceptions for things like administrative tasks. A spokesperson for Character.AI said users should understand that the company's characters aren't real people. Wright said she's heard of AI models providing license numbers (for other providers) and false claims about their training. The problem is that this can be expensive, and it's not always easy to find a provider when you need one. Jacobson's team at Dartmouth developed one called Therabot, which produced good results in a controlled study. Wright pointed to other tools created by subject matter experts, like Wysa and Woebot. Specially designed therapy tools are likely to have better results than bots built on general-purpose language models, she said."

    "summary": "Step aside, old boy. The ThinkPad X9-14 Aura Edition is making me forget all about the ThinkPad X1 Carbon, the most renowned business laptop for over a decade. Of course, Lenovo isn’t doing away with the X1 Carbon, but the X9 series certainly seems like the company’s experimental project for the same premium category. It’s not perfect, but I like where Lenovo is going with it.\nMuch love has been packed into the X9-14’s impressively ultraportable design, including a stunning 14-inch OLED screen, strong speakers, long battery life and solid performance for casual business users. The problem is that it costs a chunky $1,283 for low-end specs, it doesn’t come with a USB Type-A port and it’s failing the legacy of excellent ThinkPad keyboards. \nThat doesn’t stop the ThinkPad X9-14 Aura Edition from doing the best with what it’s got, and it’s got a lot.\n \nLookin’ sleek and ready for travel\nI’ve always been a fan of bold, colorful laptops, but I understand that in a business setting you’d want to blend in. The ThinkPad X9-14, however, manages to do so in style — it won’t draw your coworkers in from across the room, but you’ll hear a good ol’ “ooo” when they get a closer look. The dark gray aluminum frame looks like it was carved out of a space rock and then blasted with sand (or oxide, both give that sparkly grainy look). Of course, there’s the iconic ThinkPad logo in the top left corner of the lid with a red LED, but there’s also a X9-14 logo at the very top, which sits on an oblong island giving machine-look vibes.\nThe interior sports more of the same minimalist design, with my favorite visual aesthetic being the keys. It looks like someone carved away the bottom of each one to add a bit of flair, and I’m all about it. And if you’re not a fan of bezels, they take up very little room on the display. There’s a 4K webcam on the lip, which you can disable with the F9 button when you’re out of meetings. I’d do it in meetings too, because of its poor video quality — my features were fuzzy and my face was red.\nThe ThinkPad X9-14’s chassis maintains a remarkably thin 0.26-inch profile up until you get to the ports, where it expands to a neat 0.68-inch block that also holds the fans. There’s only four ports, but most of the essentials are covered, including two Thunderbolt 4 ports, an HDMI slot and a headphone jack. The critical miss is the lack of a USB Type-A port, which the 15-inch model supports.\nDespite that drawback, the X9-14’s thin frame combined with its 2.8-pound chassis make for an exceptionally ultraportable business laptop that won’t be a pain to pull out at a TSA checkpoint.\nPretty on the eyes, music to my ears\nNothing will make me gush more than a pretty OLED screen, and the ThinkPad X9-14 had me blushing like a pink Starburst. In my experience, OLED panels are less straining on the eyes (although this topic is somewhat of a debate), but I prefer them when I’m working all day. Even when you’re all done with your business, you won’t be able to pull away from this 14-inch screen with its 2,880 x 1,800 resolution. That’s sharp enough to capture each strand of hair on your favorite furry Disney sidekick. And whether you’re scrolling through endless rows of data on your spreadsheets or making your way through your indie-game library, the X9’s 120Hz refresh rate will enable smoother visuals than the average business laptop. The one thing I hate, though, is the rounded edges because it cuts off some of the visuals.\nI watched an episode of Steven Universe, which is iconic for its pastel color palette, and my eyes practically swam in the crystal blue ocean of Beach City. The dialogue sounded a bit quiet, but tinkering with the Dolby Atmos settings gave it the boost it needed.\nI couldn’t stop myself from jumping into a match of Marvel Rivals to keep my weekly challenge streak running, and the ThinkPad’s OLED allowed me to soak in all of the game’s vivid colors. I tried out Phoenix for the first time and blasted enemies with her cosmic flames, creating a visual spectacle of orange and yellow. The cacophony of explosions were distinct and well-balanced on the audio side as well, I could hear that jabroni (Star Lord) screaming “Legendary!” on my backline. The dual-speaker setup produced well-rounded audio for a business laptop. Tracks like “Golden” from KPop Demon Hunters (my new obsession) popped with crisp vocals and bassy synths, so feel free to take off your sweaty headphones and vibe at the end of the workday.\n\n\n\n\n\n   Rami Tabari for Engadget \n \n\nMushy click-clack and haptic feedback\nLike Rumi’s relationship with Jinu (I told you I’m obsessed), my relationship with this keyboard is complicated. I’m clicking away at this review, and the ThinkPad X9-14 is comfortable to type on, but it’s not as clicky as I want it to be. There’s some decent travel, but the keys are just… mushy. Sure, I can type on it all day as the buttons are very well-spaced, but they’re not satisfying to use. I imagine for most folks that might be fine, but after testing hundreds of laptops, I can say for certain there are better keyboards out there.\nOn the other hand, the touchpad was so smooth that my fingers slid across its glassy surface like a figure skater at the Olympics. Its haptic feedback offers enough response to mimic the real thing, and I’ve actually grown to like haptics more than real touchpads, which are terribly inconsistent.\nIn addition to the trackpad and keyboard, you can also use the ThinkPad X9's touchscreen to get work done. I experienced some resistance when rearranging some of my browser windows, so it’s not great if you’re just using your fingers. But I’m sure folks that need to sketch will appreciate it, especially since the OLED display will do justice to your art. (For some reason, Lenovo’s website doesn’t say that its pens are compatible with the ThinkPad X9-14, but a Lenovo representative confirmed they are, and the laptop itself also features the Lenovo Pen Settings app.)\nThe ThinkPad X9's performance: Business casual\nI’ve enjoyed my time with the ThinkPad X9-14 so far, and that’s with its bottom-of-the-barrel CPU, the Intel Core Ultra 5 226V, plus 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD. I expected some lackluster performance, maybe even a little slowdown, but it actually felt pretty smooth.\nI used the ThinkPad X9-14 to do a little work on the fantasy novella I’m writing, which, if you know anything about the genre, requires me to have an obscene number of tabs open. I split my screen in three, between Campfire, Google Docs and Legend Keeper, my unholy trinity of world building. The ThinkPad kept up with my shenanigans, so it’ll do well with most casual office workflows.\nIf you’re really crunching numbers, though, the Intel Core Ultra 5 226V is the lowest performing CPU you can get in the X9-14, which isn’t necessarily a bad thing, until you see the price (I’ll go into that below). Its benchmark scores aren’t far off from the Zenbook A14, but ASUS’ chosen Snapdragon X X1 CPU got marked for its slow performance. That’s likely because the Zenbook needs to emulate Windows apps due to its ARM architecture. While the Zenbook A14’s scores are a smidge better than the ThinkPad X9-14, at least with the latter you don’t have to worry about the latency of emulating apps or running into compatibility issues.\nSince the MacBook Air has been getting cheaper, I’d be remiss not to consider it as a competitor to the ThinkPad X9, either. If you’re shopping for any flavor of ThinkPad as a business laptop, you’re likely looking for security features, or remote management tools (if you’re in IT), and MacBooks offer both. The MacBook Air M4 13-inch is roughly 50 percent more powerful than the ThinkPad and the Zenbook. Again, the ThinkPad X9-14 still offers decent performance, just don’t expect to do anything taxing like video-editing.\nNow, if you’re thinking about cutting out some work and doing more play, the X9-14’s Intel Arc Graphics iGPU is surprisingly capable. You’re not going to be playing AAA games on max settings, but I hopped into a few matches of Marvel Rivals and managed a decent 40 to 55 frames per second. I maintained the native resolution but cranked everything down to Low with Ultra Performance and Frame Generation enabled.\nThe ThinkPad X9-14 crushed the Zenbook A14 in terms of graphics, and while the MacBook Air delivered stronger performance overall for video-editing and designing, it can’t compare to the gaming compatibility that the X9-14 offers.\nAnd like most modern laptops, the ThinkPad X9-14 has an NPU. If your job requires you to work with natively-run AI features, the ThinkPad X9-14 will aggregate those spreadsheets for you (and create cursed memes of, say, your boss’ face on a dog’s body).\n\n\n\n\n   Rami Tabari for Engadget \n \n\nA battery for business hours and beyond\nI spent quite a bit of time with the ThinkPad X9-14 before it eventually ran out of steam. It survived me working on this review, jumping to my book at the end of the day and a late night Discord chat with friends. On our video rundown battery test, it lasted 11 hours and 51 minutes. That’s more than enough to carry on your business and even add some overtime (or, you know, kick back and relax to some chill videos).\nThe competition is stiff, though. Last year’s ASUS Zenbook S14, which has an Intel chipset, clocked over 4 hours longer than the ThinkPad X9-14. Meanwhile, Snapdragon X laptops blow all those Intel machines out of the water, with systems like the ASUS Zenbook A14 coming in at 18:16. Still, while Lenovo's notebook might fall short of those impressive runtimes, at least it doesn't have the same app limitations that hold those devices back. It’ll get the job done, and that’s what matters.\nIs it worth the business tax?\nSo how much does this all cost? Well, the model I reviewed comes with an Intel Core Ultra 5 226V, 16GB of RAM (though only the 32GB configuration is currently available) and a 512GB SSD. That totals out to $1,283 on Lenovo's website (with 32GB of RAM). For context, I’ve seen more powerful gaming laptops that cost less. But you’re not buying a business laptop for its power, you (or your IT manager) are buying it for its features.\nWhile many non-business laptops are designed to be durable, you are still getting a military-grade chassis, which has been tested against drops, shocks and extreme temperatures. Then there’s Lenovo’s ThinkShield Security suite. That’s just a fancy term for saying the ThinkPad X9-14 includes a standard dTPM security chip, a fingerprint reader, a IR webcam for Windows Hello, an e-shutter for the webcam (F9) and Intel’s Threat Detection Technology (TDT) that uses AI to uncover cyberattacks. Intel TDT is included with Intel vPro, which can be used for remote management.\nNow, if you want that laundry list of business features and top-tier performance, it’s going to hurt. To upgrade to an Intel Core Ultra 7 268V with a 1TB SSD, it’ll cost $1,939. Yep, that’s quite the leap for specs we’ve seen in significantly cheaper laptops (like the Dell 16 and 14 Plus).\nIt’s important to note, however, that business laptops like the ThinkPad X9-14 aren’t really intended for individual consumers but rather businesses looking to buy in bulk. There are business laptops priced at a level that might appeal more to the average consumer, like the $1,399 ASUS ExpertBook P5 (P5405), but those are more rare than I’d like. For that price, the ExpertBook comes with a Core Ultra 7, 32GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD.\nWrap-up\nI thought I’d be more disappointed with the ThinkPad X9-14 considering its low-end CPU, but it’s perfectly suited for everyday tasks and made for a great writing companion. What really sold me was the OLED screen and audio, which are great not just for watching training videos or slideshows but also (and equally important) for after work when you get some play in, whether that’s literally playing games or binging your favorite new series.\nI also appreciate the battery life and portability, plus all of Lenovo’s security features packed into a military-grade chassis.\nHowever, I can’t justify the average consumer paying $1,283 for the ThinkPad X9-14 with specs you’d find in laptops that cost hundreds of dollars less (minus the RAM, of course). For small business owners, I recommend waiting for a sale or consider a business laptop marketed more toward you (again, the ASUS ExpertBook P5 (P5405) is a great choice). But if you’re the IT person at a company looking for a laptop to buy in bulk, then yes, the ThinkPad X9-14 is a worthy purchase.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/lenovo-thinkpad-x9-14-aura-edition-review-a-solid-business-laptop-with-some-quirks-171551190.html?src=rss",

The bigger version can run on a single Nvidia GPU and performs similarly to OpenAI’s existing o4-mini model, while the smaller version performs similarly to o3-mini and runs on just 16GB of memory. Until earlier this year, CEO Sam Altman cited safety concerns as the main reason for not releasing a follow-up. In January, after the rise of DeepSeek, Altman said that OpenAI had “been on the wrong side of history” by not releasing its own open models. “I think a lot of people are actually surprised to know that the vast majority of our customers are already using a lot of open models,” Chris Cook, an OpenAI researcher, said during a media briefing. On the safety front, OpenAI says that GPT-OSS is its most rigorously tested model to date, and that it was tested with external safety firms to ensure it doesn’t pose risks in areas like cybersecurity and biological weapons. “These are incredible models,” said OpenAI co-founder Greg Brockman. OpenAI isn’t committing to a release schedule for future versions of GPT-OSS, but it hopes that the model will be used by smaller developers and companies that want more control over how their data is used. “You let people hack, then they will do things that are incredibly surprising.”‬"

    "summary": "For the first time since GPT-2 in 2019, OpenAI is releasing new open-weight large language models. It's a major milestone for a company that has increasingly been accused of forgoing its original stated mission of \"ensuring artificial general intelligence benefits all of  humanity.\" Now, following multiple delays for additional safety testing and refinement, gpt-oss-120b and gpt-oss-20b are available to download from Hugging Face.\nBefore going any further, it's worth taking a moment to clarify what exactly OpenAI is doing here. The company is not releasing new open-source models that include the underlying code and data the company used to train them. Instead, it's sharing the weights — that is, the numerical values the models learned to assign to inputs during their training — that inform the new systems. According to Benjamin C. Lee, professor of engineering and computer science at the University of Pennsylvania, open-weight and open-source models serve two very different purposes.\n\"An open-weight model provides the values that were learned during the training of a large language model, and those essentially allow you to use the model and build on top of it. You could use the model out of the box, or you could redefine or fine-tune it for a particular application, adjusting the weights as you like,\" he said. If commercial models are an absolute black box and an open-source system allows for complete customization and modification, open-weight AIs are somewhere in the middle.\nOpenAI has not released open-source models, likely since a rival could use the training data and code to reverse engineer its tech. \"An open-source model is more than just the weights. It would also potentially include the code used to run the training process,\" Lee said. And practically speaking, the average person wouldn't get much use out of an open-source model unless they had a farm of high-end NVIDIA GPUs running up their electricity bill. (They would be useful for researchers looking to learn more about the data the company used to train its models though, and there are a handful of open-source models out there like Mistral NeMo and Mistral Small 3.)\nWith that out of the way, the primary difference between gpt-oss-120b and gpt-oss-20b is how many parameters each one offers. If you're not familiar with the term, parameters are the settings a large language model can tweak to provide you with an answer. The naming is slightly confusing here, but gpt-oss-120b is a 117 billion parameter model, while its smaller sibling is a 21-billion one.\nIn practice, that means gpt-oss-120b requires more powerful hardware to run, with OpenAI recommending a single 80GB GPU for efficient use. The good news is the company says any modern computer with 16GB of RAM can run gpt-oss-20b. As a result, you could use the smaller model to do something like vibe code on your own computer without a connection to the internet. What's more, OpenAI is making the models available through the Apache 2.0 license, giving people a great deal of flexibility to modify the systems to their needs.\nDespite this not being a new commercial release, OpenAI says the new models are in many ways comparable to its proprietary systems. The one limitation of the oss models is that they don't offer multi-modal input, meaning they can't process images, video and voice. For those capabilities, you'll still need to turn to the cloud and OpenAI's commercial models, something both new open-weight systems can be configured to do. Beyond that, however, they offer many of the same capabilities, including chain-of-thought reasoning and tool use. That means the models can tackle more complex problems by breaking them into smaller steps, and if they need additional assistance, they know how to use the web and coding languages like Python.\nAdditionally, OpenAI trained the models using techniques the company previously employed in the development of o3 and its other recent frontier systems. In competition-level coding gpt-oss-120b earned a score that is only a shade worse than o3, OpenAI's current state-of-the-art reasoning model, while gpt-oss-20b landed in between o3-mini and o4-mini. Of course, we'll have to wait for more real-world testing to see how the two new models compare to OpenAI's commercial offerings and those of its rivals.\nThe release of gpt-oss-120b and gpt-oss-20b and OpenAI's apparent willingness to double down on open-weight models comes after Mark Zuckerberg signaled Meta would release fewer such systems to the public. Open-sourcing was previously central to Zuckerberg's messaging about his company's AI efforts, with the CEO once remarking about closed-source systems \"fuck that.\" At least among the sect of tech enthusiasts willing to tinker with LLMs, the timing, accidental or not, is somewhat embarrassing for Meta.\n\"One could argue that open-weight models democratize access to the largest, most capable models to people who don't have these massive, hyperscale data centers with lots of GPUs,\" said Professor Lee. \"It allows people to use the outputs or products of a months-long training process on a massive data center without having to invest in that infrastructure on their own. From the perspective of someone who just wants a really capable model to begin with, and then wants to build for some application. I think open-weight models can be really useful.\"\nOpenAI is already working with a few different organizations to deploy their own versions of these models, including AI Sweden, the country's national center for applied AI. In a press briefing OpenAI held before today's announcement, the team that worked on gpt-oss-120b and gpt-oss-20b said they view the two models as an experiment; the more people use them, the more likely OpenAI is to release additional open-weight models in the future.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/openais-first-new-open-weight-llms-in-six-years-are-here-170019087.html?src=rss",

The company today faces growing pressure from Chinese AI labs — including DeepSeek, Alibaba’s Qwen, and Moonshot AI — which have developed several of the world’s most capable and popular open models. They’re here to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge. They’re here to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge. The company says each open model leverages mixture-of-experts (MoE) to tap fewer parameters for any given question, making it run more efficiently. OpenAI delayed the release of its open models several times in recent months, partially to address safety concerns. Beyond the company’s typical safety policies, OpenAI says in a white paper that it also investigated whether bad actors could fine-tune its gpt-oss models to be more helpful in cyberattacks or the creation of biological or chemical weapons. After testing from OpenAI and third-party evaluators, the company says gpt-oss may marginally increase biological capabilities."

And ChatGPT Agent is signing http requests using the newly proposed open standard Web Bot Auth.” But the report also found that malicious bots now make up 37% of all internet traffic."

But as we have seen with Google’s example, signing does not equal a full-on endorsement. In early July 2025, the European Union responded negatively to lobbying efforts calling for a pause, saying it would still stick to its timeline for implementing the EU AI Act."

Google says that NotebookLM enforces stricter content policies for users under 18 to prevent inappropriate responses, and user chats and uploads are not reviewed by humans or used for AI training.

For group chats, WhatsApp is launching a safety overview feature that will be displayed when someone who isn’t in your contact list adds you to a new group that you may not recognize. As for individual chats, WhatsApp notes that scammers might try to start conversations with you elsewhere on the internet before asking to message on private messaging services like WhatsApp. For example, it’s working to caution users when they start a chat with someone not in their contacts by showing them additional context about who they’re messaging. WhatsApp also shared information about how it worked alongside OpenAI to disrupt scam efforts that were traced back to a scam center in Cambodia. “These attempts ranged from offering payments for fake likes to enlisting others into a rent-a-scooter pyramid scheme, or luring people to invest in cryptocurrency,” WhatsApp explained in a blog post. “As OpenAI reported, the scammers used ChatGPT to generate the initial text message containing a link to a WhatsApp chat, and then quickly directed the target to Telegram, where they were assigned a task of liking videos on TikTok. The scammers attempted to build trust in their scheme by sharing how much the target has already ‘earned’ in theory, before asking them to deposit money into a crypto account as the next task.” WhatsApp says users can protect themselves from scams by taking time before responding to think about whether the message reads like a legitimate task. If they’re claiming to be a friend or family member, you should use another method of communication to verify their identity."

    "full_text": "The AI audio-generation unicorn ElevenLabs announced a new model on Tuesday that allows users to generate music, which it claims is cleared for commercial use. This move marks ElevenLabs’ expansion beyond its main focus thus far in its three years of existence, which has been building AI audio tools. ElevenLabs is a leader among companies making text-to-speech AI products, and it has expanded into conversational bots and tools that translate speech into other languages. Alongside the launch, Eleven Labs shared samples of its AI-generated music. One features a synthetic voice rapping about how it “came up through the cracks with ambition in my pocket” and left its hometown, traveling from “Compton to the Cosmos.” It’s unsettling to hear a computer reflect the influence and language of artists like Dr. Dre, N.W.A., and Kendrick Lamar, who actually lived the experiences that this technology is attempting to emulate. Given these concerns around what material AI music generation tools are trained on, it’s not so straightforward for startups to delve into music generation. These lawsuits allege that Suno and Udio trained their music-generation models on copyrighted material. The companies are now reportedly discussing licensing deals with major record labels. ElevenLabs also announced deals with Merlin Network and Kobalt Music Group, two digital publishing platforms for independent musicians, to use their materials for AI training. “Our clients benefit directly from this agreement in several key ways: it opens a new revenue stream in a growing market, includes revenue sharing so they participate in the upside, provides strong safeguards against infringement and misuse, and offers favorable terms comparable to other publishing and recording rightsholders,” the Kobalt representative told TechCrunch."

When the U.S. CHIPs and Science Act was signed in 2022 — providing $52 billion in subsidies to boost domestic chip manufacturing — the U.S. produced only about 10% of global chips. Despite this small manufacturing footprint, more than half of global semiconductor companies are headquartered in the U.S. Both Intel and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) have received funding from the CHIPs Act. Those rules had established a country-specific, multi-tier approach to restricting chip exports based on national security concerns.

Cisco said it discovered the breach on July 24, blaming the incident on a voice phishing or “vishing” call. The hackers accessed and exported “a subset of basic profile information” from the database of a third party cloud-based customer relationship management (CRM) system, according to the company’s disclosure. Cisco said that the stolen data included the customer’s “name, organization name, address, Cisco assigned user ID, email address, phone number, and account-related metadata,” such as the account creation date. The networking tech giant did not specify how many Cisco.com users were affected by the breach. When reached by email, Cisco spokesperson Carro Halpin would not say. As Bleeping Computer noted, this breach could be another one in a string of attacks that targeted companies’ Salesforce data, including U.S. insurance giant Allianz Life, luxury retailer Tiffany and Co., Australian airline Qantas, and others. Cisco is a known customer of Salesforce, according to the cloud giant. This story was updated to include a response from Cisco."

The service costs $2.99 per month and features a library of nearly 10,000 hours of content from its partners, including Lionsgate, Warner Bros. The company says subscribers will be able to watch titles like “Mad Max: Fury Road,” “The Blind Side,” “Weeds,” and “Kids in the Hall,” as well as rom-coms, medical dramas, ’90s comedies, and the like. “Howdy is ad-free and designed to complement, not compete with, premium services,” said Roku founder and CEO Anthony Wood in a press release. The move comes two months after Roku paid $185 million to acquire Frndly TV, a streaming service that offers live TV, on-demand video, and cloud-based DVR. Howdy joins the company’s Roku Channel, its free, ad-supported (FAST) streaming service. A recent report found that The Roku Channel is the most popular FAST service, ahead of competitors Tubi and Pluto TV. More than 125 million people use the platform every day, Roku says. A key growth driver for Howdy will be Roku’s organic reach — the company said earlier this year that it had surpassed 90 million streaming households. Roku last week reported its second-quarter financials, turning in better-than-expected revenue growth of 15%, as streaming hours on the platform came in at 35.4 billion, up 5.2 billion hours from a year earlier."

Howdy is a natural step for us at Roku, extending our mission to make better TV for everyone, by making it affordable, accessible, and built for how people watch today.\" You can sign up or cancel Howdy whenever you want, but the platform is accessible only in the US on Roku devices, the Roku app and via its website. The addition of Howdy is one of Roku's latest moves to expand its foothold in streaming TV. In May, the company announced its acquisition of Frndly TV, a live TV streaming service with plans ranging from $8 to $12 a month."

With a simple text prompt, Genie 3 can generate multiple minutes of interactive 3D environments at 720p resolution at 24 frames per second — a significant jump from the 10 to 20 seconds Genie 2 could produce. Perhaps most importantly, Genie 3’s simulations stay physically consistent over time because the model can remember what it previously generated — a capability that DeepMind says its researchers didn’t explicitly program into the model.

And it’s still difficult to accurately model complex interactions between multiple independent agents in a shared environment. Genie 3 can also only support a few minutes of continuous interaction, when hours would be necessary for proper training. “We haven’t really had a Move 37 moment for embodied agents yet, where they can actually take novel actions in the real world,” Parker-Holder said, referring to the legendary moment in the 2016 game of Go between DeepMind’s AI agent AlphaGo and world champion Lee Sedol, in which Alpha Go played an unconventional and brilliant move that became symbolic of AI’s ability to discover new strategies beyond human understanding."

    "summary": "At start of December, Google DeepMind released Genie 2. The Genie family of AI systems are what are known as world models. They're capable of generating images as the user — either a human or, more likely, an automated AI agent — moves through the world the software is simulating. The resulting video of the model in action may look like a video game, but DeepMind has always positioned Genie 2 as a way to train other AI systems to be better at what they're designed to accomplish. With its new Genie 3 model, which the lab announced on Tuesday, DeepMind believes it has made an even better system for training AI agents.   \nAt first glance, the jump between Genie 2 and 3 isn't as dramatic as the one the model made last year. With Genie 2, DeepMind's system became capable of generating 3D worlds, and could accurately reconstruct part of the environment even after the user or an AI agent left it to explore other parts of the generated scene. Environmental consistency was often a weakness of prior world models. For instance, Decart's Oasis system had trouble remembering the layout of the Minecraft levels it would generate. \nBy comparison, the enhancements offered by Genie 3 seem more modest, but in a press briefing Google held ahead of today's official announcement, Shlomi Fruchter, research director at DeepMind, and Jack Parker-Holder, research scientist at DeepMind, argued they represent important stepping stones in the road toward artificial general intelligence.\nSo what exactly does Genie 3 do better? To start, it outputs footage at 720p, instead of 360p like its predecessor. It's also capable of sustaining a \"consistent\" simulation for longer. Genie 2 had a theoretical limit of up to 60 seconds, but in practice the model would often start to hallucinate much earlier. By contrast, DeepMind says Genie 3 is capable of running for several minutes before it starts producing artifacts.\n\nAlso new to the model is a capability DeepMind calls \"promptable world events.\" Genie 2 was interactive insofar as the user or an AI agent was able to input movement commands and the model would respond after it had a few moments to generate the next frame. Genie 3 does this work in real-time. Moreover, it’s possible to tweak the simulation with text prompts that instruct Genie to alter the state of the world it’s generating. In a demo DeepMind showed, the model was told to insert a herd of deer into a scene of a person skiing down a mountain. The deer didn't move in the most realistic manner, but this is the killer feature of Genie 3, says DeepMind.\nAs mentioned before, the lab primarily envisions the model as a tool for training and evaluating AI agents. DeepMind says Genie 3 could be used to teach AI systems to tackle \"what if\" scenarios that aren't covered by their pre-training. \"There are a lot of things that have to happen before a model can be deployed in the real world, but we do see it as a way to more efficiently train models and increase their reliability,\" said Fruchter, pointing to, for example, a scenario where Genie 3 could be used to teach a self-driving car how to safely avoid a pedestrian that walks in front of it.\nGoogle DeepMind\nDespite the improvements DeepMind has made to Genie, the lab acknowledges there's much work to be done. For instance, the model can't generate real-world locations with perfect accuracy, and it struggles with text rendering. Moreover, for Genie to be truly useful, DeepMind believes the model needs to be able to sustain a simulated world for hours, not minutes. Still, the lab feels Genie is ready to make a real-world impact.\n\"We already at the point where you wouldn't use [Genie] as your sole training environment, but you can certainly finds things you wouldn't want agents to do because if they act unsafe in some settings, even if those settings aren't perfect, it's still good to know,\" said Parker-Holder. \"You can already see where this is going. It will get increasingly useful as the models get better.\"\nFor the time being, Genie 3 isn't available to the general public. However, DeepMind says it's working to make the model available to additional testers.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/google-deepminds-genie-3-can-dynamically-alter-the-state-of-its-simulated-worlds-140052124.html?src=rss",

    "full_text": "Though Spotify launched its audiobooks service in the U.S. back in 2022, household members on Duo and Family plans have long been left out. Through Spotify Premium, subscribers already have access to 15 hours of audiobook listening per month and can buy additional hours to top off that, as needed. This is made possible through the add-on called “Audiobooks+ for Plan Members.” Spotify CEO Daniel Ek pointed to a weaker ads business as the cause. (Spotify’s ads chief had just left for DoorDash, media outlets reported ahead of earnings.) In December, publisher HarperCollins teased a solution for the problem with household members’ inability to access audiobooks. HarperCollins CEO Brian Murray said at the time that Spotify was working to adjust a “technical problem” with family plans that limited audiobook streaming only to the family plan’s credit card holder. Last month, Spotify made good on that promise when it expanded audiobook access to plan members for the first time with the launch of Audiobooks+ in several non-U.S. markets. Notably, that’s before these add-on plans became available. Spotify says it will experiment with other options for book fans in the future, including direct sales."

The company said it is “actively investigating these incidents to determine whether they are connected to a previously disclosed vulnerability or if a new vulnerability may be responsible.” The company’s alert comes as security researchers say they have identified hackers targeting SonicWall devices to gain initial access to a victim’s network. Hackers are increasingly targeting enterprise products, like firewalls and VPNs, which work as digital gatekeepers, allowing legitimate employees access to the company’s network. But security flaws in these products can allow malicious hackers in, enabling attackers to launch data-stealing or destructive attacks. Security firm Arctic Wolf said it has seen intrusions targeting SonicWall customers as far back as mid-July. Huntress Labs, another cybersecurity firm, said it is “likely” that a zero-day bug in SonicWall firewalls is to blame for the attacks, and warned that the hackers exploiting the bug have been seen gaining access to a company’s domain controllers, which manages the devices and users on that network. In its blog, Huntress said it believes the Akira ransomware gang is behind some of the attacks targeting SonicWall customers. Akira has been known to target enterprise products, like Fortinet firewalls, to break into large networks."

Amazon has a sale on the latest M4 MacBook Air that knocks up to 20 percent off many configurations.\nThe base model is where you'll get the biggest discount. The 16GB RAM/256GB SSD laptop is down to $799 from $999, which is the lowest price we've seen. You can upgrade to 512GB SSD for $999, down from $1,199, another all-time low price, or 24GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD for $1,199, down from $1,399. \n \nThen there's the 15-inch MacBook Air M4, whose cheapest model is on sale for $999, dropping from $1,199. The 17 percent discount is the best deal we've seen since the pair debuted in March. As with the 13-inch model, the 16GB and 512GB SSD option is also a record-low price, dropping to $1,199 from $1,399. Then there's the 24GB upgrade, which is $1,399, down from $1,599.\nWe're big fans of the MacBook Air M4, giving it a 92 in our review. Part of that comes from an already lower starting price for the MacBooks than their predecessors. The 2025 models also get a speed boost thanks to the M4 chip and are very thin with a 0.44-inch thickness.

The screen is obviously bigger, as is its trackpad. Other than that, it offers better speakers than its 13-inch sibling. \n \nCheck out our coverage of the best Apple deals for more discounts, and follow @EngadgetDeals on X for the latest tech deals and buying advice.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/pick-up-apples-macbook-air-m4-while-its-on-sale-for-an-all-time-low-price-123031128.html?src=rss",
    "full_text": "Whether you need a new MacBook for the upcoming semester or you've just been itching to upgrade from an older machine, now's a good time to buy. Amazon has a sale on the latest M4 MacBook Air that knocks up to 20 percent off many configurations. The 16GB RAM/256GB SSD laptop is down to $799 from $999, which is the lowest price we've seen. Then there's the 15-inch MacBook Air M4, whose cheapest model is on sale for $999, dropping from $1,199. As with the 13-inch model, the 16GB and 512GB SSD option is also a record-low price, dropping to $1,199 from $1,399. We're big fans of the MacBook Air M4, giving it a 92 in our review. Part of that comes from an already lower starting price for the MacBooks than their predecessors. The 2025 models also get a speed boost thanks to the M4 chip and are very thin with a 0.44-inch thickness. Neither the 13- or 15-inch will drag you down, weighing 2.7 pounds and 3.2 pounds, respectively.

    "summary": "It’s impressive what tablets and ultraportable laptops can do. But to get the most functionality out of them, you may want a few more ports at your disposal, which is where a USB-C hub comes into play. By connecting to just one port, these handy devices give you extra USB connections, HDMI slots, SD card readers and Ethernet jacks. Plus most offer pass-through charging so you can keep your tablet powered while you work with all your peripherals hooked up. We tested more than a dozen models to come up with a few great picks for different situations and users. Here are the best USB-C hubs based on our testing.\nTable of contents\n\nBest USB-C hubs for 2025\nWhat to look for in a USB-C hub\nHow we test USB-C hubs\nOther hubs we tested \nRecent updates\n\nBest USB-C hubs for 2025\n \n \n \n \nWhat to look for in a USB-C hub\nHub vs docking station\nThe first thing to decide is whether you need a USB-C hub or a USB-C docking station. There’s no set standard for what differentiates the two, but docking stations tend to have more ports, offer a separate DC power adapter and cost more, with some reaching upwards of $400. We have a separate guide to the best docking stations to check out if you’re looking for something bigger than what we’re discussing here. USB-C hubs, in contrast, have between four and 10 ports, can support pass-through charging and typically cost between $30 and $150. \nHubs, sometimes also called dongles or even multiport adapters, make more sense for smaller setups with just a few peripherals, such as a monitor, a wired keyboard and mouse, and the occasional external drive. They’re also more portable, since they’re small and require no dedicated power. That could be useful if you change work locations but want to bring your accessories with you, or if you want to replace your laptop with a more powerful tablet. A docking station or Thunderbolt dock makes more sense for someone who needs a robust setup for their laptop, including multiple external monitors, webcams, stream decks, microphones and so on.\nBoth docks and hubs make it easy to grab your laptop off your desk for a meeting or other brief relocation and when you get back, you only need to plug in one cable to get all your accessories reconnected. Of course, if you just need to plug in one peripheral, you may not need a hub or a dock, a simple USB-C adapter, like HDMI to USB-C or USB-A to USB-C, may do the trick.\nPorts\nFor a USB-C hub to work, it needs to connect to a port on your laptop or tablet that supports video, data and power — all of which is covered by anything listed as USB 3.0 or better, including USB4 and Thunderbolt 3 and Thunderbolt 4. The port, of course, needs to be Type-C as well. The sea of laptops out there is vast, so it’s hard to make generalizations, but modern laptops, including Windows and Apple models, should have at least one USB-C port that will suffice, and indeed, every one of our top picks for the best laptops do — including our top pick, the M4 MacBook Air.\nNext, it’s a matter of finding a good USB-C hub that has the right connections for your needs. Most hubs offer some combo of HDMI, USB, SD card reader, Ethernet and 3.5 mm ports. If you have a 4K monitor and would like at least a 60Hz refresh rate, you’ll need a hub with an HDMI 2.0 port — HDMI 1.4 only goes up to 30Hz. HDMI 2.1 will handle 4K at up to 120Hz, but hubs that have adopted that standard aren’t as common just yet. Keep in mind that a low refresh rate can cause your screen to feel laggy, making your mouse appear glitchy and your webcam movements to look delayed.\nAdditional USB ports on these accessories are usually USB Type-A or USB Type-C. They can support data with different transfer rates, typically 5Gbps or 10Gbps. Some ports only handle passthrough power and no data, and some can do data, power and video, so it’s best to check the spec list to make sure you’re getting the support you need. Keep in mind that a hub may bill itself as a 7-in-1, but one of those ports may not be usable for anything other than charging.\nStandard SD and microSD cards are useful for transferring data from cameras and the like or for offloading files from your hard drive, and many hubs have those slots. Ethernet ports may deliver faster internet speeds than your Wi-Fi and a hub with a 3.5mm jack can bring back the wired headphone connection that some laptops have ditched.\n\n\n\n\nPower delivery\nNearly all of the USB-C hubs I tested support passthrough charging. That means if your laptop or tablet only charges via USB, you don’t have to take up another port on your laptop to keep everything topped up. Unlike a docking station, powering a hub is optional. The one exception is if you want to close the lid on your laptop while you work on an external monitor. Most computers will go into sleep mode if the lid is closed without power, so either the laptop or the hub will need to be plugged into the wall to prevent that from happening.\nMany of the newer hubs include a 100W USB-C power delivery (PD) port, with a healthy 80 to 85 watts going to your Mac, PC, iPad or Android tablet (the hubs take a little of the juice for themselves, hence the 15-watt or so difference). In my tests, a powered USB hub ran hotter than when it wasn't passing the charge through, so I prefer to power the computer directly using its own charger. But for tablets or other devices with no extra ports, that PD option is important.\nSome PD ports are also data ports — which is both good and bad. On one hand, it feels wasteful to use a perfectly good data port just for boring old electricity. But on the other hand, USB-C connections that only carry a charge are less versatile, and it makes it seem like it has more accessory hookups than it actually does.\nDesign\nThere’s surprisingly little design variation among hubs. Most look like a flat slab, a little smaller than a smartphone, and have an attached Type-C host cable. The hues range from a silvery black to a silvery gray. Some are thinner than others, some have all ports on one edge and some have ports on both sides. All of this is just to say that aesthetics probably won’t make or break your buying decision.\nOne variation that could tip the scales is the length of the cable. A longer one will give you more freedom as you arrange the hub on your desk, potentially even letting you hide it behind your laptop. Or you may prefer a shorter one to keep the hub neatly set beside your laptop.\nHow we test USB-C hubs\nBefore we test anything, we take a look at what’s available and how they’ve been received by shoppers, forum-goers and other publications. I became familiar with a few reputable brands when I was testing docking stations, so I looked into hubs from those companies as well. I focused on items that would help with an average day of productivity — not high-end setups or demanding gaming situations. Once I settled on a dozen or so that would make good candidates, I had them shipped to my humble office in the desert and started testing them out over the course of a few weeks.\nI used an M1 MacBook Pro running MacOS Sonoma as the host computer and plugged in accessories that include a 4K Dell monitor, a ZSA USB-C ergo keyboard, a Logitech USB-A gaming mouse, an Elgato USB-C 4K webcam, a Logitech streaming light, a USB-A 3.0 Sandisk thumb drive, a USB-C Samsung T7 Shield external drive and a pair of wired headphones I got for free on an airplane (I should probably invest in some wired headphones, but the cord dangling on my chest drives me nutty so all my earbuds are wireless). I used high-end HDMI and USB-C cables to ensure that any data or connectivity issues weren’t related to my equipment.\nThen I put each USB-C hub through a gamut of basic tests. I looked at what could be plugged in at once, the resolution on the monitor, data transfer speeds, the overall build quality of the hub and general usability factors, like the placement of the ports and the length of the cords. And, finally, the price-to-value ratio helped determine the best ones for a few different use cases.\nOther hubs we tested\nHyperDrive Next 10 Port USB-C Hub\nThere’s a lot to like about HyperDrive’s Next 10 Port USB-C Hub. The tethered cable is a lavish 13 inches long, the HDMI 2.0 port outputs clear and crisp 4K visuals at 60Hz and the high-speed data transfers are great. It has the coveted two USB-C data ports plus a PD port, and there’s even a headphone jack. The only thing that holds back a full-throated endorsement is the way our unit handled a streaming light. Having it on at full brightness made the webcam flicker every time. The issue went away at 75 percent brightness, but the same problem didn’t happen on any other hub I tested.\nAnker 341 USB-C Hub (7-in-1)\nThere’s nothing wrong with the Anker 341 USB-C hub. In fact it’s a current recommendation in our iPad accessories guide and it comes at a great $35 price. It gives you two USB-A ports as well as SD slots. But at this point, a 1.4 HDMI connection, which only supports 4K resolution at 30Hz feels a little retro. There’s also just a single USB-C downstream port and the data transfer tests proved to be a touch slower than the other hubs. But if you’ve got a lower resolution monitor and don’t need more than one USB-C, you won’t be disappointed with it.\nAnker 555 8-in-1\nIt was a tough call between the UGreen Revodoc Pro 109 and the Anker 555 8-in-1 for our top recommendation. Both have a similar port array with an HDMI, Ethernet, two USB Type A, a PD USB-C and a USB-C 3.2 on the 555. And the Anker USB-C hub is $15 cheaper. We went with the UGreen hub for its more premium build, extra USB-A port and longer cord that gives you two extra inches to work with. But if you want to save a few bucks this hub is a worthwhile pick. \nStartech 4-Port USB-C Hub (data only)\nI only became aware of Startech when I started researching for this guide. The quality is decent and the yellow accents are a welcome bit of color in the otherwise very gray world of hubs. The performance is solid, with no hiccups that I encountered. The brand’s 4-Port USB-C Hub has a long cord that wraps around the hub itself, which is unique. It doesn’t bother with power delivery, which isn’t an issue if you can power your computer directly. But the four USB ports (three Type-A and one Type-C) max out at 5Gbps and there’s no HDMI connector. It goes for $46, and unfortunately for it, there are cheaper ways to get a few more USB ports for your setup.\nRecent updates\nAugust 2025: Updated to ensure our top picks are still current and accurate.\nApril 2025: Added our experience with the Anker 555 8-in-1 hub to the Other hubs we tested section.  This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-usb-c-hub-120051833.html?src=rss",
    "full_text": "Those spring-loaded ejectors never work on the first try for me, so this is a more elegant solution. There’s just one usable downstream USB-C port; the other is only capable of delivering power to your device. If you'd prefer a DisplayPort connection and don't need the data card slots, check out UGreen's 8-in-1 Revodok hub. They have a pretty similar port array and the Anker USB-C hub is $15 cheaper. Ultimately, its shorter tethered cable and single USB-C port that either delivers power or runs a peripheral led me to prefer Wavlink’s model. The EZQuest Slim Gen 2 hub gives you not just one or two usable Type-C ports, but five of them. That price bump does get you a few features that most hubs don’t have, namely the option of three USB-C ports (one port can be used for either power delivery or accessory support) and dual extended displays with an Apple MacBook (after you download the SiliconMotion driver). On one hand, it feels wasteful to use a perfectly good data port just for boring old electricity. All of this is just to say that aesthetics probably won’t make or break your buying decision. I focused on items that would help with an average day of productivity — not high-end setups or demanding gaming situations."

    "summary": "After seeing the changes coming with iOS 26, we're ready to finally see Apple's newest collection of smartphones: the iPhone 17 lineup. While that's still more than a month away — assuming Apple sticks to its usual release schedule — we haven't been left completely in the dark about what the new phones will look like. As with most unreleased iPhone models,  rumors and leaks have trickled in about the hardware side ahead of the official introduction. Here's what we're expecting and what we can reasonably assume we'll get from Cupertino in September.\nWhat are the latest iPhone 17 rumors and reports?\nAgain, not all iPhone rumors are created equal, and all should be taken with a grain of salt. The latest comes from a MacRumors report which says the internal battery pack of the new superthin iPhone Air (see below) is just 2.49mm thick — half the thickness of the iPhone 17 Pro battery. The leak was posted on the Korean-langauge Naver blog, where they show the alleged batteries of the iPhone 17 Air and 17 Pro side by side. The same account claimed the 17 Air's battery capacity was a mere 2,800 mAh, MacRumors notes. (That's below the battery capacity of current iPhone 16 models.) \nWhen will the iPhone 17 series be announced?\nMost years, the flagship smartphones are introduced in September. It's a little early to have the specific dates; some years, Apple only gives a week or two of lead time between sending invites and hosting the event. But years of past precedent show that sometime in September should be when the 17 models make their debut. This family of smartphones may be the last to follow that trend, however. There have been hints that the introduction of the iPhone 18 collection in 2026 will be split into a pro-tier announcement in the fall and a standard model announcement the following spring.\nWhat will the new iPhone 17 lineup include?\nDesign leaks suggest that Apple is building an ultra-thin smartphone, likely to be named the iPhone 17 Air to match Apple's ultralight laptop designation. Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, often a solid source of advanced intel about Apple, reported in January that the iPhone 17 Air will be equipped with a basic A19 chip and will only have a single camera lens. It may also use Apple's new in-house modem, which was introduced in February on the iPhone 16e. More details about this development may leak ahead of September, but that's what we know for now.\nAn investor note from Apple analyst Jeff Pu indicated that the Air will have a titanium frame. If his reports are accurate, the lightweight smartphone will be the only entry in the iPhone 17 lineup to use that metal; the iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone 17 Pro Max are expected to be made of aluminum, which is oddly a lighter material than titanium. Other speculation had suggested that the Air would use a blend of aluminum and titanium, so the exact materials may not be known until the official announcement.\nEach new roster includes a base model, but over the years, Apple shakes up the variety of phones it offers. Most likely there will be an iPhone 17 and an iPhone 17 Pro. Apple has also committed to the size matters philosophy, and has been building an iPhone Pro Max option with an even bigger screen and better battery life; the 17 roster will almost certainly have one as well. \nThe new Pro iPhones are said to have a full-width \"camera island\" on the rear, which would mark the first time an Apple model opted for that design. This feature can be seen in the the purported iPhone 17 \"spotted in the wild.\" The pics, highlighted on MacRumors, show a black cased iPhone (17 Pro?) with the distinct back panel. Is it the real deal? The dual angles lend a degree of credibility in a social media landscape increasingly polluted with AI-enhanced fakes, but your guess is as good as ours.\nI just spotted a test development iPhone in the wild 🤩🤩🤩 pic.twitter.com/iS3PtKWqxJ— Fox Pupy 🦊🧡 (@Skyfops) July 28, 2025\n\nThe iPhone 17 Air seems primed to take the place of a potential iPhone 17 Plus. Since the iPhone 16e was only just introduced in February at a surprisingly high price point, it seems unlikely that there will be a new addition to that lower end of the spectrum, the models that were previously called SE. \nAt the very least, it sounds like the iPhone 17 Air won't take away the charging port and rely only on wireless connectivity. Bloomberg said that while Apple had investigated making the iPhone 17 Air without a single port, the company (fortunately) changed plans. He also says that the rumored phone will have a 6.6-inch screen and include the Dynamic Island and Camera Control button. Finally, the price is rumored at $900 — likely more than the standard iPhone 17 but less than the Pro.\nWe've also gotten what seems to be a reliable look at what the color lineup will be for the new smartphones. Macworld reported that the iPhone 17 will be available in black, white, steel gray, green, purple and light blue. The iPhone 17 Air will reportedly have four color options: black, white, light blue and light gold. While the Air colors will be less saturated, the visuals for the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max will go bold. The options for the Pro models are expected to be black, white, gray, dark blue and orange.\nOn July 30, Tom's Guide highlighted an X post from Sonny Dickson — a longtime and generally reliable leaker of unreleased iPhone information — showing \"dummy\" iPhone 17 models in the new colors that were the source of the aforementioned Macworld story. While these are literally just mock-ups — not real, leaked iPhones — it's interesting to see how the design and color rumors translate into a real-world look and feel.\nWhat will iOS 26 be like?\nApple upended its numbering conventions with WWDC 2025, and will match the name of each new operating system to the year it's released. So when the next wave of iPhones hits, they'll be running on iOS 26.\nOn the design side, the smartphone OS introduced during the big developer showcase took a contentious approach dubbed Liquid Glass. Apple has been scaling down the amount of transparency effects in the subsequent beta tests of iOS 26, but it will still have a glass-like visual.\nThe feature list includes big and small updates. On the more impactful side, the Phone and Photos apps have been redesigned. There will be several features leveraging artificial intelligence, such as live translation capabilities coming to Phone, FaceTime and Messages. Apple is also currently testing a sensitive content warning for child accounts that will freeze FaceTime video if nudity is detected by on-device machine learning tools. And the company is also launching Visual Intelligence, which will use AI to search for elements in an image.\niOS 26 also has a litany of minor, quality of life improvements. Group texts are getting support for polls. And for the slow risers out there, iOS 26 will finally let you escape the tyranny of the nine minute snooze alarm. \nThe next iOS is now available as a public beta. Here are our initial impressions of the Liquid Glass design and other new features. iOS 26 is compatible with all models back through iPhone 11.\nUpdate, August 4, 2025, 5:23PM ET: Added latest battery leaks about the iPhone 17 models.\nUpdate, August 1, 2025, 8:15AM ET: Added new photos showing potential iPhone 17 colors.\nUpdate, July 30, 2025, 11:08AM ET: Added latest leaks and rumors about the iPhone 17, and updated information on the iOS 26 public beta.\nUpdate, July 17, 2025, 4:40PM ET: Added latest information about iOS 26, possible materials for the Air, and the color options for the different models.\nUpdate, March 17, 2025, 2PM ET: Added details about the rumored price and features of the iPhone 17 Air.\nUpdate, April 11, 2025, 3:45PM ET: Added details from Front Page Tech's new video that claims to reveal details from a leaked iOS 19 build.\nKatie Teague contributed to this story.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/iphone-17-pro-max-and-air-release-dates-colors-and-everything-else-you-need-to-know-about-apples-new-phones-153024847.html?src=rss",
    "full_text": "But years of past precedent show that sometime in September should be when the 17 models make their debut. This family of smartphones may be the last to follow that trend, however. It may also use Apple's new in-house modem, which was introduced in February on the iPhone 16e. More details about this development may leak ahead of September, but that's what we know for now. An investor note from Apple analyst Jeff Pu indicated that the Air will have a titanium frame. Apple has also committed to the size matters philosophy, and has been building an iPhone Pro Max option with an even bigger screen and better battery life; the 17 roster will almost certainly have one as well.

    "summary": "Liquid Glass is a huge new change coming to iOS 26. (Apple)\nYou've seen all the changes coming to your iPhone and now you're desperately ready to upgrade to iOS 26 — but it's only August and the operating system won't be here until this fall. But I have good news: you can test out all the features now by downloading and installing Apple's public beta, which CEO Tim Cook says is (along with the other current beta operating systems) \"by far the most popular developer betas we’ve had,\" 9to5Mac reports. You can also take a look at our preview of the iOS 26 public beta release, which shows off the fresh home and lock screen redesign. Called Liquid Glass, the new translucent look will extend across all of Apple's upcoming operating systems. The overhaul is one of several big changes coming to iOS, macOS, iPadOS and the rest of Apple's software suite, all of which were showcased during the company's WWDC keynote on June 9. \nAfter overpromising on AI plans last year, Apple kept its iOS roadmap focused more on basic quality of life improvements this year. There are multiple useful additions coming to the Phone and Messages apps on your iPhone, for instance: Apple execs outlined the ability to weed out spam texts or other unknown senders and an option to hold your spot on a phone call when you've been waiting for a representative to pick up. Plus, a treasured feature that we took for granted is coming back (hint: it's in the Photos app).\nSiri, meanwhile, is in a holding pattern. Apple has previously specified that its smarter voice assistant — first promised at WWDC 2024 — is delayed until some point \"in the coming year,\" so you shouldn't expect any major changes in the current betas. But there are reports that Apple is aiming to give Siri a bigger brain transplant by basing it on third-party artificial intelligence models like OpenAI's ChatGPT or Anthropic's Claude, which could make 2026 a pivotal year. The company is also reportedly working on a 'stripped-down' AI chatbot to rival ChatGPT.\nWith each beta, it seems like additional new improvements are popping up, like this FaceTime feature that'll freeze your video if it detects nudity. Most newer iPhone models are eligible to download iOS 26 (both the betas and final version). Want to see the full list of new features coming this fall? Read on.  \nWhat is iOS 26?\nThe current iPhone operating system is iOS 18, and Apple is still actively updating it — version 18.6 was just recently released. But don't expect to see iOS 19. Instead, Apple is skipping the numbering ahead to iOS 26 later this year. The company has decided to line up its iOS version numbers with a year-based system, similar to car model years. So while iOS and its sibling operating systems will be released in late 2025, they're all designated \"26\" to reflect the year ahead. (Meanwhile, iOS 18 is still getting new versions this summer, too.)\nIt's official, we're moving to iOS 26. (Apple)\nWhat is Liquid Glass design?\nLet's be honest. Out of everything announced at WWDC this year, the new Liquid Glass design was the star of the show. The iPhone's home and lock screens have looked pretty much the same year after year — the last exciting thing (in my opinion) was the option to add your own aesthetic to your home screen by customizing your apps and widgets. So seeing the home and lock screens' new facelift is refreshing.\nSo what exactly is Liquid Glass? Apple calls it a \"new translucent material\" since, well, the apps and widgets are clear. However, the screen can still adapt to dark and light modes, depending on surroundings. You'll also notice buttons with a new floating design in several apps, like Phone and Maps. They're designed to be less distracting than the current buttons, but are still easy to see. While the design overhaul has proven to be controversial since its announcement, some — including Engadget's own Devindra Hardawar — like the new direction, even if it's somewhat reminiscent of Microsoft's translucent Windows Vista Aero designs from nearly twenty years ago.\nThat said, as of the release of the iOS 26 beta 2, Apple has already incorporated some user feedback into the design, dialing back the transparency in at least some places. And while it will continue to evolve, Apple users won't be able to escape it: Liquid Glass was designed to make all of Apple's OSes more cohesive. Here's a look at how the translucent aesthetic will look with the new macOS Tahoe 26 on your desktop.\nWhat are the new and notable features of iOS 26?\niOS 26 has a laundry list of new features. Among the most worthwhile:\nPhone app redesign: You'll finally be able to scroll through contacts, recent calls and voicemail messages all on one screen. It also comes with a new feature called Hold Assist that'll notify you when an agent comes to the phone so you can avoid the elevator music and continue on with other tasks.\nLive Translation in Phone, FaceTime and Messages: iOS 26 is bringing the ability to have a conversation via phone call or text message with someone who speaks another language. Live Translation will translate your conversation in real time, which results in some stop-and-go interactions in the examples Apple shared during its presentation.\nPolls in group chats: Tired of sorting through what seems like hundreds of messages in your group chat? You and your friends will soon be able to create polls in group messages for deciding things like which brunch spot you're eating at or whose car you're taking on a road trip.\nFiltering unknown senders in Messages: If you haven't received spam texts about unpaid tolls or other citations, you're lucky. For those of us who have, those annoying messages will soon be filtered away in a separate folder.\nVisual Intelligence: Similar to a reverse Google image search, this new feature will allow you to search for anything that's on your iPhone screen. For instance, if you spot a pair of shoes someone is wearing in an Instagram photo, you can screenshot it and use Visual Intelligence to find those shoes (or similar ones) online.\nPhotos tabs are back: For anyone who's still frustrated with the Photos changes made last year, you'll be happy to know that your tabs are coming back. Library and Collections will have their own separate spaces so you don't have to scroll to infinity to find what you're looking for.\nFaceTime \"Communication Safety\" feature: A newer addition to iOS 26 appears to be the FaceTime \"Communication Safety\" feature that pauses communications if and when nudity is detected. The feature appears to be a child safety feature that uses on-device detection, thus obviating any cloud-based privacy issues. \nApple's Hold Assist will be nifty for those pesky services that put you on hold for 10 or more minutes. (Apple)\nWhich iPhones will be able to upgrade to iOS 26?\nA few iPhone models that run the current version of iOS — iPhone XR, XS and XS Max — won't be compatible with the latest upgrade. But any iPhones released in 2019 or later will be eligible for the iOS 26 update.\n\niPhone SE (second generation or later)\niPhone 11\niPhone 11 Pro\niPhone 11 Pro Max\niPhone 12\niPhone 12 mini\niPhone 12 Pro\niPhone 12 Pro Max\niPhone 13\niPhone 13 mini\niPhone 13 Pro\niPhone 13 Pro Max\niPhone 14\niPhone 14 Plus\niPhone 14 Pro\niPhone 14 Pro Max\niPhone 15\niPhone 15 Plus\niPhone 15 Pro\niPhone 15 Pro Max\niPhone 16e\niPhone 16\niPhone 16 Plus\niPhone 16 Pro\niPhone 16 Pro Max\n\nNot listed here are the presumed new iPhone 17 models (or maybe iPhone 26?) that are all but certain to be announced and released in September. \nHow to install iOS 26 beta\nThe iOS 26 public beta is now available to download via the Apple Beta Software Program. If you're not already a member, you'll need to sign up to try out all the latest features. Just visit beta.apple.com and sign up with your phone number or email address. It's free.\nOnce you're in, you can install it by going to Settings > General > Software Update and selecting iOS 26 public beta.\nA word of caution: Don't sign up with your main iPhone unless you're OK with any risks that occur with using an OS that isn't finalized.\nWhen will the final version of iOS 26 be released?\niOS 26 will be released to the public this fall. It usually comes in September, within a week of the Apple iPhone event. Last year, it rolled out to iPhone users on September 16 — exactly one week after the iPhone 16 lineup was announced.\nIf you're more interested in the Apple Intelligence features coming, here's everything Apple revealed for iOS, macOS and more during WWDC. Also, check out how iOS 26 screenshots could be an intriguing preview of Apple's delayed Siri rework.\nUpdate, August 4: Noted that Apple is reportedly working on a ChatGPT rival.\nUpdate, August 1: Added quote from Tim Cook about iOS 26.\nUpdate, July 31: Noted that iOS 18.6 is now available. \nUpdate, July 24: Noted the iOS 26 public beta is now available.\nUpdate, July 3: Noted new FaceTime feature found in the developer beta.\nUpdate, June 30: Noted ongoing iOS 18 releases, and reports that Apple is considering additional external LLMs for Siri. \nUpdate, June 25: Noted changes added in iOS 26 beta 2. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/apple-ios-26-beta-how-to-download-the-update-on-your-iphone-new-features-like-liquid-glass-and-everything-else-you-need-to-know-135749293.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "\nIf you're a devoted iPhone owner like me, you'll be excited to check out all the exciting new updates coming to Apple's operating system this fall: iOS 26. The coolest change, in my opinion, is the new Liquid Glass design (think Windows Vista, but arguably more thoughtful), which looks to be Apple's largest visual update in years. We spent two weeks test-driving it — you can check out our detailed hands-on iOS 26 preview, or you can try it out yourself by downloading and installing the public beta, available now. (While the beta is open to the public and stable, always remember there's a degree of risk involved with beta software.) Not ready to upgrade your smartphone this year? No worries, we'll help you find out if your phone will be able to run iOS 26.\nLast year, Apple didn't nix any iPhones from its eligibility list, but that's not the case for 2025 — a few models are getting cut this time. All iPhone 8 models and the iPhone X were the last to get the boot in 2023, and this year the 2018 models are getting left behind. If you have an ineligible device, you won't be able to download iOS 26 when it becomes available this fall.\nWe'll get to the bottom of which iPhones will support iOS 26 this year. To see what's coming with the latest OS and more, check out everything announced at Apple's WWDC June 9 event. One thing you shouldn't immediately expect is Apple's updated version of Siri, though the company is reportedly working on a 'stripped-down' AI chatbot to compete with ChatGPT.\nThese three iPhones won't be compatible with iOS 26\nUnlike last year, several iPhone models won't be eligible to download the newest iOS when it makes its debut this fall.

However, you'll miss out on security updates which could potentially put your phone at risk for malware and other threats. Additionally, some apps may stop working if they require a certain version of iOS or later. And of course, you won't be able to access the latest features iOS 26 offers.\nWhen will iOS 26 become available?\nApple usually rolls out its latest iOS in mid-September, just a few days before the new iPhones hit store shelves. Last year, it released iOS 18 on Monday, Sept. 16. Expect a confirmation of the release date at the iPhone 17 event, expected in early September. \niOS 26 features we're excited about\nLiquid Glass design: Your home screen is getting revamped with new app icons, including dark mode and all-clear options.

The company says that the ban \"reduces competition, decreases consumer choice and drives up consumer costs and inconvenience.\" Rivian believes Ohio's law is particularly unfair because it contains a carveout for the company's competitor Tesla.\nOhio currently requires the state DMV to not provide a dealership license to \"a manufacturer, or a parent company, subsidiary, or affiliated entity of a manufacturer, applying for a license to sell or lease new or used motor vehicles at retail.\" The law keeps car sales in the hands of independently owned car dealerships — except for Tesla. An exception was created for Tesla in 2014, The Columbus Dispatch writes, after the EV maker reached an agreement with the Ohio Dealership Association. Now cars in the state are sold through traditional car dealerships, and three dealerships owned and operated by Tesla.\n\"Rivian believes that consumers should be able to choose the vehicles they purchase,\" Rivian's Chief Administrative Officer Mike Callahan shared in a statement. \"Consumer choice is a bedrock principle of America's economy. Ohio's archaic prohibition against the direct-sales of vehicles is unconstitutional, irrational and harms Ohioans by reducing competition and choice and driving up costs and inconvenience.\"\nThe company's lawsuit does a good job of laying out the illogical situation Ohio has created with its ban. Rivian is allowed to perform repairs on cars in the state and deliver cars purchased out-of-state to Ohioans. \"Nonsensically, the thing that Rivian cannot do is actually complete the sale of Rivian vehicles in Ohio,\" the company writes. \"This imposes an extraordinary burden on Ohio consumers and Rivian for no legitimate reason.\"\nAs The Verge notes, bans on direct car sales have historically exist to prevent large, established car companies from having a monopoly on the sale of their own cars. Going direct to consumer is one of the ways EV makers have differentiated themselves from older brands, something companies like Tesla and Rivian can't do in states with bans. Rivian could try and strike a deal like Tesla, but filing a federal lawsuit suggests the company could be aiming to win a bigger, more lasting change. Rivian has achieved similar wins in the past. The state of Illinois sued to stop Rivian and Lucid Motors from selling directly to consumers in 2022, but ultimately lost.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/rivian-sues-ohio-dmv-over-partial-ban-on-direct-car-sales-191259497.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "To tackle what's been called the plastic \"epidemic,\" the UN spun up a committee in 2022 tasked with brokering a legally binding global agreement. This ambitious treaty between UN member states was to address the full life cycle of plastics, from production to disposal: In short, define what counts as plastic pollution and curb the sorts of unchecked production that inevitably leads to it. But across five sessions since, countries have failed to reach a consensus on the text.\nWhat was meant to be the final session ended last year in Busan, South Korea without agreement, and representatives from 175 countries are now set to meet again for part two, this time in Geneva, Switzerland. INC-5.2 will take place from August 5 to 14, during which negotiators will attempt to see eye-to-eye on the points of the draft treaty that have thus far proven most contentious. According to the Center for International Environmental Law (CIEL), there are over 370 such points.\nScope\nProduction, the use of chemicals of concern (those considered to be a risk due to toxicity and/or other qualities), product design and the financing of treaty implementation are some of the main points of disagreement. These issues have left countries in a deadlock, according to Cate Bonacini, Communications Manager for CIEL. There are countries that argue health should be excluded from the treaty's scope. These topics will be front-and-center going back into the talks, and UN member states have spent the last eight months \"working hard in closed-door meetings to find points of agreement,\" Bonacini said in an email. \"We’ll see the fruits of that labor soon.\"\n\"At the heart of the issue,\" Bonacini said, \"there is a large disagreement about what plastic pollution is, and what measures are needed to end plastic pollution.\" While the commitment focuses on the full life cycle of plastics, there's been much dispute over where that cycle really begins.\n\"As scientists, we interpret the full life cycle as starting with extraction and production,\" said Bethanie Carney Almroth, a professor of ecotoxicology at the University of Gothenburg and a member of the Scientists' Coalition for an Effective Plastics Treaty. \"That would be fossil fuels and raw plastic production all the way through to product, to use, to trade, to transportation, to waste management, mismanagement and environmental pollution, including remediation of existing legacy plastics. All of it.\"\nWhile over 100 countries last December were in favor of a treaty that would impose production limits, others including Saudi Arabia and Russia opposed the caps. Ahead of that session, the US reportedly also made the decision not to support production caps, despite earlier indications that it would. Unsurprisingly, the countries that have taken issue with the scope of the treaty are also some of the world's top oil producers.\n\"There are other actors,\" Carney Almroth said, \"that are trying to narrow that scope to go from plastic products, like water bottles, to waste management, so sort of excluding the outer boundaries of how we define the plastics life cycle so that it would, in essence, become more of a waste management treaty.\"\nOutside influence\nIn addition to representatives from the participating member states, scientists, environmental organizations and industry lobbyists are present for the negotiation sessions. According to Carney Almroth, who has attended every Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee (INC) meeting and is now in Geneva for INC-5.2, increasingly it's been lobbyists who take up the most space.\n\"At the last round of talks, lobbyists for the petrochemical and plastics industries made up the single largest delegation,\" wrote Bangor University lecturer Winnie Courtene-Jones, who is also a member of the Coalition, in a recent article for The Conversation. CIEL found that \"there were three times more fossil fuel and chemical industry lobbyists than scientists\" at the Busan meetings. Bonacini noted that \"plastics are 99 percent fossil fuels, and these companies have a vested interest in continuing to generate fossil fuel-based products, including plastics.\"\nTheir influence has played a big role in the stalemate. They \"have a lot of power, money and influence,\" Carney Almroth said, \"and their lobbying efforts go beyond the walls of the negotiating space…They have access to decision makers in ways that other observers do not.\"\n\"They don't want to look at chemicals,\" Carney Almroth said. \"They don't want to look at production.\" But the science indicates that looking at chemicals (additives, processing aids, etc.) and production is of utmost importance, not only in the context of environmental sustainability but also human health.\nIn an editorial for the Bulletin of the World Health Organization in July, a group of scientists pointed to the numerous potential health effects that recent studies have linked to plastics, via exposure to hazardous chemicals and from micro- and nanoplastics. That includes an increased risk of \"multiple chronic diseases, including cancer, neurodevelopmental harm and infertility\" as well as \"respiratory, reproductive and gastrointestinal harm, with potential links to lung and colon cancer.\"\nThe authors called on delegates to prioritize these concerns in the upcoming negotiations and work toward a treaty that would end production of toxic chemicals in plastics, ban the recycling of plastics containing those chemicals and reduce plastic production overall. Their letter comes alongside a separate study published this summer in the journal Nature that identified over 4,200 chemicals of concern in plastics, out of the 16,325 total known plastic chemicals. The researchers argue that, on top of establishing transparency around the makeup of plastics and removing chemicals of concern, plastics must be simplified if they're going to be made safer.\nThe many chemicals that go into plastics \"can be released throughout the entire plastic life cycle, from feedstock extraction and production to use and waste,\" the authors write. \"Specific end-of-life treatments, such as uncontrolled landfilling or incineration, can further exacerbate chemical releases.\" The UN has warned that the negative effects at every stage in the life cycle of plastics disproportionately harm vulnerable populations worldwide, including indigenous peoples, low income families and rural communities.\nWhere things stand\nToday, plastic is more or less inescapable — microplastics can even be found in Antarctica now. And research increasingly suggests we aren't fully aware of how bad pollution levels really are.\nGlobal plastic production has more than doubled in the last 25 years, with upwards of 450 million metric tons now estimated to be produced annually. Recycled plastics make up just 6 percent of that total, a figure that's expected to stay the same even as global plastic use and waste generation are projected to rise 70 percent by 2040, according to the international Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). And each year, tens of millions of tons of plastic waste is disposed of in ways considered to be environmentally unsound, ending up in uncontrolled dumpsites, burned openly or accumulating on land and in bodies of water.\nA study published this summer, led by researchers from Utrecht University and the Royal Netherlands Institute for Sea Research, found that there may be far more plastic in the oceans than previously thought when accounting for particles even smaller than microplastics. The team collected water samples from 12 locations across the North Atlantic Ocean and measured the concentration of nanoplastics (plastic particles under 1 micrometer) at different depths. By the researchers' estimate, there could be as much as 27 million metric tons of nanoplastic in the North Atlantic alone. That's in the ballpark of previous global estimates for larger plastic waste across all of the ocean.\nIn another new study, researchers from France's University of Toulouse found we may be breathing in up to 100 times more microplastic particles indoors than previous estimates, based on measurements of airborne microplastics in the researchers' own apartments and car cabins.\nThe situation is urgent, especially for vulnerable populations, said Carney Almroth. \"The amounts of plastics we're producing today and the amount of plastic in the environment are astronomical,\" said Carney Almroth. As of a few years ago, \"we had twice the mass of plastic on the planet as the mass of all the animals on land, in water, including insects, and we have produced far more plastic since then.\"\nPlastics are \"overwhelming any and all of our waste management infrastructure, so we are not able to prevent pollution. We're not able to mitigate harm,\" Carney Almroth said. \"The impacts of plastics in the environment are very large scale, to the point where they're destabilizing vital Earth functions like climate, like nutrient cycling, like biodiversity. And then we have the human health impacts on top of that. It's an acute problem.\"\nThe logistics of averting catastrophe\nBut, as the past five sessions have illustrated, reaching an agreement on how to solve that problem isn't going to be easy. The trouble, in part, boils down to how the decisions are being made. So far, it's all being done by consensus rather than voting, Carney Almroth and Bonacini explained. That approach allows \"a single country veto power over decisions,\" Bonacini said.\nPetrochemical countries including Saudi Arabia, Russia, China, Iran, Kuwait, Qatar, India and Brazil have reportedly latched onto this, using \"obstructionist tactics\" to drag out the negotiations. Some have insisted \"without legal basis,\" according to CIEL, \"that decisions can only be made by consensus.\" Consensus, however, isn't the only option.\nThe draft Rules of Procedure allow for majority voting in the event a consensus can't be reached, but whether that will happen is yet to be seen. \"There are opportunities to force that rule,\" Carney Almroth said. But, a country (or countries) would have to step up and invoke it.\nAt this stage of the negotiations, there is a risk that countries will compromise on key provisions for time's sake, Bonacini said, which would ultimately weaken the treaty. And once a treaty is finalized, \"it can take years, if not decades, to make amendments to the original text,\" so getting it right the first time is crucial. International agreements that have taken a softer approach to addressing environmental issues, like the Paris Agreement — which lets countries set their own targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions — have been criticized for being insufficient in the face of rapidly rising global temperatures and climate change.\nIn June at the UN Ocean Conference, representatives for 95 countries that are part of the INC reaffirmed their commitment to a treaty that addresses the full life cycle of plastics, phases out \"the most problematic plastic products and chemicals of concern,\" improves product design to reduce environmental and health impacts and employs effective means of implementation. \"A treaty that lacks these elements, only relies on voluntary measures or does not address the full lifecycle of plastics will not be effective to deal with the challenge of plastic pollution,\" the group — which includes Canada, Australia, Colombia, Zimbabwe, the UK and Germany — wrote in a joint statement. These countries added that \"the treaty should provide for the possibility of decision-making, through regular UN procedures if all efforts to reach consensus have been exhausted.\"\nIf an agreement isn't reached this time around, there are a number of ways the next steps could play out. The talks could be stretched even further into another meeting, or countries could decide to take the matter somewhere else.\n\"Many countries are considering alternatives if negotiations fail,\" Christina Dixon, Ocean Campaign Lead for the Environmental Investigation Agency told Mongabay. \"Options include returning to the United Nations Environment Assembly (UNEA) to establish a new expanding mandate, creating a convention outside the UN for committed countries to move forward or adopting a protocol under an existing convention.\" The UNEA meets next in December.\nWe are, as Courtene-Jones wrote in The Conversation, at \"a critical crossroads.\" That's something advocates for a strong, science-based treaty all seem to agree on. \"There are a lot of places where we can really do a lot to make a difference, and make things better,\" said Carney Almroth. \"Countries need to be ambitious, and need to stand up and demand this.\"This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/science/will-the-un-finally-broker-a-treaty-to-end-plastic-pollution-130022025.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "It’s obvious that Apple products are some of the most sought-after in the tech world — that means sales are fewer and farther between than other gadgets, and they’re often the first things to sell out when discounts do arrive. But it would be a mistake to assume you’re doomed to always pay full price on things like iPads and Apple Watches. Apple deals to exist, if you know where to look.Engadget keeps track of deals like these on a regular basis, so we can help you there. Below, we’ve collected the best Apple deals you can get right now on items like AirPods, MacBooks, iPads and more. Arguably the biggest caveat to note about Apple sales is that you’re almost never going to see discounts directly at Apple.com. Unless you shop refurbished, you’ll always pay top dollar direct at Apple, and for some things (like iPhones), that might be best. But you’ll find more discounts more often if you’re willing to shop at retailers like Amazon, Best Buy, Walmart, Target and others.\nBest MacBook deals\n \nApple MacBook Air (15-inch, M4) for $999 ($200 off): The 15-inch MacBook Air is nearly identical to the smaller version but features more robust speakers and a more spacious trackpad alongside its roomier display. $999 is the lowest price we've tracked.\nApple MacBook Air (15-inch, M3, 24GB RAM) for $1,299 ($400 off): The last-gen M3 MacBook Air has officially been discontinued, but it remains a superb laptop while the last bits of stock remain available. We gave this 15-inch model a score of 90 in our review — outside of its slower chip (which is still plenty fast for everyday use), marginally improved camera and inability to power two external displays with the lid open, it's virtually identical to the newer version. This deal applies to the model with the larger 24GB of memory in the Starlight colorway.\nApple iMac 24-inch (M4) for $1,185 (9 percent off): For an all-in-one solution, the M4 iMac is a good pick thanks to its powerful performance, standard 16GB of RAM and improved webcam. Just note that it only comes in the 24-inch screen size option. $1,149 is the lowest price we've tracked, but note that the deal only applies to the Pink model. Other colors are also on sale, but more expensive. \nBest Apple Watch deals\n \nApple Watch Ultra 2 for $650 ($149 off): Apple’s most premium smartwatch, the Ultra 2 has a killer 36-hour battery life, a handy Low Power mode for extended use and cellular connectivity by default. It also has a compass app, water temperature gauge and a loud onboard siren that you can trigger in emergencies. This deal applies to the watch with the orange band. $650 is the lowest price we've tracked. \nApple Watch SE for $169 (32 percent off): We wouldn’t be surprised to see an update to Apple’s budget smartwatch sometime soon (and we have a few suggestions on the matter). But thanks to some serious discounts, the Apple Watch SE has turned out to be the most affordable way to get an iPhone companion for your wrist. Despite the lackluster screen and limited extra features, it handles the basics well. Also available at Walmart.\nBest AirPods deals\n \nAirPods Max (USB-C) for $450 ($99 off): If you’re looking for over-ear headphones with all of the conveniences of in-ear AirPods, the AirPods Max are one of your only options (with the others being Beats devices). The latest models have the same design as the originals, but now charge up via USB-C instead of Lightning. They went as low as $430 for Amazon's Prime Day. \nBest iPad deals\n \niPad Pro (M4, 11-inch) for $899 ($100 off): The most powerful iPad is the iPad Pro, and it’s the one to get if you’re even toying with the idea of using your new slab as a laptop replacement. Both the 11- and 13-inch models have gorgeous displays, thinner and lighter designs, a repositioned front camera and the excessively powerful M4 chip inside. Also at B&H Photo.\nBest Apple accessories deals\nApple Pencil (USB-C) for $69 ($10 off): This more affordable Apple Pencil doesn’t support pressure sensitivity, but it still makes for a useful stylus for the basics. If you’re a casual note-taker and can live without wireless charging, you’ll save a few bucks by picking this one up. Also available at Walmart.\nApple Pencil (2nd gen) for $99 ($30 off): The Second gen Pencil both attaches and charges magnetically, supports tilt and pressure sensitivity and allows for tool changes with a tap of the flat edge. It’s an older pencil and isn’t compatible with the latest iPad models. This is the lowest price we’ve tracked this year, but it went as low as $80 for last year’s Black Friday sales.\nRead more Apple coverage:\n\nThe best AirPods\nThe best Apple Watches\nThe best MacBooks\nThe best iPhones\nThe best iPads\n\nFollow @EngadgetDeals on X for the latest tech deals and buying advice.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/best-apple-deals-150020110.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Most people think of AirTags when they picture a Bluetooth tracker. And indeed, Apple’s little white discs used to be the most capable option, relying on a vast finding network of nearby iPhones to pinpoint lost tags. But now, both Google and Samsung have implemented finding networks of their own. And other Bluetooth tracker companies, like Chipolo and Pebblebee, now have trackers that pair with either Google or Apple’s network too. In short, you’ve got a lot of options for tagging and tracking your keys, backpacks, luggage and more. So we tested all the major brands out there to see how they work and put together a guide to help you get the most out of your chosen tracker. Here are the best Bluetooth trackers you can buy.\nTable of contents\n\nThe best Bluetooth trackers for 2025\nWhat to look for in a Bluetooth tracking device\nHow we tested Bluetooth trackers \nOther Bluetooth trackers we tested \nBluetooth tracker FAQs\n\nBest Bluetooth trackers for 2025\n \n \n \n \nWhat to look for in a Bluetooth tracking device\nBluetooth trackers are small discs or cards that rely on short-range, low-energy wireless signals to communicate with your smartphone. Attach one of these gadgets your stuff and, if it’s in range, your phone can “ring” the chip so you can find it. These tracking devices offer other features like separation alerts to tell you when you’ve left a tagged item behind, or where a lost item was last detected. Some can even tap into a larger network of smartphones to track down your device when you’re out of range. Depending on what you want the tracker to do, there are a few specs to look for when deciding which to get. \nDevice compatibility\nLike most things from the folks in Cupertino, AirTags only work with products in the Apple ecosystem. Both Apple and Google have opened up access to the Find My and Find Hub networks to third-party manufacturers, including Chipolo and Pebblebee. Those two companies make device-agnostic models that will work with the larger tracking network from either brand, so iPhone and Android users can buy the same tag. Tile trackers work with either Android or Apple devices, but use Tile’s own Life 360 finding network. Samsung’s latest fob, the Galaxy SmartTag2, only works with Samsung phones and taps into a finding system that relies on other Samsung devices to locate lost tags.\nFinding network\nCrowd-sourced finding capabilities are what make headlines, with stories about recovering stolen equipment or tracking lost luggage across the globe. Using anonymous signals that ping other people’s devices, these Bluetooth tracking devices can potentially tell you where a tagged item is, even if your smartphone is out of Bluetooth range.\nApple’s Find My network is the largest, with over a billion iPhones and iPads in service all running Apple’s Find My app by default. So unless an iPhone user opts out, their phone silently acts as a location detector for any nearby AirTags. Apple recently increased the AirTag’s finding power by enabling you to share the location of a lost tag with a third party, party, like an airline. Chipolo fobs that work on Apple’s network have the same ability. Google launched its Find My Device network in 2024 and has since renamed it Find Hub, which, like Apple's fining app, combines devices and people finding in one place. That network is now a close second for the largest in the US\nNow that Google’s Find Hub network is up and running, it’s a close second for the largest in the US. Like Apple, Android users are automatically part of the network, but can opt-out by selecting the Google services option in their phone’s Settings app and toggling the option in the Find Hub menu. Samsung’s SmartTag 2 and related network also defaults to an opt-in status for finding tags and other devices.\nTile offers a large finding grid that includes Tile users, Amazon Sidewalk customers and people running the Life360 network. Life360 acquired Tile in 2021, and, according to the company, the Life360 network has more than 70 million monthly active users.\nIn our tests, AirTags and third-party tags using its network, like the Chipolo Pop and Pebblebee Clip Universal, were the fastest to track down lost items. They offered nearly real-time location data in moderately to heavily trafficked spots around Albuquerque, including a bar, bookstore and coffee shops in Nob Hill, along with various outdoor hangouts on UNM’s campus.\nSamsung's SmartTags were able to locate our lost items most of the time, though not with the same precision finding accuracy as AirTags. When we tested Google’s Find Hub (then called Find My Device) network right after launch, it was noticeably slower than Apple’s network when using the community finding feature. Testing it again in 2025, the time it took to locate a lost item was considerably improved, taking just a couple minutes for the community to track a fob. In our tests, Tile’s finding network wasn’t able to consistently locate its lost fobs.\n\n\n\n\n   Amy Skorheim / Engadget \n \n\nSeparation alerts\nHere’s where a tracker’s day-to-day utility really shines. A separation alert lets you know when you’ve traveled too far from your tagged items, which is useful if you want to make sure your laptop bag, or jacket or umbrella always comes with you when you leave the house.\nThese notifications work when you’re out and about too. If you’ve got a Bluetooth tracking device in your wallet and walk out of a restaurant without it, the separation alert should kick in, resulting in fewer lost items. This feature also tells you where your tagged item and phone were last paired, allowing you to retrace your steps if you happen to miss the alert.\nEach tracker handles left-behind items differently. AirTags and third-party fobs using its network (such as from Chipolo or Pebblebee) include the feature by default. Tile trackers require a yearly subscription to enable the alerts (currently $30 annually). Tags working with the Google's Find Hub network don’t offer the feature at all, but Chipolo Pop tags can issue left-behind alerts using its own Android app. Both AirTags and Tiles allow you to turn off separation alerts at certain locations, meaning you can set your home as a “safe” place where items can be left behind, but alerts will still trigger elsewhere.\nIn our tests, AirTags and others using the Find My network alerted us between the 600- and 1,400-foot mark. Tiles sent a notification after about an average of 1,500 feet and were more consistent when using an Android phone than an iPhone. Chipolo Pop tags paired with an Android phone and using its own app sent an alert when we got around 450 feet away from our tagged item.\nConnectivity, volume and design\nThe feature you may use most often is the key finder function, which makes the tracker ring when you hit a button in the app. With Apple's AirTags, you can say \"Hey Siri, where are my keys?\" and the assistant will ring the tag (assuming it doesn't mistakenly think you're asking for directions to the Floridian archipelago). You can also use the Find Item app in your Apple Watch to ring your fob. Asking smart home/personal assistants like Alexa or the Google Assistant to find your keys will work with Chipolo, Tile and Pebblebee trackers linked to your Android device.\nIf you have your tag but can’t find your phone, some trackers will let you ring them to find your handset. SmartTag2 fobs reliably rang our Galaxy phone when we double-pressed it. Tile trackers have the same feature. Chipolo Pop trackers can ring your phone, but uses the Chipolo app to do so, which can run concurrently with the Find My or Find Hub connection. AirTags and any third-party tags using only Apple or Google’s networks don’t offer this feature.\nThe volume of the Bluetooth tracking device may determine whether you can find an item buried in your couch cushions or in a noisy room. AirTags have a reputation for being on the quiet side, and that aligned with what we saw (measuring roughly 65 decibels). Chipolo’s Pop tags and Tile’s Pro model measure between 83 and 86 decibels on average. Pebblebee’s new Clip Universal was the loudest of any tag we’ve tested, clocking in at 91 ear-splitting decibels.\nDesign will determine what you can attach the tracker to. AirTags are small, smooth discs that can’t be secured to anything without accessories, which are numerous, but that is an additional cost to consider. Chipolo, Pebblebee and Tile offer trackers with holes that easily attach to your key ring, and all three companies also offer card-shaped versions designed to fit in your wallet. Pebblebee Clip Universal tags come with a handy carabiner-style key ring.\nBatteries are replaceable for AirTag, Tile Pro, SmartTag2 and Chipolo Pop fobs and each should go for at least a year before needing to be swapped. Tile Mate and card-shaped trackers don’t have replaceable batteries, which means you’ll have to replace the entire unit whenever it dies. Pebblebee trackers are rechargeable in both the disc and wallet variety. They’re also the only tags equipped with onboard LEDs.\nStalking, theft and data privacy\nAirTags have gotten a lot of attention and even prompted some lawsuits for Apple due to bad actors planting them on people in order to stalk them. While this fact may not influence your buying decision, any discussion of Bluetooth trackers should note what steps Apple, Google and Tile have taken to address the issue. Last year, all the major players in the Bluetooth tracker business teamed up to combat misuse and standardize how unauthorized tracking detection and alerts work for iOS and Android.\nLast year, Tile launched a feature called Anti-Theft Mode, which enables you to render one of its trackers undetectable by others. That means if someone steals your tagged item, they won’t be able to use the anti-stalking features to find and disable the tracker. That sort of negates one of the major ways potential stalking victims can stay safe, so Tile hopes ID verification and a $1 million penalty will deter misuse. Separately, Tile was hit by a data breach, raising different privacy concerns. The company issued a statement about the event, which it shared with Engadget:\n\nSimilar to many other companies, Life360 recently became the victim of a criminal extortion attempt. We received emails from an unknown actor claiming to possess Tile customer information. We promptly initiated an investigation into the potential incident and detected unauthorized access to a Tile customer support platform (but not our Tile service platform). The potentially impacted data consists of information such as names, addresses, email addresses, phone numbers, and Tile device identification numbers. It does not include more sensitive information, such as credit card numbers, passwords or log-in credentials, location data, or government-issued identification numbers, because the Tile customer support platform did not contain these information types.\n\n\nWe believe this incident was limited to the specific Tile customer support data described above and is not more widespread. We take this event and the security of customer information seriously. We have taken and will continue to take steps designed to further protect our systems from bad actors, and we have reported this event and the extortion attempt to law enforcement. We remain committed to keeping families safe online and in the real world.\n\nAs a theft deterrent, a Bluetooth tracker may or may not be the best option. Anecdotal stories abound in which people have recovered stolen goods using a tracker — but other tales are more cautionary. Neither Apple nor Google promotes its trackers or finding networks as a way to deal with theft. GPS trackers, on the other hand, are typically marketed for just that purpose.\nHow we tested Bluetooth trackers\nBefore deciding on which trackers to test, we researched the field, looking at user reviews on Amazon, Best Buy and other retailers, along with discussions on sites like Reddit. We also checked out what other publications had to say on the matter before narrowing down our options to Apple AirTag, Tile, and Chipolo trackers. When Samsung's SmartTag 2 came out in October of 2023, we added that to our testing, along with Pebblebee's rechargeable Clip tracker. After Google launched its finding network (now called Find Hub), both Chipolo and Pebblebee released trackers in 2025 that work with either network and we tested the Pop and Universal key fob models and updated our top picks accordingly.\nHere’s the full list of every tracker we tested:\n\nApple AirTag\nChipolo Card Spot\nChipolo One Spot\nChipolo One\nChipolo Card\nChipolo Pop\nPebblebe Clip Universal\nPebblebee Clip\nSamsung SmartTag 2\nChipolo One Point\nPebblebee Clip for Android\nTile Pro (2024)\nTile Mate (2024)\nTile Mate (2022)\nTile Pro (2022)\nTile Slim (2022)\n\nAfter acquiring the trackers, I tested each one over the course of a few weeks using both an iPhone 11 and a Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra. I recreated likely user experiences, such as losing and leaving items behind at home and out in the city. I planted trackers at different spots near downtown Albuquerque, mostly concentrated in and around the University of New Mexico and the surrounding neighborhood of Nob Hill. Later, I conducted tests in the Queen Anne neighborhood of Seattle. Each test was performed multiple times, both while walking and driving and I used the measure distance feature on Google Maps to track footage for alerts. I paid attention to how easy the app was to use, how reliable the phone-to-tracker connection was and any other perks and drawbacks that came up during regular use.\nAs new trackers come to market, or as we learn of worthy models to try, I'll test them and add the results to this guide. I'm currently in the process of obtaining Motorola Moto tags and look forward to seeing how they work with an Android phone. \nOther Bluetooth trackers we tested\nTile Pro and Tile Mate (2024)\nTile recently came out with a new suite of trackers, replacing the Tile Mate, Tile Pro, Tile Sticker and Tile Slim with updated models. In addition to fun new colors for the Mate and Slim, Tile added an SOS feature that can send a notification to your Life360 Circle when you triple press the button on the tracker. It’s a clever addition that turns your keys into a panic button, something offered by personal safety companies as standalone devices.\nThere are a few caveats: You and the people you want to notify in an emergency will need the Life360 app installed on your phones. If you want your Tile to also trigger a call to emergency services, you’ll need a $15-per-month Life360 subscription (that’s in addition to a Tile membership, which starts at $3/month or $30 annually). And enabling the SOS triple-press disables the ability to ring your phone with the fob.\nI tested the SOS feature and it did indeed send a text message to my Circle, with the message that I had triggered an SOS and a link to a website that showed my current location. I thought it odd that the link didn’t open the Life360 app (which shows the location of users' phones), but I wasn’t as much concerned with Tile’s personal safety features as I was with the tracking capabilities, which turned out to be less than ideal.\nFor my tests, I planted Tile trackers in a densely populated area of Seattle (about 15,000 people per square mile). After setting the trackers to “lost” in the Tile app, I waited. After four hours, one of the trackers was not discovered by the finding community, so I went and retrieved it. Another fob I planted alerted me that the tracker had been found by the Tile community after three hours — but the location it gave me was off by a third of a mile. I then decided to plant a tracker in the most populated place I could think of — the dried fruit and nuts aisle of a Trader Joes on a Friday evening before a major holiday. It still took over a half an hour before another Tile user anonymously pinged my lost tracker.\nIn my tests with Samsung’s trackers and the fobs on Google’s Find Hub network, it took around ten minutes for them to be discovered. AirTags took half that time and all were tested in a far less populated city. Four hours with no ping and over a half hour before getting a hit in a crowded TJs were pretty long stretches.\nOur top pick, the classic Chipolo, has virtually no finding network. But if you’re getting a tracker for that feature alone, you should go with AirTags if you have an iPhone or the Google-enabled Chipolo or Pebblebee trackers if you use an Android phone. We prefer the Chipolo because it works with either iOS or Android devices, it rings loud, it’s quick to tell you when you’ve left it behind and it connects nearly instantly when you’re searching for a misplaced tracker around the house.\nTile devices also work with both mobile operating systems and its latest models are indeed louder than they were before. But they aren’t as quick to connect and you need to pay for a membership to activate left-behind alerts. And when you do, those notifications don’t kick in as quickly as they do with competing trackers.\nBluetooth tracker FAQs\nWhich Bluetooth tracker has the longest range?\nBoth the Tile Pro and the Samsung Galaxy SmartTag2 claim a maximum range of around 400 feet, which is longer than the 300-foot claim for Chipolo’s Pop tags. The Pebblebee Clip Universal claims a 500-foot range, though other trackers with a shorter claimed range performed better in our tests. Apple doesn’t make range claims for AirTags. Any Bluetooth signal, of course, is dependent on a few factors. Obstacles like walls and people can block the signal, so a clear line of sight is the only way to achieve the maximum range. Other signals, like Wi-Fi, can also interfere with Bluetooth connections. Even high humidity can have an effect and lessen the distance at which your phone will connect to your tracker.\nRemember, when considering the range of Bluetooth trackers, the size of the “finding network” also comes into play. This is the number of nearby phones that can be used to anonymously ping your tracker when your own phone is out of Bluetooth range. As of now, Apple AirTags have the largest network, followed by Google’s Find Hub, Samsung’s finding community and Tile’s Life360 members.\nWhat is the best Bluetooth tracker for a car?\nBluetooth trackers are designed to track small, personal items like keys, jackets, backpacks and the like. All trackers have safeguards to prohibit the tag from being used to stalk people, so most will alert someone if a tracker that does not belong to them is detected following them. That means a car thief may get tipped off that there’s a tracker in the car they’re trying to steal. That said, you’ll see plenty of stories about people finding their car thanks to a Bluetooth tracker. Some police departments have even handed out trackers to combat high rates of carjacking. In most instances, the tracker of choice has been AirTags thanks to their wide finding network. If you’re looking for a tracker for your car, you may want to look into GPS trackers, some of which are designed for just that purpose.\nHow accurate are Bluetooth trackers?\nAccuracy for Bluetooth trackers can be looked at in two ways: Finding items nearby and finding items misplaced outside your home. For nearby items, you’ll most often use the ring function on the device to hunt it down. Two tags, Apple’s AirTags and Samsung’s Galaxy SmartTag2, also use ultra-wideband technology, which creates directional navigation on your phone to get you within a foot of the tracker.\nAccurately finding lost items outside your home depends on the size of the finding network. Since this relies on the serendipity of a random phone passing within Bluetooth range of your tracker, the more phones on a given network, the better. And since Bluetooth ranges and distance estimates are only precise within about a meter or so, getting pings from more than one phone will help locating items. Here again, it’s worth noting that Apple’s Find My network is the largest, followed by Google, Samsung and Tile (both Chipolo and Pebblebee have fobs that work with the Apple and Google networks).\nRecent Updates\nAugust 2025: Updated the name of Google's finding network to Find Hub, instead of Find My Device. Added details about Pebblebee's new Alert feature. Added a table of contents. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-bluetooth-tracker-140028377.html?src=rss",

Bluetooth trackers are small discs or cards that rely on short-range, low-energy wireless signals to communicate with your smartphone. Crowd-sourced finding capabilities are what make headlines, with stories about recovering stolen equipment or tracking lost luggage across the globe. So unless an iPhone user opts out, their phone silently acts as a location detector for any nearby AirTags. AirTags and third-party fobs using its network (such as from Chipolo or Pebblebee) include the feature by default.

    "full_text": "The Switch 2 Pro controller is the best controller Nintendo has ever made – and that’s saying something. It’s incredibly comfortable to hold, its joysticks are buttery smooth, and all of its buttons are wonderfully responsive. Nintendo even made it customizable this time with rear buttons that can easily be mapped inside of any game. The Switch 2 Pro Controller costs $85, which seems a bit egregious when you can get an excellent controller like 8BitDo’s Ultimate 2 wireless gamepad for $60. As good as the competition is, though, you won’t find anything that can be easily configured directly from within the Switch 2’s user interface. My hands often feel cramped when I play that game with the Switch 2’s Joy-Con 2 controllers for too long. But there’s none of that with the Switch 2 Pro controller. I was able to race for an hour without any discomfort, and I also noticed that it was easier for me to pull off the game’s tricky jump maneuvers and rail sliding. The Switch 2 Pro controller is also seriously helpful with fighting games, thanks to its smooth and accurate directional pad. It acquits itself to most genres easily, though it would have been nice to see analog triggers for more precise control in serious racing games."

    "summary": "Apple has fallen far behind in the competitive market of AI-powered chatbots, but it may have a plan for an in-house option that aligns with the company's \"not first, but best\" philosophy. According to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, Apple created a team called \"Answers, Knowledge and Information\" earlier this year that's tasked with developing a \"stripped-down rival to ChatGPT.\"\nForming this team represents a major change in direction from Apple's earlier stance on artificial intelligence when the company partnered with OpenAI in 2024 to infuse Siri with ChatGPT instead of developing its own AI chatbot. Now, Gurman reported that this new Apple team will instead develop in-house AI services for a \"new ChatGPT-like search experience\" that can crawl the web to respond to questions. These new capabilities could be a standalone app, as well as support AI capabilities for Apple's Siri, Spotlight and Safari, according to Gurman's sources. The team is reportedly led by Robby Walker, who previously oversaw Siri, and has been advertising job openings that mention wanting experience with search algorithms and engine development.\nBeyond the Answers, Knowledge and Information team, Apple has experienced some growing pains when it comes to artificial intelligence. Earlier this year, the company said it would delay the release of the new-and-improved Siri, adding only that it would roll out \"in the coming year.\" However, Apple is aware of the need to accelerate its Apple Intelligence program to stay competitive. In the latest third-quarter earnings call, the company's CEO Tim Cook said that Apple is open to acquisitions to fast-track its AI roadmap.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/apple-reportedly-has-a-stripped-down-ai-chatbot-to-compete-with-chatgpt-in-the-works-164345473.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Amazon is selling the DJI Mini 4K drone for just $249, which is a discount of $50. The deal is only for Prime members. This is the lowest price we've seen for this particular model since early in the year.\nThe Mini 4K is a beginner-friendly drone, but it's still got plenty of nifty features. As the name suggests, it can capture 4K video at up to 30 FPS. It can also record 2.7K footage at 60 FPS. There's 2x digital zoom, a 3-axis gimbal and electrical image stabilization. The drone can transmit 1080p video from up to 10km away. \n \nIt offers level-5 wind resistance, which is nice, and can fly for up to 31 minutes per charge. The drone allows for one-tap movements and comes with a dedicated remote. Users can also access the companion app for additional controls and to access flight tutorials.\nPerhaps the coolest feature here is the size and form factor. The Mini 4K is small enough that it doesn't require FAA registration, so you can take it out immediately after unboxing. It's also foldable, making it easy to store when not in use. This particular model didn't make our list of the best drones, but its more expensive sibling, the Mini 4 Pro, was our very favorite.\nFollow @EngadgetDeals on X for the latest tech deals and buying advice.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/prime-members-can-get-the-dji-mini-4k-drone-on-sale-for-249-150201768.html?src=rss",

It features \"combat, traversal and puzzle solving in a lore rich post apocalyptic world.\" The teaser doesn't give us much information beyond that and there's no release date just yet, but we do know it'll be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S and PC.\nIf you missed the showcase, you can catch up here on everything that was announced (like that new Spongebob game). And according to THQ Nordic, that's only half of what it has up its sleeve. At the end of the showcase, the publisher said a total of 28 games are currently in development, with 15 we still have yet to see.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/darksiders-4-was-not-on-my-2025-bingo-card-204611075.html?src=rss",
