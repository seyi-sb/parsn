The Financial Times reports that Altman and OpenAI are backing a new company called Merge Labs developing brain implants, making it a pretty direct rival to Musk’s Neuralink. This has clearly been an interest of Altman’s for a while though — he wrote about “the merge” between humans and machines on his personal blog back in 2017, and connects it pretty directly to his work at OpenAI: The merge can take a lot of forms: We could plug electrodes into our brains, or we could all just become really close friends with a chatbot.

    "full_text": "While other providers tend to reserve perks like streaming services for higher-tier plans, Verizon’s Unlimited Welcome lets you add them individually to suit your needs -- typically for $10 a month each, depending on the service. By itself, the plan offers no way to wirelessly share your cellular connection from your phone, but for an additional $10 you can add 100GB of data. Each person on an account can pick a different plan that suits them (unlike T-Mobile and AT&T, which require everyone to share the same plan at this comparative entry level). From a perks perspective, for example, that means one person who travels frequently could add the 3 TravelPass Days option ($10) to their line. Some perks, such as Apple Music Family, are added to the cost of one line and the benefit is shared by up to five family members. (Each perk has its own restrictions, so be sure to read the details carefully.) However, the Unlimited Welcome plan isn't as welcome when it comes to 5G data speeds: It can only tap into regular low-band 5G. We also like that each person on a Verizon account can have their own plan with different perks. Families who want to keep costs low but still have options for some perks. Anyone who wants to connect at higher 5G speeds and take advantage of the capabilities they paid for when buying a phone."

    "summary": "I’m a longtime lover of pen and paper, so E Ink tablets have been intriguing to me ever since they started becoming more widely available. After having hundreds of half-filled notebooks over the years, I, at some point, turned to digital tools instead because it was just easier to store everything on my phone or laptop so I always had my most important information at my fingertips.E-Ink tablets seem to provide the best of both worlds: the tactile satisfaction of regular notebooks with many of the conveniences found in digital tools, plus easy-on-the-eyes E-Ink screens. These devices have come a long way in recent years — now you can find them in multiple sizes, some have color E Ink screens and others double as full-blow ereaders with access to ebook stores and your local library’s offerings. I’ve tested out close to a dozen E Ink tablets over the past few years to see how well they work, how convenient they really are and which are the best tablets using E Ink screens available today.\nTable of contents\n\nBest E Ink tablets for 2025\nAre E Ink tablets worth it?\nWhat to look for in an E Ink tablet\nOther E Ink tablets we've tested\n\nBest E Ink tablets for 2025\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAre E Ink tablets worth it?\nAn E Ink tablet will be a worthwhile purchase to a very select group of people. If you prefer the look and feel of an e paper display to LCD panels found on traditional tablets, it makes a lot of sense. They’re also good options for those who want a more paper-like writing experience (although you can get that kind of functionality on a regular tablet with the right screen protector) or a more distraction-free device overall. \nThe final note is key here. Many E Ink tablets don’t run on the same operating systems as regular tablets, so you’re automatically going to be limited in what you can do. And even with those that do allow you to download traditional apps like Chrome, Instagram and Facebook, E Ink tablets are not designed to give you the best casual-browsing experience. This is mostly due to the nature of E Ink displays, which have noticeable refreshes, a lack of vibrant colors and lower picture quality than the panels you’ll find on even the cheapest iPad.\nArguably the biggest reason why you wouldn’t want to go with an iPad (all models of which support stylus input, a plethora of reading apps, etc) is because it’s much easier to get distracted by email, social media and other Internet-related temptations.\nWhat to look for in an E Ink tablet\nWriting and latency\nArguably the most important thing to consider when looking for an E Ink tablet is the writing experience. How good it is will depend a lot on the display’s refresh rate (does it refresh after every time you put pen to “paper,” or at a different regular interval) and the stylus’ latency. Most of the tablets I’ve tested have little to no latency, but some are certainly better than others. Finally, you should double check before buying that your preferred E Ink tablet comes with a stylus, or if you need to purchase one separately.\nReading\nHow much will you be reading books, documents and other things on this tablet? E Ink tablets come in many sizes, but most of them tend to be larger than your standard e-reader because it makes writing much easier. Having a larger display isn’t a bad thing, but it might make holding it for long periods slightly more uncomfortable. (Most e-readers are roughly the size of a paperback book, giving you a similar feeling to analog reading).\nThe supported file types for e-books can also make a big difference. It’s hard to make a blanket statement here because this varies so much among E Ink tablets. The TL;DR is that you’ll have a much better reading experience if you go with one made by a company that already has a history in e-book sales (i.e. Amazon or Kobo). All of the titles you bought via the Kindle or Kobo store should automatically be available to you on your Kindle or Kobo E Ink tablet.\nAlso with Kindle titles, specifically, since they are protected by DRM, it’s not necessarily the best idea to try to bring those titles over to a third-party device. Unless the tablet runs an operating system like Android that supports downloads for apps like Kindle and Kobo, you’ll be limited to supported file types, like ePUB, PDF, MOBI, JPEG, PNG and others.\nSearch functionality\nMost E Ink tablets have some on-device search features, but they can vary widely between models. You’ll want to consider how important it is to you to be able to search through all your handwritten notes and markups. I noticed in my testing that Amazon’s and Kobo’s E Ink tablets made it easy to refer back to notes made in books and files because they automatically save to the specific pages on which you took notes, made highlights and more.\nSearching is less standardized on E Ink tablets that have different supported file types, but their features can be quite powerful in their own right. For example, a few devices I tested supported text search in handwritten notes along with handwriting recognition, the latter of which allows you to translate your scribbles into typed text.\nSharing and connectivity\nWhile we established that E Ink tablets can be great distraction-free devices, most manufacturers understand that your notes and doodles aren’t created in a vacuum. You may want to access them elsewhere, and that requires some form of connectivity. All of the E Ink tablets I tried have Wi-Fi support, and some support cloud syncing, companion mobile apps and the ability to export notes via email so you can access them elsewhere.\nNone of them, however, integrate directly with a digital note taking system like Evernote or OneNote, so these devices will always be somewhat supplementary if you use apps like that, too. I’d argue that, if you already lean heavily on apps like OneNote, a standard tablet with a stylus and screen protector might be the best way to go. Ultimately, you should think about what you will want to do with the documents you’ll interact with on your E Ink tablet after the tablet portion is done.\nPrice\nE Ink tablets aren’t known for being cheap. They generally fall into the $300-$800 price range, which is what you can expect to pay for a solid regular tablet, too. A key factor in price is size: cheaper devices with E Ink displays are likely to have smaller screens, and stylus support isn’t as much of a given. Also, those types of devices are generally considered e-readers because of their size and may not be the best for note-taking, doodling and the like.\nE Ink tablets have gone up in price recently. Supernote and Onyx Boox increased prices, as did reMarkable. The former said it was due to \"increased costs,” and a reMarkable representative confirmed this to Engadget and provided the following statement: \"We regularly review our pricing based on market conditions and operational costs. We've communicated an upcoming adjustment for the US market effective in May to provide transparency to our customers. Multiple factors influence our pricing decisions, including supply chain dynamics and overall operational costs in specific markets.”\nAs a result, the reMarkable Paper Pro jumped from $579 to $629 (that's for the bundle with the standard Marker and no Folio). This isn't great, considering the Paper Pro was already on the expensive side of the spectrum for E Ink tablets. It's also worth noting that Supernote and Onyx Boox have raised prices in the past few months as well.\nOther E Ink tablets we've tested\nLenovo Smart Paper\nLenovo made a solid E Ink tablet in the Smart Paper, but it's too pricey and too married to the company's companion cloud service to warrant a spot on our top picks list. The hardware is great, but the software isn't as flexible as those of competitors like the reMarkable 2. It has good Google Drive integration, but you must pair it with Lenovo's cloud service to really get the most use out of it — and in the UK, the service costs £9 per month for three months, which is quite expensive.\nOnyx Boox Tab Ultra\nThe Boox Tab Ultra has a lot of the same features we like in the Note Air 2 Plus, but it’s designed to be a true, all-purpose tablet with an E Ink screen. Running Android 11 and compatible with a magnetic keyboard case, you can use it like a standard 2-in-1 laptop, albeit a low-powered one. You can browse the web, check email and even watch YouTube videos on this thing — but that doesn’t mean you should. A standard 2-in-1 laptop with a more responsive screen and better overall performance would be a better fit for most people who even have the slightest desire to have an all-in-one device. Like the rest of Onyx’s devices, the Tab Ultra is specifically for those who put reading and eye comfort above all else.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/best-e-ink-tablet-130037939.html?src=rss",

Rather, it provides the best mix of features people will find useful in an e-paper device like this. Hats off to reMarkable for making an E Ink tablet that feels right at home with all of your other fancy gadgets. I observed basically no lag between my pressing down onto the reMarkable 2’s screen and lines showing up. As mentioned, there’s little to no latency when writing on the Scribe with its companion pen. I noticed a barely perceptible latency and good pressure sensitivity, which is most obvious using the fountain pen. The tap-to-convert feature almost always correctly turned my weird printing-and-cursive-hybrid handwriting into type, and uploading notebooks to Dropbox or Google Drive took mere seconds. Most of the tablets I’ve tested have little to no latency, but some are certainly better than others. E Ink tablets come in many sizes, but most of them tend to be larger than your standard e-reader because it makes writing much easier.

It also comes with the chain's famous french fries and your choice of drink. It was an acceptable flavor that I drank about half of. There was a vague fruit flavor that I couldn't exactly nail down. I sampled the hot pink whipped cream by itself, and it seemed to have no flavor, so maybe they just took regular whipped cream and dyed it pink. Inside the tin is a card with a code you can scan to explore McDonaldland online, an ID card for your particular character, two postcards and four stickers. Honestly, unless McDonald's nostalgia is your thing, I'd recommend you just stick to ordering your usual at the Golden Arches and skipping the meal."

    "summary": "The best soundbars can completely transform your TV setup, turning flat, lifeless audio into something that actually sounds cinematic. Whether you're watching blockbuster movies, listening to music or gaming, a good soundbar delivers clearer vocals, deep bass and better overall playback than most built-in TV speakers ever could.In 2025, there’s a soundbar for every kind of home entertainment setup — from compact all-in-one units to full surround systems with subwoofers and rear speakers. Some prioritize simplicity and sleek design, while others are packed with immersive features like Dolby Atmos and smart voice controls. No matter your budget or your space, we’ve picked the best soundbars you can buy right now to help elevate your audio experience.\nTable of contents\n\nThe post-CES soundbar outlook for 2025\nBest soundbars for 2025\nWhat to look for in a soundbar \nOther soundbars we tested\nBest soundbar FAQs\n\nThe post-CES soundbar outlook for 2025\nI typically come out of CES with a pretty clear understanding of the new soundbars that are coming for the year, but that wasn’t exactly the case in 2025. LG decided to carry over its most premium soundbars from 2024, but it will add the compact S20A this year. The company only previewed the model at CES, so full specs are still forthcoming. \nSamsung will once again keep the same overall design and features for its top-end Q990 soundbar. However, the company is adding a few new tools and it drastically reduced the size of the wireless subwoofer that comes in the box. Samsung does have one new model for 2025, the QS700F, that’s designed to sit on a table or automatically adjust to being mounted flat on a wall. Details are scarce on that soundbar for now and I anticipate a full spec sheet when the company is really to sell it.\nOf the big three TV companies, Sony is the only one that didn’t announce any home theater gear at CES. The company has decided to focus mainly on its automotive efforts at the show recently, leaving TV and audio announcements for later in the year. The company debuted multiple soundbar options in 2024 and a four-speaker setup for the living room in the Bravia Quad. That said, it wouldn’t surprise me if Sony released new soundbars later in the year since its most recent models were only announced last April.\nOne company I would keep an eye on is Sennheiser. The original Ambeo model is nearly six years old and could use a refresh. The company has added medium and mini options to the Ambeo lineup since then, but it would be nice to see a refined version of the largest model too. The original Ambeo soundbar is huge, so no matter how good it sounds, it will always be a tough sell for some people.\nAlthough I think it’s less likely, it’s also possible that Sonos has new soundbars this year. While the company’s next device will likely be the rumored set-top streaming box, the Sound Motion tech inside the Arc Ultra would offer a big improvement to bass performance in compact models like the Beam and Ray. The company may bring Sound Motion to standalone speakers first, but it’s destined for those smaller soundbars eventually.\nThe best soundbars for 2025\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nWhat to look for in a soundbar\nFeatures\nWhen it comes to features, the more you pay the more you're going to get in your new audio system. Most affordable options ($150 or less) will improve your television's audio quality, but that's about it. Step into the $300 to $400 range and you'll find all-in-one soundbars with things like built-in voice control, wireless connectivity, Google Chromecast, AirPlay 2 and even Android TV. They're all helpful when you want to avoid looking for the remote control, but the best playback quality is usually only in the top tier and the formats those premium soundbar systems support. I’m talking about things like Dolby Atmos, DTS:X and other high-resolution audio standards — essentials if you’re building a truly cinematic home entertainment setup. And not all Atmos soundbars are equal, so you'll need to look at the finer details carefully before you break into the savings account. If you're looking for one of the best Dolby Atmos soundbars, size, channels and subwoofer options will be important factors to consider. Some models even include a dedicated subwoofer to enhance bass performance, bringing an extra punch to action scenes and soundtracks.\nPorts\n\n\n\n\nThis is a big one. A lot of the more affordable soundbars are limited when it comes to connectivity options. They either offer an optical port or one HDMI jack and, if you're lucky, both. Things get slightly better in the mid-range section, but that's not always the case. The Sonos Beam, for example, is $449, but only has a single HDMI port. Even at the higher-end, the $899 Sonos Arc still only has one HDMI port. If you plan to connect multiple devices like a set-top box, gaming laptop or console directly to your soundbar for the best audio experience, you’ll want an option with at least two HDMI (eARC) inputs. HDMI connections are critical for supporting Dolby Atmos and Dolby Digital audio formats, as well as high-res passthrough for HDR and 8K/4K content.\nChannels\nAnother big thing you’ll want to pay attention to when looking for the best soundbar is channels. That’s the 2.1, 7.1.2 or other decimal number that companies include in product descriptions. The first figure corresponds to the number of channels. A two would just be left and right while a more robust Atmos system, especially one with rear surround speakers, could be five or seven (left, right, center and upward). The second number refers to the dedicated subwoofer, so if your new soundbar comes with one or has them built in, you’ll see one here. The third numeral is up-firing speakers, important for the immersive effect of Dolby Atmos. Not all Atmos-enabled units have them, but if they do, the third number will tell you how many are in play and how they contribute to the overall soundstage.\nWireless\n\n\n\n\nMost soundbars these days offer either Bluetooth, Wi-Fi or both. When it comes to Wi-Fi, that connectivity affords you luxuries like voice control (either built-in or with a separate device), Chromecast, Spotify Connect and AirPlay 2. Depending on your preferences, you might be able to live without some of these. For me, AirPlay 2 and Chromecast are essentials, but the rest I can live without. Those two give me the ability to beam music and podcasts from my go-to apps without having to settle for — or struggle with — a Bluetooth connection. For instance, Sonos speakers often offer seamless integration with iOS devices, making it easy to connect and stream music wirelessly. If you’re looking for a wireless speaker that can enhance your TV setup while also offering flexibility for audio throughout the house, it's worth considering a multi-room system.\nSize\nThis one might seem obvious but humor me for a minute. Nothing is more soul-crushing than getting a pricey soundbar in your living room only to discover you have to rearrange everything to find a spot for it. This was my plight when the Sennheiser Ambeo Soundbar arrived at my door. Yes, that speaker is absurdly large (and heavy), and most soundbars aren't nearly as big. I learned a valuable lesson: Make sure the space where you want to put a soundbar will accommodate the thing you're about to spend hundreds (if not thousands) of dollars on.\nBasically, it all comes down to the TV you have (or are planning to get) and what the primary goal is for your living-room audio. Is it ease of use? Do you want the best possible sound from a single speaker or speaker/sub combo? Do you just want to be able to actually hear your TV better? Or do you want a full home entertainment experience with crisp vocals, thunderous deep bass, and immersive surround system audio?\nBy paying attention to each of those areas, you should have a good idea of what to look for in a soundbar, soundbar/subwoofer combo, Dolby Digital system or a more robust setup. With that said, we've put numerous products through their paces at Engadget and have a few favorites for best soundbar at various price points to get you started.\nOther soundbars we tested\nSony Bravia Theater Bar 6\nThere’s a lot to like about the Bravia Theater Bar 6, Sony’s new midrange option in its soundbar lineup. Sound quality is the speaker’s best attribute, even though it’s limited by its 3.1.2-channel configuration. The biggest two issues with this model are the lack of Wi-Fi connectivity — which means no AirPlay, Chromecast or Spotify Connect — and the need to use your computer and a thumb drive to install firmware updates. Neither of those should be things you have to consider on a $650 soundbar in 2025.\nSonos Arc\nThere’s no doubt that the Arc is Sonos’ best-sounding soundbar, but it’s also the company’s most expensive. With a new model based on the Arc rumored to be on the way, it’s difficult to recommend this product over the likes of Samsung and Sony. The Arc works well as both a soundbar and a speaker, and the device will fit in nicely with other Sonos gear you might already have for a multiroom setup. It only has one HDMI port though, where much of the competition allows you to connect streaming and gaming devices directly to their soundbars.\nSennheiser Ambeo Soundbar Plus\nI don’t think Sennheiser’s medium-sized model offers enough to stand out from the more powerful Ambeo Soundbar Max or the Ambeo Soundbar Mini. The Mini is more affordable and does a solid job with immersive audio in its own right. Like the rest of the Ambeo lineup, there’s no option for satellite speakers as you can only add a subwoofer to the soundbars. However, the Ambeo Soundbar Plus does have RCA input, so you can use it with a turntable if you’re into vinyl.\nBest soundbar FAQs\nIs a soundbar better than speakers?\nIt really depends on what you’re after. A soundbar is definitely a simpler, more compact solution compared to a full speaker setup. If you want better sound than your TV’s built-in setup but don’t want to deal with multiple speakers and wires everywhere, a soundbar is probably the way to go. Some soundbars can even deliver impressive surround sound effects, thanks to features like Dolby Atmos and virtual audio technology. \nHowever, if you’re an audiophile or want true surround sound for an at-home theater experience, a multi-speaker setup with a receiver, surround speakers and subwoofer will give you a richer soundstage and more control over your experience.\nWhat connection do I need for a soundbar?\nMost modern soundbars connect to your TV via HDMI ARC or eARC, which is the easiest and best option for achieving high-quality audio. If your TV supports this, all you need is an HDMI cable, and you’ll get not only great sound but also some extra features like controlling the soundbar with your TV remote. \nIf HDMI ARC isn’t an option on your TV, you can use an optical cable, which also delivers solid audio quality. Some soundbars even offer Bluetooth or Wi-Fi connections for streaming music, and a few still have a 3.5mm aux jack for connecting to older devices. \nDo all soundbars come with subwoofers?\nNot all soundbars come with subwoofers, but many do or at least offer one as an optional add-on that you can purchase separately. A subwoofer is what gives you that deep, booming bass, so if you like action movies or want a fuller sound for music, having one can make a big difference. Some soundbars have a built-in subwoofer, but these generally don’t provide the same punch as a separate one. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/speakers/best-soundbars-143041791.html?src=rss",
    "full_text": "In 2025, there’s a soundbar for every kind of home entertainment setup — from compact all-in-one units to full surround systems with subwoofers and rear speakers. LG decided to carry over its most premium soundbars from 2024, but it will add the compact S20A this year. Details are scarce on that soundbar for now and I anticipate a full spec sheet when the company is really to sell it. That said, it wouldn’t surprise me if Sony released new soundbars later in the year since its most recent models were only announced last April. The company may bring Sound Motion to standalone speakers first, but it’s destined for those smaller soundbars eventually. The expanded speech enhancement feature comes with a degree of customization and there are now two options for room calibration. However, you’ll still get a virtualized 7.1.4-channel speaker setup that works well for movies and music. Some soundbars can even deliver impressive surround sound effects, thanks to features like Dolby Atmos and virtual audio technology. Most modern soundbars connect to your TV via HDMI ARC or eARC, which is the easiest and best option for achieving high-quality audio.

That's because the Pixel 10 is rumored to fully support Qi2 wireless charging, which supports magnetic alignment and has magnets built into the phone without needing a case. Following last year's Tensor G4 chip in the Pixel 9 lineup, we presume that the Pixel 10 phones will be powered by a (supposedly named) Tensor G5 chip. We've heard a few Tensor G5 rumors, including that it will be made on an industry-standard 3nm process by chip fabricator TSMC, according to an Android Authority March report. Other rumors are less promising, like a July report from WCCFTech suggesting that while the Tensor G5 is a significant upgrade on last year's Tensor G4, a leaked benchmark test claims it will run slower than the Snapdragon 8 Elite processor that's used in Samsung's Galaxy S25 line and the OnePlus 13. Whether the Tensor G5 lags behind other mobile chips isn't as worrying as it might seem, since the Tensor chips are built for Google's Pixel devices -- and those don't seem to be underperforming in daily use. There aren't many rumors pointing toward another Pixel Fold, but it's always possible that Google surprises us with a big reveal of another version of its foldable phone line. One Pixel 10 Pro Fold rumor from WCCFTech only shared details about the supposed Tensor chip powering it. The Pixel 10 Pro Fold would presumably get Android 16 out of the box, but since that software upgrade has already been released early (mere weeks after Google I/O 2025), last year's Pixel 9 Pro Fold already has that update anyway."

In a series of X posts on Monday night, Musk suggested that Apple was “playing politics” by not placing either X or xAI’s Grok chatbot in the App Store’s list of recommended iOS apps, and that he had no choice but to file a lawsuit. “Apple is behaving in a manner that makes it impossible for any AI company besides OpenAI to reach #1 in the App Store, which is an unequivocal antitrust violation,” Musk said. “Why do you refuse to put either X or Grok in your ‘Must Have’ section when X is the #1 news app in the world and Grok is #5 among all apps?,” the xAI CEO asked Apple in another post, which is now pinned to his profile. China’s DeepSeek AI briefly managed to take the top App Store position from ChatGPT in January, however, disproving Musk’s claim that it would be impossible for other AI apps to do so. Accusations of meddling from Musk are ironic, given allegations about alterations made to X after he acquired the company in 2022, then known as Twitter. This isn’t the first time that Musk has beefed with Apple and OpenAI. Musk was an early founder at OpenAI, and previously targeted the AI startup via lawsuits and a unanimously rejected $97.4 billion buyout offer after taking issue with its pivot to being a profit-driven business. Following OpenAI’s partnership with Apple to integrate ChatGPT into iPhones, iPads, and Macs last year, Musk threatened to ban Apple devices at his companies if OpenAI’s tech was fused with Apple’s OS.

The 30-second teaser includes a few shadowy glimpses of the new device, a peek at the unfolded inner display, and a solid look at the back of the foldable and its camera system. The teaser also shows that the phone will come in the nice gray color that Google has already shown in a similar video for a Pixel 10. Google’s Pixel 10 Pro Fold video doesn’t include any specs, unfortunately, though the phone is rumored to have an IP68 rating that would make it dustproof. Leaks have also shown the phone in green and gold colors that aren’t in this video. And while the video’s description includes the August 20th Pixel 10 event date, the video doesn’t say when the phone might actually be released — and a report from WinFuture indicates that may not happen until October.

The Life of a Showgirl's release date, track list and cover art have yet to be revealed. Swift is slated to appear on the New Heights podcast, which is hosted by her boyfriend and Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce and his brother Jason Kelce.

    "full_text": "Some models of Apple's popular AirPods may soon be able to perform live, in-person language translations when you squeeze both stems at the same time. According to an image posted by websites including 9to5Mac, the touch gesture is featured in a system asset that's part of Apple iOS 26 developer beta 6. In June, Apple showed off AI-powered live translation features it plans to roll out for apps including Messages, FaceTime and Phone. According to 9to5Mac, the feature is likely to work with the AirPods Pro 2 and AirPods fourth-gen models. It's unclear if live translations would be available across Apple devices or if it would be exclusive to new product models, such as the company's upcoming iPhone 17 lineup. Apple didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. One scenario, if Apple chooses to make live translation features available sooner rather than later, would be to make it a marquee Apple Intelligence feature of iPhone 17, which is expected to debut in September. The selling point might be Apple touting iPhone 17 as its first Apple device with the AI features and hardware capable of such a magical feat. However, that might also open the company up to criticism: Samsung phones have had the ability to live-translate phone calls since 2024's Galaxy S24. Meta's Ray-Bans smart glasses also have live translation features, as have some other gadgets, such as Pixel Buds dating back to 2017."

Luckily I'm the product development design engineer who oversees operations at CNET's testing lab, and after the Dreame X50 robot vacuum was named CNET's best for obstacles and pets, I got to see how it performed in real-world conditions at my place. It started with a full deep clean, then vacuumed and mopped on its second run. I found it to be pretty smart about lifting its mops while vacuuming the carpet. The Dreame X50 also did a great job at identifying cords, and it knew to avoid them. This is a massive advantage over competitors, which often struggle with pet hair. It can be removed easily if you ever need to clear anything that might get caught between the dual rollers. At its full price of around $1,700, the Dreame X50 Ultra is a very expensive robot vacuum. It's a neat way to check on your house when you're not home."

Now, Starlink is reducing the cost of its internet plans even further. The Residential plan, which has advertised speeds between 150 and 250Mbps, is down to $99 per month from its original price tag of $120. But there’s a big asterisk with all of those deals: They only apply in areas where Starlink has an excess of bandwidth. At my address in Seattle, you’d actually have to pay an extra fee of $1,000 because there’s such high demand in the city. In general these exclude major cities where Starlink is likely experiencing strain on its network caused by too many users. One analysis published last month by Penn State University found that Starlink's satellites can handle just 6.66 households per square mile before service starts to dip below the minimum broadband speeds set by the Federal Communication Commission. According to CNET's sister publication PCMag, the discount only lasts for one year. After that, you’ll automatically be switched to the regular price. At the same time as it’s discounting its monthly plans, Starlink is also cutting the cost of its satellite dish in half from $349 to $175."

    "summary": "Officials are reportedly blaming a recent breach of the U.S. federal court's filing system on Russia, whose hackers used the access to snoop on midlevel criminal cases in the New York City area and other jurisdictions.",
    "full_text": "Citing anonymous sources, the newspaper said Russia “is at least in part responsible” for the cyberattack, without saying what part of the Russian government is behind the hack. The hackers searched for “midlevel criminal cases in the New York City area and several other jurisdictions, with some cases involving people with Russian and Eastern European surnames,” per the article. Last week, Politico reported that hackers had broken into the federal judiciary’s electronic case filing system, potentially accessing the identities of confidential informants, which are redacted and not publicly known, putting those people at risk of retaliation from the criminals they are helping authorities apprehend. Politico reported that the stolen data could include sealed criminal dockets and indictments, arrest warrants, and other documents not yet public, or may never actually be included in public dockets. The Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts, the agency that oversees the U.S. federal court system, confirmed a cyberattack in a statement on August 7. The New York Times also quoted a memo sent to Justice Department officials, clerks, and chief judges by the court system’s administrators, which said that “persistent and sophisticated cyber threat actors have recently compromised sealed records.” The email said “this remains an URGENT MATTER that requires immediate action.” This may not be Russia’s first rodeo targeting the U.S. federal court system. In 2020, a long-running Russian cyberattack targeted the SolarWinds software, used by large tech companies and government agencies, to deliver a tainted software update allowing Russian government hackers backdoor access to the networks of SolarWinds customers. The widespread hack affected several U.S. government departments, including PACER, allowing the theft of sealed court documents. The U.S. Courts, in its statement on August 7, said that the agency was “enhancing security of the system and to block future attacks, and it is prioritizing working with courts to mitigate the impact on litigants.”"

    "full_text": "is a news editor covering technology, gaming, and more. He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme. Riot Games is going to slowly introduce a WASD-based control scheme to League of Legends, which previously relied on point and click controls. “We believe that offering WASD controls will provide a fresh yet familiar way to play for both new players and veterans of the Rift without changing what makes League, League,” Riot says. The company notes that WASD is “the most familiar control scheme for PC games today,” and by adding it as a control option, “we believe League will feel more intuitive to some players who come from other games.” However, Riot is also working to “ensure competitive balance” between the two different control styles, so it’s going to start with a test of the control scheme on League’s public beta environment before slowly rolling it out to non-ranked and eventually ranked and pro play. League of Legends launched nearly 16 years ago, and while it’s a hugely popular game, it has a reputation for being pretty intimidating to get into. Despite having watched many hours of competitive League, whenever I’ve tried to play it myself, I’ve quickly bounced because of its complexity. WASD controls could lower the barrier to entry, and Riot says that they are “the first of a number of long-term projects we’re working on to help shape League’s future.”"

Both models come with 30,000 pascals of suction, which should translate into strong pickup performance on hard flooring and carpet. You also get a rolling mop brush roller that constantly cleans itself with fresh water in real time. The vacuum also self-cleans in its docking station with temperatures up to 212 degrees Fahrenheit. Rather than lifting up the mopping pads like many robots, it covers the mop with a rubber guard when carpets are detected, presumably saving you from errant drips and accidental contact with more plush carpets. Like all the other models, it comes with a self-cleaning and self-emptying base station. It comes with 13,000 pascales of suction, but it still has higher-end features like being able to detect flooring types and automatically boost suction for carpet (a vital feature if you have three cats). The base station supports auto-emptying like other models and has a 3.2-liter dust bag capacity lasting 100 days."

The Duo Cam Pan acts as one device with two 2K resolution cameras. Multiple smart devices can be connected to the same Wyze security system. The two-camera system features one unmoving camera that maintains a feed of the most important area, while a second camera swivels and tracks motion in its operating zone. The moving camera has a 360-degree horizontal and 180-degree vertical range. The Duo Cam Pan comes equipped with color night vision capabilities, IP65-rated weather resistance, two-way audio and motion-activated spotlights that can be configured with voice prompts for extra security. The device costs $70, but if you want to install multiple cameras in different locations, the two-pack is $130. While the Wyze Duo Cam Pan is designed for both indoor and outdoor environments, you won't be able to use this camera system outside until September, when the Wyze Cam Universal Outdoor Power Adapter comes out."

Krafton has fired another shot in its legal battle with former executives of Subnautica 2 studio Unknown Worlds, who filed a lawsuit last month, claiming the South Korean publisher undermined the game’s release to avoid paying them a bonus. In its response, Krafton claims that the three plaintiffs, Ted Gill, Charlie Cleveland, and Max McGuire, had “lost interest in developing Subnautica 2.” The story told by Krafton’s lawyers in the filing is that after selling Unknown Worlds to Krafton for $500 million and promising $250 million more in earnout bonuses, Cleveland and McGuire essentially checked out of working on Subnautica 2 to focus on personal projects. “In 2024 and 2025, Cleveland stated that he was ‘no longer working on games but […] working on a couple of films,’” while “McGuire started ‘working on initiatives that fall outside of [the Company’s] main development activities.’” As for Gill, “And Gill, who remained, focused on leveraging his operational control to maximize the earnout payment, rather than developing a successful game.” They allege that without the leadership of Cleveland and McGuire, development on Subnautica 2 suffered to the point that a delay of the game’s early access launch was necessary. …as the end of the carnout period drew nearer, the game was still nowhere near its planned scope. Indeed, as late as March of 2025, only two months before the Key Employees claimed the game was ready for the first Early Access (“EA”) release, the development lead for Subnautica 2 at Unknown Worlds noted that the first EA and second EA (planned for December 2025) would only be “about 12% of our intended 1.0 scope” and joked that “at that rate we would be in development for 30 years.”"

Preloading the Battlefield 6 beta started on Aug. 4. Doing a preload means you'll be able to jump on the beta as soon as it's available instead of waiting for it to download on the day of access. Here are the BF6 Beta download links for each platform: : An urban battlefield in the heart of Egypt. Just like with the maps, each weekend will also feature certain game modes. A special note if you haven't played a Battlefield game on PC recently: Studio DICE and EA recently started requiring players to set their computers to Secure Boot when playing Battlefield games to combat cheaters, and Battlefield 6 is no different."

They’re here to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge. Paytm is currently the third most-used UPI payments platform, behind Walmart-owned PhonePe and Google Pay. Paytm reported (PDF) net income of ₹1.23 billion (approximately $14 million) for the first quarter of its financial year 2026, ending in June — a turnaround from a loss during the same period last year. The results beat expectations, as analysts had projected a loss of ₹1.27 billion (approximately $14.5 million). In addition to its recent financial growth, Paytm’s shares have risen 13.25% year-to-date in 2025, signaling that the company is beginning to regain market confidence after more than a year of regulatory setbacks."

Now, after six years, the company — which operates popular dating apps Match, Tinder, OkCupid, Hinge, and Plenty of Fish — has agreed to a $14 million settlement, as announced by the FTC on Tuesday. The FTC stated that the $14 million will be used to provide “redress to injured consumers.” According to the lawsuit, consumers were at risk of being scammed after the company sent marketing emails regarding new messages from senders it had already identified as likely bots or scammers, subsequently deceiving them into purchasing subscriptions while knowingly profiting from it. Additionally, Match Group was accused of locking users out of their accounts after they attempted to dispute charges and kept their money without delivering the services they had paid for. The company was also accused of making it difficult for users to cancel their subscriptions. Along with the $14 million settlement, the proposed order requires Match Group to take several actions to address the issues. For instance, the company needs to clearly spell out the details of the six-month guarantee and ensure it doesn’t take adverse actions against customers who raise billing issues. It also has to provide easy ways for users to cancel their subscriptions. The settlement comes as the company continues to face criticism over how it handles trust and safety issues."

The Dexcom G6 reads your blood sugar every 5 minutes, keeping track of your blood sugar level as long as you're wearing it night and day. You can set a custom range for where you'd like your blood sugar to be, and if it goes into low blood sugar or high blood sugar ranges you set, you will get notified. \"For patients on an insulin pump, the Dexcom G6 may connect with your pump and offer a closed-loop system to turn off your insulin if you are going low. The Dexcom monitor is also approved in pregnancy and offers continuous monitoring that you can see on your phone at all times,\" said Dr. Rebecca Fenichel, an endocrinologist at Westmed Medical Group."

    "summary": "Previously, if you wanted a monitor for competitive gaming, you had to choose between an IPS or VA panel to get something with a super high refresh rate or opt for a slower OLED display with richer colors and better contrast. But today, Samsung is changing that with the Odyssey OLED G6, which is the first 500Hz OLED gaming monitor in the world.\nAvailable for $1,000, the Odyssey OLED G6 (G60SF) only comes in one size (27 inches) and features a QHD resolution (2,560 x 1440) with a 16:9 aspect ratio and critically, that blisteringly speedy 500Hz refresh rate with a .03ms (GTG) response time. Its QD-OLED panel also has a matte anti-reflective coating and support for both AMD FreeSync Premium Pro and NVIDIA G-Sync. And after seeing it in person, it really is a very pretty monitor, as it boasts vibrant colors and deep inky blacks while still being able to satisfy even the most demanding competitive gamers.\nSam Rutherford for Engadget\nThat said, the Odyssey OLED G6 is a rather straightforward product. It doesn't come with any of Samsung's built-in smart features like an included remote or the company's Gaming Hub. And with a typical brightness of just 300 nits, while you do get VESA DisplayHDR TrueBlack 500 certification, it's not the best monitor to put in a sunny room.\nBut that's not exactly a deal-breaker, because from what I've seen, this thing is a purpose-built device that's meant to do one thing really well: display games super fast without sacrificing on image quality. And if for some reason you get tired of playing games, you could do some photo or video editing as the display is Pantone Validated and covers 99 percent of the DCI-P3 spectrum.\nAside from the Odyssey OLED G6, today Samsung is also introducing a couple new additions to the Odyssey G7 line as well. The smaller of the two is the 37-inch Odyssey G7 which features more traditional dimensions including a 4K curved 16:9 VA panel with a typical brightness of 350 nits and a 165Hz refresh rate.\nSam Rutherford for Engadget\nAlternatively, for those who prefer ultra-wide monitors, the 40-inch Odyssey G7 has the same brightness and 1000R curve as its smaller sibling, but with a 21:9 WUHD (5,120 x 2160) resolution and a slightly faster 180Hz refresh rate. Interestingly, despite being the wider of the two, due to its 16:9 aspect ratio, the 37-inch Odyssey G7 looks larger in person. And thanks to their slightly higher brightness, both the 37 and 40-inch Odyssey G7 have VESA Display HDR 600 ratings.\nAll three monitors are on sale today. The Odyssey OLED G6 costs $1,000 while the 37-inch Odyssey G7 is going for $900 or $1,200 for the larger 40-inch Odyssey G7.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/the-samsung-odyssey-oled-g6-is-the-worlds-first-500hz-oled-gaming-monitor-180534184.html?src=rss",

    "full_text": "Perplexity, the AI startup responsible for the eponymous chatbot and LLM-powered search engine, has made a formal bid to purchase Google's Chrome browser. The proposed $34.5 billion deal would eclipse Perplexity's current valuation. Perplexity's bid comes after Google lost an antitrust suit initiated by the US Department of Justice last year. The Department of Justice's filing maintained that this would create a more equal playing field for search engine competitors. Google has not detailed any plans to divest itself of Chrome or change its business model. The judge's ruling on a remedy is expected this month. Perplexity has itself been eyed by large tech companies with an interest in the startup. Meta approached Perplexity for an acquisition earlier this year but a deal never materialized. If the plucky startup were to acquire the Chrome browser, it would give it a enormous advantage in the AI arms race -- where it's competing with much bigger fish, like Google, Meta and OpenAI. While Perplexity doesn't have comparable amounts of capital to expend on signing engineers, owning the largest search engine in the world will help build the company's signature agentic search engine AI models."

While there are two new color options, the Gen 2 model doesn't look any different from the original but it includes an LE Audio smart case, allowing wireless streaming from any device with USB-C or 3.5mm port (I tested it with inflight entertainment and it worked well, with no audio lag). The Elite 8 Active Gen 2 also feature enhanced spatial sound powered by Dolby Audio \"for a better music experience,\" enhanced Natural HearThrough for better awareness when outdoors, and improved noise-canceling performance. Soundcore by Anker Sport X10: The Soundcore Sport X10 have an interesting design with rotating swiveling ear hooks that flip up when you're using them and flip down when you want to set them in their charging case, which has a smaller footprint than a lot of buds with ear hooks. Battery life is rated at up to eight hours with an additional three charges in the charging case. It's very good for listening to podcasts, audiobooks and news broadcasts while you run. Skullcandy Push Active : With their ear-hook design, they're essentially a more affordable version of the Beats Powerbeats Pro and they actually fit my ears slightly better than the Powerbeats Pro -- I'm not usually a fan of ear-hook style buds, but these are one of the better models.

This hack gives an almost-unprecedented look inside the operation of Kimsuky, given that the two hackers compromised one of the group’s members, rather than investigating a data breach as cybersecurity researchers and companies typically have to rely on. “It shows a glimpse how openly ‘Kimsuky’ cooperates with Chinese [government hackers] and shares their tools and techniques,” the hackers wrote. An illustration of North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un, which was included in the phrack article. The two hackers clearly believe Kimsuky members deserve to be exposed and embarrassed. “Kimsuky, you’re not a hacker. “You hack for all the wrong reasons.” The hackers wrote that they were able to identify Kim as a North Korean government hacker, thanks to “artifacts and hints” that pointed in that direction, including files configurations and domains previously attributed to the North Korean hacking group Kimsuky. The hackers also noted Kim’s “strict office hours, always connecting at around 09:00 and disconnecting by 17:00 Pyongyang time.”"

    "summary": "Alien: Earth delivers everything you'd want from a series with \"Alien\" in the title: The iconic Xenomorphs hunting down hapless humans; gratuitous body horror; and androids who you can never fully trust. But writer/director Noah Hawley (Legion, Fargo) and his team also manage to push the franchise to new heights, delving into the philosophical questions that Ridley Scott's Prometheus and Alien Covenant couldn't fully explore. It's not just merely an Alien TV show — it's a meticulously crafted experience that elevates the entire franchise, even more so than the recent Alien: Romulus.\nThe series, which premieres today on FX and Hulu, takes place two years before the original Alien. It starts with the familiar: A group of astronauts awakening from cryosleep on a retro-futuristic-Weyland Yutani shipping vessel. We learn they're carrying precious extraterrestrial cargo, which predictably breaks loose and wreaks havoc throughout the ship. Meanwhile on Earth (somewhere we haven't seen at all in the franchise), we're introduced to a terminally ill child undergoing a radical new procedure: having her brain uploaded into a Synthetic body (played by Sydney Chandler).\n\nThis child takes the name Wendy — one of many Peter Pan references in the series — and embraces her new (and more mature) robotic body with childlike wonder. Instead of just being a frail kid, she becomes incredibly strong, with fast reflexes and the ability to jump down safely from great heights. It's like she's become an anime heroine a la Battle Angel Alita (at one point, she straps on a katana-like sword simply because it looks badass).\nWendy isn't human, but she's not a total android either since her personality and memories are uploaded from a human brain. She's something entirely new. She becomes a sort of older sibling to other sick kids going through the same human-Synthetic hybridization process, and together they form their own spin on the Lost Boys (including some girls). They even go so far as to take names from Peter Pan characters (one kid, unfortunately, gets stuck with the name Smee, after Captain Hook's cowardly lackey). And to her creator, Prodigy Corporation head Boy Kavalier (Samuel Blenkin), she's the key to a future where people can cheat death and practically live forever in synthetic bodies.\nFX\nThe alien-filled spaceship ends up crash-landing in one of Prodigy's cities in Southeast Asia (in this universe, five mega-corporations run the world, nation states no longer exist), and Boy Kavalier recklessly decides to test his new hybrid superteam with a rescue mission. They discover one survivor, Morrow (Babou Ceesay), a loyal security officer with a badass robotic arm, as well as a classic Xenomorph and a slew of new species. I won't spoil much about them here, but I have a feeling the cheeky multi-eyeball parasite will quickly become a fan-favorite.\nAlien: Earth finally immerses us in elements of the franchise the movies could only hint at. We see what a completely corporate-run Earth looks like, and it's as gross as you'd imagine. As usual, Weyland-Yutani prioritizes its extraterrestrial treasures over the lives of its workers. But it's even more sickening to see Boy Kavalier — the sort of obnoxious tech bro who defiantly puts his bare feet on desks during meetings — salivate at the opportunity to steal and study the alien cargo. Never mind the hundreds (and potentially thousands) of lives lost in his own city, or the inherent dangers in bringing deadly alien creatures into his research lab.\nTimothy Olyphant as Kirsh.Patrick Brown/FX\nThe series is at its best when it interrogates the big questions posed (with more or less deftness) by the films about the nature of being human. And where does that leave the new hybrids, who combine human memory and emotion with Synthetic bodies, who are somewhat immortal? In many ways, Alien :Earth seems just as cynical about humanity's value to the world as Scott's films. Humans will sacrifice countless lives for greed — maybe the planet would actually be better off without us.\nWith Prometheus, Ridley Scott aimed to explore the hubris of humans attempting to meet their creator, and the possibility the Synthetics (like Michael Fassbender’s David) may be more of evolved lifeforms. But the broader themes were bogged down by weak scripts (and from what I’ve heard, Scott’s own interference in the story). Alien: Covenant was even less memorable. Both films suffered from the demands of being big-budget blockbusters – they couldn’t slow down long enough to let the audience think, instead they had to rush to the next set piece. An eight-episode TV series made for a streaming network doesn’t have to play by the same rules.\nBabou Ceesay as Morrow in Alien: Earth.Patrick Brown/FX\nEven if you don’t want to engage with bigger ideas, though, Alien: Earth remains an embarrassment of riches. It features entirely new ways for extraterrestrials, not just Xenomorphs, to dismember their victims. It’s filled with fantastic performances across the board — Sydney Chandler, who has more of Wendy’s spunky energy than her Peter Pan namesake, is a standout. Babou Ceesay’s Morrow is ostensibly an antagonist, but it’s heartbreaking to see what he gives up to become a dutiful corporate underling. (His robotic arm can also whip out a sick Wolverine-like blade. How can you not love that?!)\nFans of the great Timothy Olyphant (Justified, Deadwood) will certainly appreciate his performance as Kirsh, Boy Kavalier’s Synthetic security head. We don’t get the playful side of Olyphant that we saw in Justified, but it’s endlessly entertaining to see his contempt for all humans (including his own boss) simmering beneath the surface.\nI’ll admit, I was skeptical that Noah Hawley could deliver a decent Alien TV series. Legion was all style and no substance in my opinion, and while I enjoyed the first few seasons of Fargo, the end of its run was uneven. But with Alien: Earth, he has made something special. It’s not the thematic upgrade that Andor was for Star Wars, but it’s a sign that there’s still plenty of life left in the aging Alien franchise.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/tv-movies/alien-earth-succeeds-where-ridley-scotts-alien-sequels-failed-173234905.html?src=rss",

In June 2025, Threads’ mobile app for iOS and Android saw 115.1 million daily active users, marking a 127.8% increase compared to the previous year. On the other hand, X reached 132 million daily active users, reflecting a 15.2% year-over-year decline.

Apple announced a Live Translation tool at WWDC25, but AirPods weren't mentioned as a potential use case scenario. This feels like a natural extension for the feature that we already know is coming to FaceTime, Messages and phone calls. However, the AirPods software will be used for live in-person conversations. \nAlso, this isn't the first time we've heard rumblings that the software would be coming to Apple's line of earbuds. Bloomberg announced it was likely coming back in March, which was well before WWDC. Wearables are the perfect place for any kind of live translation software and we've already seen it pop up in stuff like the Meta Ray-Bans smart glasses.\nThere are still some unknowns. We don't know if the feature will run entirely on the actual earbuds or if it'll require an iPhone. The latter is likely, given that it seems tied to iOS 26. We also don't know which iPhones will support the software, though it'll likely be on models that offer Apple Intelligence.

To support its development, Cassette offers an optional premium subscription (dubbed “ColorPlus”) that allows users to manually select a VHS tape instead of having the app play a video at random. There’s also an affordable Lifetime unlock for $7.99, which can go a long way toward supporting indie projects like this."

This is not a new issue, but as the SRM duopoly held by Northrop Grumman and L3Harris’ Aerojet Rocketdyne is increasingly challenged by Anduril and others, it highlights a vulnerability in the supply chain. The Pentagon backed a “merger-to-monopoly” in the 1990s, preferring to have one healthy provider rather than two struggling companies that couldn’t be competitive without government subsidies, he said. “It’s just enough orders and lead time to create the fuel.” AMPAC did not respond to TechCrunch’s request for comment on the status of that new line.

We'll almost certainly get a release date here too.\nGiven that Microsoft has said Hollow Knight: Silksong will be playable on PC and ROG Xbox Ally X at its Gamescom booth, and the game is still slated to arrive this year, this event seems as good a time as any for us to finally get a release date for that thing — over six years after we first got to try it out. There will certainly be more eyeballs on ONL than Microsoft's own streams, so that seems like the likeliest bet for any concrete Silksong news at Gamescom.\nYou can also expect a trailer for multiplayer RPG Honor of Kings: World, along with new looks at Resident Evil Requiem, Silent Hill f, Daemon X Machina: Titanic Scion and The Seven Deadly Sins: Origin. You'll get to see the opening cinematic for World of Warcraft's Midnight expansion as well. It won't all be game reveals and announcements, though — there'll be a performance of music from Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 featuring composer Lorien Testard and vocalist Alice Duport-Percier.\nWe'll be keeping tabs on all the news from Opening Night Live right here on Engadget. Myself, senior editor Jess Conditt and editor-in-chief Aaron Souppouris will be live-blogging our way through ONL. Join us! It should be fun.\nHow to watch Xbox @ gamescom 2025 Broadcast — August 20, 9AM ET\nWatch on YouTube, Twitch, TikTok or Facebook\nOne major piece of news we're likely to get from Xbox during one of its streams (if it isn't revealed at ONL beforehand) is the release date and pricing for the ASUS ROG Xbox Ally and Xbox Ally X handheld systems. Leaker billbil-kun has reported the devices will arrive on October 16, at least in Europe, costing €599 for the Xbox Ally and €899 for the higher-end Xbox Ally X.\nMicrosoft had already confirmed these handhelds would be available in time for the holiday season, so that rumored release date makes sense. Either way, we should get confirmation during Gamescom of when to expect these devices, especially since the company says it will discuss the handhelds during its August 20 stream. This particular event will also feature the likes of Grounded 2, Keeper and Call of Duty: Black Ops 7.\nAlong with the English-language broadcast, Xbox's streams will be available in other languages on regional Xbox channels on the likes of YouTube, Twitch, TikTok and Facebook. The streams will be available in Traditional Chinese, German, French, Japanese, Brazilian Portuguese and Mexican Spanish, as well as with ASL and English audio descriptions.\nHow to watch Future Games Show — August 20, 2PM ET\nWatch on Twitch or YouTube\n\nActors David Hayter (Snake in the Metal Gear series) and Maggie Robertson (Lady Dimitrescu in Resident Evil Village) will be hosting this edition of the Future Games Show. This installment will feature more than 50 games across world premieres, new trailers and sudden demo releases. \nCapcom, Bandai Namco Entertainment, EA and NACON are among those who'll be represented in this one, which will feature projects from AAA and indie publishers and studios. A post-show will run for 40 minutes and feature more trailers, world premieres and demo announcements.\nHow to watch Xbox @ gamescom 2025 Broadcast — August 21, 9AM ET\nWatch on YouTube, Twitch, TikTok or Facebook\nXbox will be broadcasting live from the Gamescom show floor for a second straight day. This particular stream will include details on Ninja Gaiden 4, The Outer Worlds 2, Overwatch 2 (perhaps with a look at Season 18, which is set to start on August 26) and other games. Microsoft plans to reveal more details about its schedule in the days leading up to Gamescom.\nHow to watch Bethesda broadcasts - August 22\nWatch on Twitch\nThere will be plenty from the Bethesda side of the Xbox division as well. The publisher will be broadcasting from the Xbox show floor at Gamescom for three days, starting on August 22. According to Microsoft, these streams will include \"developer interviews, game showcases, community segments, crafting highlights and live IRL tours.\"This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/how-to-watch-gamescom-2025-and-what-to-expect-120024733.html?src=rss",

One of the best right now is on Apple's M3-powered iPad Air, which is somewhat of a goldilocks tablet — one that will be a great option for just about everyone. You can grab it for $150 off at Amazon right now.\nThis deal applies to each configuration of the 11-inch and 13-inch versions of the most recent iPad Air. So, the 11-inch model is as low as $449, while the 13-inch model is down to $649. The same deals can be found at Best Buy and Target if you prefer to shop somewhere other than Amazon. This is an all-time low price and beats the deal we saw on Prime Day by $30. \n \nThe iPad Air M3 is more of an iterative refresh than a grand overhaul, but the spec bump means it’ll last you a long time before the tablet’s performance becomes a problem. This iPad occupies the position of \"best for most\" in our iPad buying guide, reinforcing that goldilocks analogy. The M3 chip is the main draw here, with Geekbench 6 scores proclaiming it around 16 percent more powerful than the M2 iPad Air, which is no slouch itself.\nBeyond the chip, it has a superior display and speakers to the entry-level model, and wider accessory support. You also get the option of a 13-inch display, which is great for artists or anyone who sees the iPad as a viable laptop replacement.\nIf there’s an obvious downside to the iPad Air M3, it’s that it doesn't have the nice 120Hz OLED display of the iPad Pro. This is hardly surprising, as Apple often focuses on display tech to differentiate its Pro and non-Pro devices, but it’s probably time the refresh rate on the middle-of-the-road iPad at least jumped up to ProMotion. Face ID is long overdue too. If you can live with these caveats, though, the iPad Air is an excellent option, particularly at this price.\nCheck out our coverage of the best Apple deals for more discounts, and follow @EngadgetDeals on X for the latest tech deals and buying advice.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/apples-ipad-air-m3-drops-to-a-new-record-low-price-162908915.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "There's arguably no piece of tech more important for a college student than a good laptop. Whether you’re working on an essay, doing research for a paper or just need some downtime streaming your favorite show, a solid laptop for college is an investment that can (and should) last you for years. While the best laptops come in all shapes and sizes and range in price, college students don’t need a power-hungry machine or a notebook with the latest graphics card to get things done. For most, the best laptop for college is ideally thin and lightweight, and provides enough battery to last all day without having to be tethered to the wall. No matter what you’re studying, we’ve researched and tested a range of laptops for you to consider as you decide which is the best laptop for college for you.\nWhat to consider in your next laptop for college\nIt’s important to consider your major and what you need your laptop to do before deciding on the best laptop for college. For example, if you’re a liberal arts major and will mostly be writing or making presentations, you don’t need an expensive system with a discrete graphics card. Alternatively, if you’re a film major who might need to render videos on a regular basis, having a beefy PC can significantly reduce the time it takes to finish a project. You’ll also want to take a look at any guidelines provided by your college or your specific program, as you may need required software or apps that only run on a specific OS. \nSome other things to consider are if you want a more portable 13 or 14-inch machine that’s easier to carry around, or if you prefer something with a larger screen. On top of that, if you are doing tasks like photo or video editing, you’ll probably want to go for a system with a high-resolution display (1440p or 4K), so it's easier to see details. As for other specs, ideally you’ll want 16GB of RAM (though you can go down to 8GB on a Chromebook) and at least 512GB or 1TB of storage. Most newer laptops now come with SSD storage, too, which means you can store and transfer data much faster.\nFinally, while your budget ultimately will determine how powerful of a laptop you can get, well-equipped ultraportables will generally cost between $1,000 and $1,400, with prices going up from there for systems with discrete GPUs. Budget Windows laptops and Chromebooks can be affordable alternatives though, with many going for just $500 to $700. But again, remember to check your school’s requirements because it’s not worth saving a few bucks only to find out that your notebook can’t run the app you need for all your homework.\nSee Also:\n\nBest Laptops for 2025\nBest Gaming Laptops\nBest 2-in-1 Laptops for 2025\nBest Chromebooks\nBest Cheap Windows Laptops for 2025\n\nThe best laptops for college students\n \n \n \n \nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/best-laptops-for-students-130054631.html?src=rss",

Both MacBook Air models lasted for well over 18 hours in our tests, so they’ll likely last you two work days without needing to be juiced up. And while they’re far from gaming PCs, we were still impressed to see them run the graphically intensive game Lies of P at 60fps in 1080p. So if you're looking for a portable and well-rounded Windows PC, it's hard to go wrong with the Dell 14 Premium. All of this comes in an unibody aluminum chassis that weighs just 3.3 pounds, which is the same as a 15-inch MacBook Air. Put simply, the ROG G14 is one of the best laptops in its class, which makes it a great choice for students that are dabbling in a bunch of different subjects or disciplines. Also, if you like the G14’s mix of performance and design but want something a touch larger, there’s the ROG Zephyrus G16 which supports up to an RTX 5090 GPU."

    "summary": "A mouse may seem like a small consideration for your workstation setup. But after you’ve addressed the crucial ergonomics — raising your monitor to eye-level, using the right keyboard and taking frequent breaks throughout your workdays — it’s a good idea to make sure the mouse you use is comfortable as well. People dealing with conditions like carpal tunnel and wrist pain may be interested in finding the best ergonomic mouse for them. Vertical and semi-vertical designs turn your palm towards your midline instead of downwards, creating a handshake position that may feel more natural. Others employ a trackball to minimize the work your shoulder has to do in a day. I tested out more than 20 highly regarded ergonomic mice to come up with recommendations for vertical, semi-vertical, trackball and more, along with advice about the merits of the different ergonomic designs.\nTable of contents\n\nWhat to look for in an ergonomic mouse\nHow we test ergonomic mice\nBest ergonomic mouse for 2025\nOther ergonomic mice we tested\n\nBest ergonomic mouse for 2025\n \n \n \n \n \nWhat to look for in an ergonomic mouse\nLike everything related to ergonomics, the mouse design that works best for you will depend on your body and what you need to do on a typical day. So the shapes, added features and how the mouse communicates with your computer will determine which you should get. \nTypes and shapes of ergonomic mice\nWhen we’re talking about ergonomic mice for productivity purposes, it usually refers to mice that look distinctly different from the standard, typically with shapes that tilt your hand towards a more “handshake” position instead of facing your palm downward. A vertical ergonomic mouse has the most severe up-and-down angle, semi-vertical mice split the difference and trackball models stay put on your desk while your thumb controls the movement of the cursor. Gaming mice have an ergonomic category as well, but that simply refers to a mouse with curves designed to fit either the right or left hand. It differentiates those mice from ambidextrous models, which don’t conform to a particular hand.\nEach of three ergonomic mice shapes can help address different concerns. If you’re trying to avoid twisting your forearm, a vertical mouse could be what you need. Clicking a vertical mouse feels more like pinching your finger and thumb together, which could relieve certain other wrist issues as well.\nA semi-vertical mouse feels the most like a traditional computer mouse, with an angle closer to 50 or 60 degrees from your desk. Semi-vertical mouse clicks can feel easier too, since you're pushing down instead of pinching. Some vertical and semi-vertical mice have an optional flange that supports the heel of your palm. Instead of pivoting on those bones to make your cursor move, your palm and wrist stay aligned and the entire arm controls the motion.\nA trackball mouse can also keep your wrist from bending, as it keeps your forearm planted. My personal struggle is with neck and shoulder tension, so trackballs and very lightweight vertical mice work best for me as their configuration lets me keep my forearm from moving. \nDPI, weight and buttons\nAs this guide focuses on productivity mice, gaming-specific stats like polling rates and IPS values don’t really come into play. (My colleague Jeff Dunn does a good job of explaining those metrics in his gaming mouse review guide.) What matters here are numbers like DPI, or dots per inch, which indicates how sensitive a mouse is. The higher the setting, the faster your cursor will move across the screen. Low DPI settings let you do precision work like pixel-by-pixel editing in Photoshop. All the mice here have at least two and as many as five settings, ranging from 400 to 3,200 DPI. Mice that make it easy to switch from high to low DPI might make sense if you do a lot of detailed work.\nWeight makes a difference in vertical and semi-vertical mice (but not trackballs, since they stay put). A lighter model will be easier to move around, which could put less strain on your wrist and arm. That said, a little weight can make your movements feel more precise. For reference, a featherweight gaming mouse might weigh 45 grams and a large vertical mouse with a flange attached might weigh 140 grams. The latter may feel a little heavy, but if it has smooth feet and is used with a decent mouse pad, it will feel lighter.\nIt's always nice to have easily clickable buttons, but that matters even more when body health is a concern. Pressing hard on a button tenses up my arm and shoulder like nobody’s business. Since it’s an action desk workers perform hundreds or thousands of times a day, it's essential that it be effortless — nothing ruled out a mouse quicker in my tests than tough buttons.\n\n\n\n\nExtra features\nAll mice have the basics: a right and left button and a scroll wheel. All mice in this guide also have a DPI selector button. Some have other functions such as a scroll wheel that can click with a press or handle horizontal scrolling by tilting the wheel to the right or left. Many also have back and forward buttons for browser windows, and sometimes those two are programmable to perform different functions in other apps.\nMore complex mice have additional buttons to customize, typically using a mouse’s proprietary software. Depending on that software, you can set buttons to mute calls, copy and paste, undo and redo, switch tabs and more. Performing multiple functions without extraneous movement is a big plus in ergonomic design. Of course, there are a number of keyboards that let you program multiple functions into specific keys, which cuts down on superfluous movement even more, which you can read about in our ergonomic keyboard guide.\nConnectivity and compatibility\nAll the mice here will work with Mac's operating system as well as Microsoft Windows, and some work with Chrome, Linnux and even iPadOS (though I didn’t test those) as well. They connect in three ways: Wired, via Bluetooth or with a 2.4Ghz wireless dongle. More devices have incorporated USB-C interfaces, but most mice still use USB-A. So if you have a laptop that only sports USB-C ports (looking at you, MacBook), you’ll need an adapter to use a wired or dongle-enabled mouse. You can use a hub or docking station for this purpose, but in testing this guide, I ran into connectivity issues using a wireless USB receiver in a docking station, particularly when there wasn’t a direct and completely clear path between the mouse and receiver. Everything worked far more reliably with just a direct USB-C to A adapter.\nThe difference between wireless and Bluetooth is twofold: a wireless dongle connection tends to be quicker to set up. You just plug in the accessory, turn on the mouse (potentially granting permission for the device) and you’re set. For Bluetooth, you need to open the settings menu, activate pairing mode on the mouse, search for the mouse and then click connect. There’s also a bit more latency when using Bluetooth versus a wireless mouse. It’s not something most people will notice doing workaday stuff, but if you plan on playing some Overwatch after hours and want to use the same mouse, you might want to go with the faster, 2.4Ghz route.\nHow we test ergonomic mice\nAfter many hours of research and reading reviews, I gathered just over 20 mice with good claims to ergonomic design to test in my work setup. I mostly tried out mice geared towards a work-from-home or office setting, as opposed to gaming (we have a whole guide dedicated to that topic). I used each mouse for a few hours or a few days, noting how well they felt as well as how they performed. I mostly used a MacBook Pro M1 but verified Windows compatibility with an Asus ROG Strix laptop. For reference, my right hand measures 7.25 inches from the wrist crease to the tip of my middle finger, which is just under average for a man and large for a woman.\nOther ergonomic mice we tried\nRazer Pro Click V2 Vertical\nI was thrilled to see a gaming company announce a vertical mouse. In gaming peripherals, the term \"ergonomic\" just means “not ambidextrous” as in, designed for the right (or left) hand. To be fair, Razer calls this a productivity mouse and a rep told me it was meant for those who work often and occasionally want to game with the same mouse. But still, the Pro Click V2 Vertical mouse is at least gaming adjacent and has an actual ergo design. The handshake position is nice and upright, forcing very little twisting in your forearm. It’s immediately apparent how well built it is, plus it’s lightweight, glides easily and nicely fits in the hand. It has three connectivity options: Bluetooth, wired or USB-A dongle. And, because this is Razer, you also get some sweet, sweet RGB lights at the bottom.\nUnfortunately, I think Razer’s Basilisk V3 is still a better ergonomic mouse for gaming. Even though it doesn’t have the tilted handshake position, I vastly preferred using it to the Pro Click V2 Vertical. The V2 Vertical has a small flange that supports the pinky, but my palm was left to pinch against the desk, so I found myself lifting my arm a lot. While the Hyperspeed dongle is quite responsive, the Bluetooth connection was consistently slow to wake. Using the mouse wired wasn’t great either, as the weight of the cable was more noticeable with a tilted position. The right and left buttons required only a light touch if my hand fully grasped the mouse, but if I backed off the grip a little, the buttons were tough to click.\nFinally, for a gaming mouse, there aren’t a ton of programmable buttons: just right, left, scroll, DPI and a forward/back pair surrounding the thumb slot. There are some great ideas here and, like most things Razer makes, the build is top-notch, so I’m excited to see if the brand’s next effort in the area of ergonomic gaming mouse addresses a few of this model’s drawbacks.\nLogitech MX Master 3S\nLogitech mice have made many appearances in our guides over the years. In our guide to the best productivity mice, we name the Logitech MX Master 3S the best wireless mouse you can get. As I considered its merits as a mouse, it was indeed an impressive option — it connected flawlessly, has a useful sideways wheel as well as the traditional scroll feature and the thumb rest is a nice touch. But the ergonomics didn't quite do it for me as it holds your hand in the standard, palm-down, claw-grip position.\nLogitech Lift Vertical\nThe Logi Lift Vertical is likely one of the more popular ergonomic mice out there. It’s fairly lightweight, has an attractive design with a nice feel to the exterior. The buttons are easy to click and nearly silent. It also connects quickly using either Bluetooth or a dongle. Unfortunately, it doesn’t glide across the mouse pad all that smoothly, and the pinch grip the design requires actually aggregated my wrist. The cursor movements are fairly precise, though I occasionally had trouble getting the cursor to land just where I wanted it. Also, it’s small; my hands are too large for the Lift. Logitech’s Logitech MX Vertical is essentially a larger version, but again, the skinnier shape was uncomfortable in my hands and it was tough to get the cursor to go where I wanted it to.\nHP 920 ergonomic vertical\nThe HP 920 ergonomic vertical also has a flange for resting your palm, but it makes the mouse overly heavy to move around. Without it, however, it's an extremely comfortable mouse with a premium feel, rechargeable battery, and two programmable thumb buttons. Unfortunately, the cursor movement was frustratingly imprecise and didn’t go exactly where I pointed, forcing a number of corrections — and extraneous movement is what we’re trying to avoid in ergonomic setups.\nTurtle Beach Pure Air\nApart from the rather loud clicks, I was impressed with the build and performance of the Turtle Beach Pure Air. It’s lightweight, moves smoothly, and has impressively accurate cursor movements. But despite being labeled an ergonomic mouse, it’s particularly light on the ergonomics. There’s a divot for your right thumb, so it can't be called ambidextrous, but beyond that it’s a pretty standard (albeit quite nice) gaming mouse.\nPerixx Perimice 719\nThe PERIMICE-719 from Perixx is a solid mouse with an exterior that feels nice to the touch. It has a comfortable, semi-vertical design, accurate cursor moves and a satisfyingly ratcheted scroll wheel. Plus, it offers reliable connectivity with a wireless dongle and only costs $22. Unfortunately, it was too small for my hand. Only folks with smaller glove sizes (or don’t mind adopting more of a fingertip grip) will be able to get the most out of this one.\nAnker 2.4G vertical\nThe Anker 2.4G mouse could make a decent budget pick for anyone who doesn't mind using more of a pinch grip on their peripheral. It's lightweight and has a precise scroll wheel along with back and forward browser buttons. It's battery operated, but doesn't come with batteries and only connects via the included USB radio dongle. I also found the buttons a little harder to press which ultimately eliminated it from the running.  This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-ergonomic-mouse-120004931.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "The closer we get to Apple's reveal of the iPhone 17 lineup, the more excited we are to see what's different from the previous iPhones. The newest smartphones will come equipped with the latest iOS 26 features. Since we still have to wait at least a month (presumably) until the iPhone event, we can at least speculate what the new phones will look like. As with most unreleased iPhone models, rumors and leaks have trickled in about the hardware side ahead of the official introduction. Here's what we're expecting and what we can reasonably assume we'll get from Cupertino in September.\nWhat are the latest iPhone 17 rumors and reports?\nWill the iPhone 17 Pro have better wireless signal strength thanks to an updated antenna design? That's the implication from Majin Bu, whom MacRumors classifies as a \"hit-or-miss leaker.\" The individual posted a render on X today (see below) that shows a new antenna system that wraps around the iPhone 17 Pro's supposedly wider rear camera bump.\niPhone 17 Pro New Antenna DesignFull Article:https://t.co/nivzKiY8xy pic.twitter.com/jgbwLteaPO— Majin Bu (@MajinBuOfficial) August 11, 2025\n\nAgain, this is a render, not a real-world photo, and — like all such stories ahead of the official announcement — should be treated with the usual grain of salt. That said, we can't knock the goal of better wireless reception, so we're hoping this one has a degree of truth to it.\nHow much will the iPhone 17 cost?\nApple's announced plan to expand US-based manufacturing partners seems to give it at least some shielding from the steepest Trump administration tariffs that have already triggered price increases on everything from Switch consoles to high-end cameras to Sonos speakers. But given that President Trump's trade policies can change from week to week, and Apple's continuing reliance on Asia-based supply chains, price shocks remain an ongoing possibility. The bigger question is: Will Apple absorb any higher costs, or pass them on to consumers? \nIf prices do creep up, Apple may choose to pair it it with an \"upgrade.\" Consider this recent rumor posted by MacRumors from a leaker known as \"Instant Digital,\" suggesting that the default storage of the iPhone 17 line may start at 256GB, doubling the current 128GB baseline. While that could be accompanied by a price increase of $50, Apple could at least pitch it as a \"better value.\" That said, the company doubled the default RAM of its Mac computers from 8GB to 16GB at no extra cost in 2024 — but that was before the current Trump tariff cycle started.\nWhen will the iPhone 17 series be announced?\nMost years, the flagship smartphones are introduced in September. MacRumors highlighted a story originally reported by iphone-ticker.de that the Apple iPhone 17 event could be Tuesday, September 9, according to information gleaned from German mobile phone providers.\nIt's still too early to have the specific dates; some years, Apple only gives a week or two of lead time between sending invites and hosting the event. But years of past precedent show that sometime in September should be when the 17 models make their debut. This family of smartphones may be the last to follow that trend, however. There have been hints that the introduction of the iPhone 18 collection in 2026 will be split into a pro-tier announcement in the fall and a standard model announcement the following spring.\nWhat will the new iPhone 17 lineup include?\nDesign leaks suggest that Apple is building an ultra-thin smartphone, likely to be named the iPhone 17 Air to match Apple's ultralight laptop designation. Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, often a solid source of advanced intel about Apple, reported in January that the iPhone 17 Air will be equipped with a basic A19 chip and will only have a single camera lens. It may also use Apple's new in-house modem, which was introduced in February on the iPhone 16e. More details about this development may leak ahead of September, but that's what we know for now.\nAn investor note from Apple analyst Jeff Pu indicated that the Air will have a titanium frame. If his reports are accurate, the lightweight smartphone will be the only entry in the iPhone 17 lineup to use that metal; the iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone 17 Pro Max are expected to be made of aluminum, which is oddly a lighter material than titanium. Other speculation had suggested that the Air would use a blend of aluminum and titanium, so the exact materials may not be known until the official announcement.\nAdditionally, an August 4 MacRumors report says the internal battery pack of the iPhone Air is just 2.49mm thick — half the thickness of the iPhone 17 Pro battery. The leak was posted on the Korean-langauge Naver blog, where they show the alleged batteries of the iPhone 17 Air and 17 Pro side by side. The same account claimed the 17 Air's battery capacity was a mere 2,800 mAh, MacRumors notes. (That's below the battery capacity of current iPhone 16 models.)\nEach new roster includes a base model, but over the years, Apple has shaken up the variety of phones it offers. Most likely there will be an iPhone 17 and an iPhone 17 Pro. Apple has also committed to the size matters philosophy, and has been building an iPhone Pro Max option with an even bigger screen and better battery life; the 17 roster will almost certainly have one as well. \nThe new Pro iPhones are said to have a full-width \"camera island\" on the rear, which would mark the first time an Apple model opted for that design. This feature can be seen in the purported iPhone 17 \"spotted in the wild.\" The pics, highlighted on MacRumors, show a black cased iPhone (17 Pro?) with the distinct back panel. Is it the real deal? The dual angles lend a degree of credibility in a social media landscape increasingly polluted with AI-enhanced fakes, but your guess is as good as ours.\nI just spotted a test development iPhone in the wild 🤩🤩🤩 pic.twitter.com/iS3PtKWqxJ— Fox Pupy 🦊🧡 (@Skyfops) July 28, 2025\n\nThe iPhone 17 Air seems primed to take the place of a potential iPhone 17 Plus. Since the iPhone 16e was only just introduced in February at a surprisingly high price point, it seems unlikely that there will be a new addition to that lower end of the spectrum, the models that were previously called SE. \nAt the very least, it sounds like the iPhone 17 Air won't take away the charging port and rely only on wireless connectivity. Bloomberg said that while Apple had investigated making the iPhone 17 Air without a single port, the company (fortunately) changed plans. He also says that the rumored phone will have a 6.6-inch screen and include the Dynamic Island and Camera Control button. Finally, the price is rumored at $900 — likely more than the standard iPhone 17 but less than the Pro.\nWe've also gotten what seems to be a reliable look at what the color lineup will be for the new smartphones. Macworld reported that the iPhone 17 will be available in black, white, steel gray, green, purple and light blue. The iPhone 17 Air will reportedly have four color options: black, white, light blue and light gold. While the Air colors will be less saturated, the visuals for the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max will go bold. The options for the Pro models are expected to be black, white, gray, dark blue and orange.\nOn July 30, Tom's Guide highlighted an X post from Sonny Dickson — a longtime and generally reliable leaker of unreleased iPhone information — showing \"dummy\" iPhone 17 models in the new colors that were the source of the aforementioned Macworld story. While these are literally just mock-ups — not real, leaked iPhones — it's interesting to see how the design and color rumors translate into a real-world look and feel.\nWhat will iOS 26 be like?\nApple upended its numbering conventions with WWDC 2025, and will match the name of each new operating system to the year it's released. So when the next wave of iPhones hits, they'll be running on iOS 26.\nOn the design side, the smartphone OS introduced during the big developer showcase took a contentious approach dubbed Liquid Glass. Apple has been scaling down the amount of transparency effects in the subsequent beta tests of iOS 26, but it will still have a glass-like visual.\nThe feature list includes big and small updates. On the more impactful side, the Phone and Photos apps have been redesigned. There will be several features leveraging artificial intelligence, such as live translation capabilities coming to Phone, FaceTime and Messages. Apple is also currently testing a sensitive content warning for child accounts that will freeze FaceTime video if nudity is detected by on-device machine learning tools. And the company is also launching Visual Intelligence, which will use AI to search for elements in an image.\niOS 26 also has a litany of minor, quality of life improvements. Group texts are getting support for polls. And for the slow risers out there, iOS 26 will finally let you escape the tyranny of the nine minute snooze alarm. \nThe next iOS is now available as a public beta. Here are our initial impressions of the Liquid Glass design and other new features. iOS 26 is compatible with all models back through iPhone 11.\nUpdate, August 11, 2025, 7:27PM ET: Added a render of a rumored new antenna design for the iPhone 17 Pro.\nUpdate, August 8, 2025, 4:43PM ET: Added new speculation and reports about iPhone 17 pricing.\nUpdate, August 6, 2025, 4:05PM ET: Added latest details about the potential iPhone 17 event date.\nUpdate, August 4, 2025, 5:23PM ET: Added latest battery leaks about the iPhone 17 models.\nUpdate, August 1, 2025, 8:15AM ET: Added new photos showing potential iPhone 17 colors.\nUpdate, July 30, 2025, 11:08AM ET: Added latest leaks and rumors about the iPhone 17, and updated information on the iOS 26 public beta.\nUpdate, July 17, 2025, 4:40PM ET: Added latest information about iOS 26, possible materials for the Air, and the color options for the different models.\nUpdate, March 17, 2025, 2PM ET: Added details about the rumored price and features of the iPhone 17 Air.\nUpdate, April 11, 2025, 3:45PM ET: Added details from Front Page Tech's new video that claims to reveal details from a leaked iOS 19 build.\nKatie Teague contributed to this story.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/iphone-17-release-is-rumored-for-september-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-thinnest-iphone-ever-and-the-apple-fall-event-153024456.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "\nYour iPhone and iPad's operating systems are getting big upgrades this fall with the release of iOS 26 and iPadOS 26. My favorite coming to both is the visual update, called Liquid Glass — it's like the better-executed version of Windows Vista. We spent two weeks test-driving it — you can check out our detailed hands-on iOS 26 preview, or you can try it out yourself by downloading and installing the public beta. That software is a more stable iteration of the separate developer version, which recently hit the beta 6 waypoint, and offers a few more flashy features not yet available in the public version. (While the public beta is open to everyone and quite stable, always remember there's a degree of risk involved with beta software.) Not ready to upgrade your smartphone or tablet this year? No worries, we'll help you find out if your phone will be able to run iOS 26.\nWhile Apple didn't nix any iPhones from its eligibility list last year, that's not the case for 2025 — a few models are getting cut this time. All iPhone 8 models and the iPhone X were the last to get the boot in 2023, and this year the 2018 models are getting left behind. If you have an ineligible device, you won't be able to download iOS 26 when it becomes available this fall. \nWe'll get to the bottom of which iPhones and iPads will support iOS 26 and iPadOS 26 this year. To see what's coming with the latest OSes, check out everything announced at Apple's WWDC June 9 event. One thing you shouldn't immediately expect is Apple's updated version of Siri, though the company is reportedly working on a 'stripped-down' AI chatbot to compete with ChatGPT.\nThese three iPhones won't be compatible with iOS 26\nUnlike last year, several iPhone models won't be eligible to download the newest iOS when it makes its debut this fall. This trio of models first released in 2018 won't be coming to the iOS 26 party:\n\niPhone XR\niPhone XS\niPhone XS Max\n\niPhones compatible with iOS 26\nWhile we don't yet know the new iPhones Apple will be dropping this fall — though there are iPhone 17 rumors — we do know, per Apple's site, that the phones listed below will be compatible with iOS 26. Basically, if you have an iPhone that was announced in 2019 or later, you're in the clear:\n\niPhone SE (second generation or later)\niPhone 11\niPhone 11 Pro\niPhone 11 Pro Max\niPhone 12\niPhone 12 mini\niPhone 12 Pro\niPhone 12 Pro Max\niPhone 13\niPhone 13 mini\niPhone 13 Pro\niPhone 13 Pro Max\niPhone 14\niPhone 14 Plus\niPhone 14 Pro\niPhone 14 Pro Max\niPhone 15\niPhone 15 Plus\niPhone 15 Pro\niPhone 15 Pro Max\niPhone 16e\niPhone 16\niPhone 16 Plus\niPhone 16 Pro\niPhone 16 Pro Max\n\niPads compatible with iPadOS 26\nThe iPads listed below, and any iPads released later this year, are eligible to download iPadOS 26.\n\niPad Pro (M4)\niPad Pro 12.9‑inch (3rd generation and later)\niPad Pro 11‑inch (1st generation and later)\niPad Air (M3, M2)\niPad Air (3rd generation and later)\niPad (A16)\niPad (8th generation and later)\niPad mini (A17 Pro)\niPad mini (5th generation and later)\n\nWhat if I don't want to buy a new iPhone?\nIf you want to continue using your older iPhone that isn't supported by iOS 26, that's fine. However, you'll miss out on security updates which could potentially put your phone at risk for malware and other threats. Additionally, some apps may stop working if they require a certain version of iOS or later. And of course, you won't be able to access the latest features iOS 26 offers.\nWhen will iOS 26 become available?\nApple usually rolls out its latest iOS in mid-September, just a few days before the new iPhones hit store shelves. Last year, it released iOS 18 on Monday, Sept. 16. Expect a confirmation of the release date at the iPhone 17 event, expected in early September. \niOS 26 features we're excited about\nLiquid Glass design: Your home screen is getting revamped with new app icons, including dark mode and all-clear options. You'll also notice buttons with a new floating design. Liquid Glass was designed to make all of Apple's OSes more cohesive.\nPhone app redesign: You'll finally be able to scroll through contacts, recent calls and voicemail messages all on one screen. It also comes with a new feature called Hold Assist that'll notify you when an agent comes to the phone so you can avoid the elevator music.\nLive Translate: iOS 26 is bringing the ability to have a conversation via phone call or text message with someone who speaks another language. Live Translate will translate your conversation in real time. \nPolls feature: Coming to group messages in the Messages app, chat members will be able to create polls. This can help prevent the unwanted 30+ messages when it comes to deciding which restaurant you're meeting at this weekend.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/ready-for-apples-ios-26-here-are-all-the-compatible-iphones-that-can-run-the-beta-today-191854135.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Liquid Glass is a huge new change coming to iOS 26. (Apple)\nIn just over a month, we'll finally get to download the official iOS 26 on our iPhones. Available now is the iOS 26 developer beta 6 (for developers only), and the public beta which you can download and install now. CEO Tim Cook recently said it's (along with the other current beta operating systems) \"by far the most popular developer betas we’ve had,\" 9to5Mac reports. You can also take a look at our preview of the iOS 26 public beta release, which shows off the fresh home and lock screen redesign. Called Liquid Glass, the new translucent look will extend across all of Apple's upcoming operating systems. The overhaul is one of several big changes coming to iOS, macOS, iPadOS and the rest of Apple's software suite, all of which were showcased during the company's WWDC keynote on June 9.\nAfter overpromising on AI plans last year, Apple kept its iOS roadmap focused more on basic quality of life improvements this year. There are multiple useful additions coming to the Phone and Messages apps on your iPhone, for instance: Apple execs outlined the ability to weed out spam texts or other unknown senders and an option to hold your spot on a phone call when you've been waiting for a representative to pick up. Plus, a treasured feature that we took for granted is coming back (hint: it's in the Photos app).\nSiri, meanwhile, is in a holding pattern. Apple has previously specified that its smarter voice assistant — first promised at WWDC 2024 — is delayed until some point \"in the coming year,\" so you shouldn't expect any major changes in the current betas. But there are reports that Apple is aiming to give Siri a bigger brain transplant by basing it on third-party artificial intelligence models like OpenAI's ChatGPT or Anthropic's Claude, which could make 2026 a pivotal year. The company is also reportedly working on a 'stripped-down' AI chatbot to rival ChatGPT.\nWith each beta, it seems like additional new improvements are popping up, like this FaceTime feature that'll freeze your video if it detects nudity. With the release of the iOS 26 developer beta 5, we saw more added features, like a new bouncy animation on the passcode screen and in the Control Center, MacRumors reports. Some or all of those changes will likely soon migrate into the separate public beta (see below). Most newer iPhone models are eligible to download iOS 26 (both the betas and final version). Want to see the full list of new features coming this fall? Read on. \nWhat is iOS 26?\nThe current iPhone operating system is iOS 18, and Apple is still actively updating it — version 18.6 was just recently released. But don't expect to see iOS 19. Instead, Apple is skipping the numbering ahead to iOS 26 later this year. The company has decided to line up its iOS version numbers with a year-based system, similar to car model years. So while iOS and its sibling operating systems will be released in late 2025, they're all designated \"26\" to reflect the year ahead. \nIt's official, we're moving to iOS 26. (Apple)\nWhat is Liquid Glass design?\nLet's be honest. Out of everything announced at WWDC this year, the new Liquid Glass design was the star of the show. The iPhone's home and lock screens have looked pretty much the same year after year — the last exciting thing (in my opinion) was the option to add your own aesthetic to your home screen by customizing your apps and widgets. So seeing the home and lock screens' new facelift is refreshing.\nSo what exactly is Liquid Glass? Apple calls it a \"new translucent material\" since, well, the apps and widgets are clear. However, the screen can still adapt to dark and light modes, depending on surroundings. You'll also notice buttons with a new floating design in several apps, like Phone and Maps. They're designed to be less distracting than the current buttons, but are still easy to see. While the design overhaul has proven to be controversial since its announcement, some — including Engadget's own Devindra Hardawar — like the new direction, even if it's somewhat reminiscent of Microsoft's translucent Windows Vista Aero designs from nearly twenty years ago.\nThat said, as of the release of the iOS 26 beta 2, Apple has already incorporated some user feedback into the design, dialing back the transparency in at least some places. And while it will continue to evolve, Apple users won't be able to escape it: Liquid Glass was designed to make all of Apple's OSes more cohesive. Here's a look at how the translucent aesthetic will look with the new macOS Tahoe 26 on your desktop.\nWhat are the new and notable features of iOS 26?\niOS 26 has a laundry list of new features. Among the most worthwhile:\nPhone app redesign: You'll finally be able to scroll through contacts, recent calls and voicemail messages all on one screen. It also comes with a new feature called Hold Assist that'll notify you when an agent comes to the phone so you can avoid the elevator music and continue on with other tasks.\nLive Translation in Phone, FaceTime and Messages: iOS 26 is bringing the ability to have a conversation via phone call or text message with someone who speaks another language. Live Translation will translate your conversation in real time, which results in some stop-and-go interactions in the examples Apple shared during its presentation.\nPolls in group chats: Tired of sorting through what seems like hundreds of messages in your group chat? You and your friends will soon be able to create polls in group messages for deciding things like which brunch spot you're eating at or whose car you're taking on a road trip.\nFiltering unknown senders in Messages: If you haven't received spam texts about unpaid tolls or other citations, you're lucky. For those of us who have, those annoying messages will soon be filtered away in a separate folder.\nVisual Intelligence: Similar to a reverse Google image search, this new feature will allow you to search for anything that's on your iPhone screen. For instance, if you spot a pair of shoes someone is wearing in an Instagram photo, you can screenshot it and use Visual Intelligence to find those shoes (or similar ones) online.\nPhotos tabs are back: For anyone who's still frustrated with the Photos changes made last year, you'll be happy to know that your tabs are coming back. Library and Collections will have their own separate spaces so you don't have to scroll to infinity to find what you're looking for.\nFaceTime \"Communication Safety\" feature: A newer addition to iOS 26 appears to be the FaceTime \"Communication Safety\" feature that pauses communications if and when nudity is detected. The feature appears to be a child safety feature that uses on-device detection, thus obviating any cloud-based privacy issues. \nNew lock screen options: The iPhone lock screen gets more customizable in iOS 26, with a cooler clock, 3D wallpaper effects, more widgets and better focus mode options. \nApple's Hold Assist will be nifty for those pesky services that put you on hold for 10 or more minutes. (Apple)\nNew changes coming to iPadOS 26\nYour iPad isn't getting left behind when it comes to big updates. Here's what's coming this fall.\nMultitasking and real windowing: When you download the newest update, you'll be able to have multiple apps running on your screen at the same time. Once you open an app, it'll appear on your screen as normal but you'll be able to resize and move it across your screen to make room for other apps. This feature is optional so you can turn it off if you don't like it.\nVisual update: Along with the other new OSes, iPadOS 26 is coming with the Liquid Glass aesthetic. This new look will appear on the lock and home screens, as well as the drop-down menus.\nNew menu bar: When you swipe down on your screen, the new menu bar will appear with options like File, Edit, Windows and more. There's also a search option if you're looking for something specific.\nCheckout our first impressions of iPadOS 26. \nWhat about AirPods?\nAirPods are also getting updated with iOS 26. Here are some of the more notable functions.\nEnhanced audio recording: Apple calls this \"studio-quality\" audio recording, and with it, you'll notice more clarity while in noisy environments.\nCamera remote control: Using this, you can take a photo or start and stop video recording with just one press on your AirPods. When taking photos, you'll get a three-second countdown before your iPhone or iPad snaps the picture.\nWhich iPhones will be able to upgrade to iOS 26?\nA few iPhone models that run the current version of iOS — iPhone XR, XS and XS Max — won't be compatible with the latest upgrade. But any iPhones released in 2019 or later will be eligible for the iOS 26 update.\n\niPhone SE (second generation or later)\niPhone 11\niPhone 11 Pro\niPhone 11 Pro Max\niPhone 12\niPhone 12 mini\niPhone 12 Pro\niPhone 12 Pro Max\niPhone 13\niPhone 13 mini\niPhone 13 Pro\niPhone 13 Pro Max\niPhone 14\niPhone 14 Plus\niPhone 14 Pro\niPhone 14 Pro Max\niPhone 15\niPhone 15 Plus\niPhone 15 Pro\niPhone 15 Pro Max\niPhone 16e\niPhone 16\niPhone 16 Plus\niPhone 16 Pro\niPhone 16 Pro Max\n\nNot listed here are the presumed new iPhone 17 models (or maybe iPhone 26?) that are all but certain to be announced and released in September. \nHow to install iOS 26 beta\nThe iOS 26 public beta is now available to download via the Apple Beta Software Program. If you're not already a member, you'll need to sign up to try out all the latest features. Just visit beta.apple.com and sign up with your phone number or email address. It's free.\nOnce you're in, you can install it by going to Settings > General > Software Update and selecting iOS 26 public beta. \nA word of caution: Don't sign up with your main iPhone unless you're OK with any risks that occur with using an OS that isn't finalized.\nWhen will the final version of iOS 26 be released?\niOS 26 will be released to the public this fall. It usually comes in September, within a week of the Apple iPhone event. Last year, it rolled out to iPhone users on September 16 — exactly one week after the iPhone 16 lineup was announced.\nIf you're more interested in the Apple Intelligence features coming, here's everything Apple revealed for iOS, macOS and more during WWDC. Also, check out how iOS 26 screenshots could be an intriguing preview of Apple's delayed Siri rework.\nUpdate, August 11: Noted that iOS 26 developer beta has hit beta 6. \nUpdate, August 8: Added new features coming with iPadOS 26 and AirPods.\nUpdate, August 6: Noted the release of iOS 26 beta 5 and the new bouncy feature on passcode screen and Control Center.\nUpdate, August 4: Noted that Apple is reportedly working on a ChatGPT rival.\nUpdate, August 1: Added quote from Tim Cook about iOS 26.\nUpdate, July 31: Noted that iOS 18.6 is now available. \nUpdate, July 24: Noted the iOS 26 public beta is now available.\nUpdate, July 3: Noted new FaceTime feature found in the developer beta.\nUpdate, June 30: Noted ongoing iOS 18 releases, and reports that Apple is considering additional external LLMs for Siri. \nUpdate, June 25: Noted changes added in iOS 26 beta 2. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/ios-26-and-ipados-26-public-beta-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-new-apple-updates-135749093.html?src=rss",
    "full_text": "In just over a month, we'll finally get to download the official iOS 26 on our iPhones. Called Liquid Glass, the new translucent look will extend across all of Apple's upcoming operating systems. Plus, a treasured feature that we took for granted is coming back (hint: it's in the Photos app). Some or all of those changes will likely soon migrate into the separate public beta (see below). So while iOS and its sibling operating systems will be released in late 2025, they're all designated \"26\" to reflect the year ahead. You'll also notice buttons with a new floating design in several apps, like Phone and Maps. Phone app redesign: You'll finally be able to scroll through contacts, recent calls and voicemail messages all on one screen. Camera remote control: Using this, you can take a photo or start and stop video recording with just one press on your AirPods. When taking photos, you'll get a three-second countdown before your iPhone or iPad snaps the picture. Also, check out how iOS 26 screenshots could be an intriguing preview of Apple's delayed Siri rework."

    "summary": "The latest example of bias permeating artificial intelligence comes from the medical field. A new study surveyed real case notes from 617 adult social care workers in the UK and found that when large language models summarized the notes, they were more likely to omit language such as \"disabled,\" \"unable\" or \"complex\" when the patient was tagged as female, which could lead to women receiving insufficient or inaccurate medical care.\nResearch led by the London School of Economics and Political Science ran the same case notes through two LLMs — Meta's Llama 3 and Google's Gemma — and swapped the patient's gender, and the AI tools often provided two very different patient snapshots. While Llama 3 showed no gender-based differences across the surveyed metrics, Gemma had significant examples of this bias. Google's AI summaries produced disparities as drastic as \"Mr Smith is an 84-year-old man who lives alone and has a complex medical history, no care package and poor mobility\" for a male patient, while the same case notes with credited to a female patient provided: \"Mrs Smith is an 84-year-old living alone. Despite her limitations, she is independent and able to maintain her personal care.\" \nRecent research has uncovered biases against women in the medical sector, both in clinical research and in patient diagnosis. The stats also trend worse for racial and ethnic minorities and for the LGBTQ community. It's the latest stark reminder that LLMs are only as good as the information they are trained on and the people deciding how they are trained. The particularly concerning takeaway from this research was that UK authorities have been using LLMs in care practices, but without always detailing which models are being introduced or in what capacity.\n\"We know these models are being used very widely and what’s concerning is that we found very meaningful differences between measures of bias in different models,” lead author Dr. Sam Rickman said, noting that the Google model was particularly likely to dismiss mental and physical health issues for women. \"Because the amount of care you get is determined on the basis of perceived need, this could result in women receiving less care if biased models are used in practice.

This contract begins in 2026 and covers the organization's full slate of 13 marquee bouts and 30 Fight Night events per year. All matches and events will stream in the US on Paramount+ and select fights will simulcast on CBS.\nThis ends the pay-per-view (PPV) model that ESPN+ has favored for premium UFC events. \"What’s on pay-per-view anymore? Boxing? Movies on DirecTV? It’s an outdated, antiquated model,\" said Mark Shapiro, president of UFC's parent company TKO Group. Matches take place throughout the year, which isn't true of other sports. This should keep the UFC's massive fanbase tethered to that Paramount+ subscription.\nThis happened just a few days after Skydance Media officially acquired Paramount and its subsidiaries for $8 billion. It's fairly wild that Skydance paid $8 billion to own Paramount and its various IPs in perpetuity and $7.7 billion to air UFC fights in one country for seven years.\n“UFC is a unicorn asset that comes up about once a decade,” said TKO Group CEO David Ellison. Paramount is also interested in purchasing the international rights to air UFC matches and it's being given an exclusive negotiation window with each country to do just that.\nBreaking News 🚨UFC has a new home in 2026 only on @paramountplus pic.twitter.com/FUQjemPnBS— danawhite (@danawhite) August 11, 2025\n\nIt's been reported that Paramount likely placated Trump in several ways to ensure the FCC approved the acquisition. The company coughed up $16 million to settle a \"frivolous and dangerous\" lawsuit with Trump after 60 Minutes interviewed Kamala Harris and cut an answer for time, which is something televised interviews have always done. Paramount will allocate that money to Trump's future presidential library and did not provide a \"statement of apology or regret.\"\n\nCBS, which is owned by Paramount, also canceled The Late Show With Stephen Colbert, which was seen by many as a move to pacify Trump. The president denies this, saying the cancellation was due to a \"pure lack of talent.\"\nParamount has promised to end all US-based Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) programs and to hire a bias monitor for CBS News to make sure that conservative voices aren't drowned out by the constant drumbeat of reality.

This ends the pay-per-view (PPV) model that ESPN+ has favored for premium UFC events. Matches take place throughout the year, which isn't true of other sports. This should keep the UFC's massive fanbase tethered to that Paramount+ subscription. This happened just a few days after Skydance Media officially acquired Paramount and its subsidiaries for $8 billion. It's fairly wild that Skydance paid $8 billion to own Paramount and its various IPs in perpetuity and $7.7 billion to air UFC fights in one country for seven years. Paramount is also interested in purchasing the international rights to air UFC matches and it's being given an exclusive negotiation window with each country to do just that.

    "summary": "It goes without saying that Apple devices tend to be fairly high-quality — the company's gear currently occupies the top spots in several of our buying guides, from laptops and tablets to smartphones and smartwatches. As a result, that gear usually doesn't come cheap. But that doesn’t mean you always have to pay full price. Good Apple deals are often out there, so long as you know where to look.To make things easier, we're keeping a running list of the best Apple deals you can shop right now on AirPods, MacBooks, iPads and more. Just note that you’ll almost always find the best Apple deals from third-party retailers like Amazon, Best Buy, Walmart, Target and the like, not from Apple's own online store. Unless you shop refurbished, you’ll usually pay top dollar buying direct (though for some items like iPhones, that might be the best route to take).\nBest iPad deals\n \nApple iPad Air (13-inch, M3) for $649 ($150 off): Engadget's Nathan Ingraham gave the 13-inch iPad Air a score of 89 when it was released in March. It has a bigger and slightly brighter display than its 11-inch counterpart; otherwise, the two slates are the same. If you plan to keep your iPad hooked up to a keyboard, the extra screen space is lovely for taking in movies and multitasking for work. This is another new low, and again, all color and storage configs are on sale. \nApple iPad Pro (13-inch, M4) for $1,099 ($200 off): The most powerful iPad is the iPad Pro. Both the 11- and 13-inch models have gorgeous 120Hz OLED displays, thinner and lighter designs, a repositioned front camera and the excessively powerful M4 chip inside. This 13-inch version is pricey, but it may be worth the extra cost if you plan to multitask regularly or just want more screen space for enjoying movies. While this isn't the absolute largest discount we've seen, it's a solid drop all the same. Be aware, though, that reports have said that Apple could release a new iPad Pro by the end of the year. Also at Target and Best Buy.\nApple iPad mini (A17 Pro) for $399 ($100 off): The iPad mini is exactly what it sounds like: the smaller iPad. This latest iteration has an improved A17 Pro chip — which is enough to support Apple Intelligence — along with 128GB of storage in the base model and Apple Pencil Pro support. As before, you’d buy it if you value the smaller 8.3-inch display and want a tablet you can more easily hold with one hand. This deal is $20 more than the lowest price we've tracked. Also at Target and Best Buy.\nBest MacBook deals\n \nApple MacBook Air (15-inch, M4) for $999 ($200 off): The 15-inch MacBook Air is nearly identical to the smaller version but features more robust speakers and a more spacious trackpad alongside its roomier display. $999 is the lowest price we've tracked.\nApple MacBook Air (15-inch, M3, 24GB RAM) for $1,199 ($500 off): The last-gen M3 MacBook Air has officially been discontinued, but it remains a superb laptop while stock remains available. We gave this 15-inch model a score of 90 in our review — outside of its slower chip (which is still plenty fast for everyday use), marginally improved camera and inability to power two external displays with the lid open, it's virtually identical to the newer version. This deal applies to the model with the larger 24GB of memory in the Starlight colorway.\nBest AirPods deals\n \nApple AirPods Pro 2 for $169 ($80 off): The AirPods Pro 2 are Apple’s best set of wireless earbuds for now, as they offer the full set of Apple-focused features, strong ANC, onboard volume controls, a comfy in-ear design and a warm sound profile that most should find agreeable. They can even work as a hearing aid, though their six-hour battery life still isn’t the best, and you should only get them if you’re all-in on Apple hardware. But if that’s the case, we consider them the best wireless earbuds for iPhone owners. This deal is $20 off the all-time low we saw last month, but it's still a ways below the set's usual going rate. Also at Walmart and Best Buy. Exercise caution, though: If you're not in a rush, this is another Apple device that may see a refresh within the next couple of months.\nBest Apple Watch deals\n \nApple Watch Ultra 2 for $650 ($149 off): Apple’s most premium smartwatch, the Ultra 2 has a killer 36-hour battery life, a handy Low Power mode for extended use and cellular connectivity by default. It also has a compass app, water temperature gauge and a loud onboard siren that you can trigger in emergencies. This discount marks the lowest price we've tracked. But again, we wouldn't be surprised if Apple introduced an updated model in the coming weeks.\nApple Watch SE (GPS, 40mm) for $169 ($80 off): As with the more premium models, we wouldn’t be surprised to see an update to Apple’s budget smartwatch sometime soon (and we have a few suggestions on the matter). But thanks to some serious discounts, the Apple Watch SE has turned out to be the most affordable way to get an iPhone companion for your wrist. Despite a lackluster screen and limited extra features, it handles the basics well. Also at Target.\nBest Apple accessories deals\n \nApple Pencil (USB-C) for $69 ($10 off): This more affordable Apple Pencil doesn’t support pressure sensitivity, but it still makes for a useful stylus for the basics. If you’re a casual note-taker and can live without wireless charging, you’ll save a few bucks by picking this one up. Also at Walmart and Best Buy.\nRead more Apple coverage:\n\nThe best AirPods\nThe best Apple Watches\nThe best MacBooks\nThe best iPhones\nThe best iPads\n\nFollow @EngadgetDeals on X for the latest tech deals and buying advice.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/best-apple-deals-150020110.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Unlike two of its biggest rivals, Sony waited until April to unveil its latest soundbars rather than debut them at CES in January. And even then, the two most premium options in the company’s 2025 lineup remain untouched. Instead, Sony gave us the Bravia Theater Bar 6 ($650): a 3.1.2-channel Dolby Atmos soundbar that comes with a wireless subwoofer and a modest set of features. However, the caveats here are real headscratchers, especially on a soundbar launching this year.\n \nWhat’s good about the Bravia Theater Bar 6?\nOverall sound quality has never been an issue on the Sony soundbars I’ve tested, and the Theater Bar 6 continues with that trend. You can expect crisp, warm sound with excellent clarity and solid directional audio. Even over Bluetooth, this speaker-sub combo is great for music, doing justice to the subtle details of Miles Davis’ Mies ‘54: The Prestige Recordings. Classic jazz is a great way to judge a speaker’s merits, and on the Bar 6, this recently remastered album is dynamic and inviting throughout all 20 tracks. \nThe soundbar also delivered great audio in movies and TV. I was sucked into battle scenes during the second season of Andor, even though the limitations of the Theater Bar 6’s 3.1.2-channel configuration quickly became apparent. Its five-driver arrangement does well, thanks to three front-firing units and two angled up-firing speakers. Those latter two components really help with filling the overhead space during the action in shows like Andor, compensating for the limited number of drivers (and their positioning) as much as possible. And all of that makes the Theater Bar 6 a solid option for smaller spaces, especially if you have lower ceilings and won’t be sitting far from the TV.\nThe Theater Bar 6 won’t win any design awards, but that’s okay. There are plenty of people, myself included, who don’t really want their soundbar to stand out on the TV stand or mantle. The focus should be the display, not the speaker. This model is quite plain, but it also has a relatively low profile, so even if your TV has a short stand, the Theater Bar 6 won’t block the picture.\nWhat’s not so great about the Bravia Theater Bar 6?\n\n\n\n\n   Billy Steele for Engadget \n \n\nThe first strike against the Bravia Theater Bar 6 is the lack of Wi-Fi connectivity. If you want a wireless connection to the soundbar, Bluetooth is your only option. What’s more, no Wi-Fi means no AirPlay, Chromecast or Spotify Connect — all of which should be standard on a $650 model in 2025. Sony did make it easy to switch from the HDMI input over to Bluetooth in the Bravia Connect app, and that change happens quickly after you’ve paired your phone with the soundbar once.\nSpeaking of the app, it doesn’t actually help you install firmware updates to the Theater Bar 6. Instead, it prompts you to transfer the files from a computer to a thumb drive to get them to the soundbar. Yes, really. Sony says the lack of Wi-Fi is why this workaround is required. No matter the reason, having to dig a thumb drive out of your junk drawer to install updates is a big inconvenience, and it shouldn’t really be a thing in the mid 2020s.\nIn the sound department, the only real knock against the Theater Bar 6 is more about the constraints of 3.1.2-channel audio. Even with Dolby Atmos and DTS:X content, this system will be limited in its abilities to deliver immersive sound. Sure, Sony’s S-Fore Pro and Vertical Surround Engine do well to virtualize a more robust living room setup, but that tech only goes so far.\nYou might think a pair of rear speakers would bolster the sound, and Sony does offer the Bravia Theater System 6 ($770) as a 5.1-channel all-in-one package. However, it doesn’t include the Theater Bar 6 and its subwoofer. Instead, that bundle comes with a different soundbar that doesn’t have up-firing drivers, which means it might lack overhead sound and dampen the impact of immersive content. Unfortunately, if you want to add rear speakers to the Theater Bar 6, you’re out of luck. None of Sony’s currently available options are compatible with this soundbar.\nLastly, and this isn’t a huge issue for most people, but the Theater Bar 6’s included subwoofer is big. Bigger than most of the competition? No, but it’s large nonetheless. I’ll admit I’ve been spoiled by the QS700F that I recently reviewed, thanks to its subwoofer’s compact design. But if speakers in this category start trending smaller, the one that accompanies the Bar 6 will definitely end up being one of the chunkier models.\nWrap-up\n\n\n\n   The up-firing speakers assist with Dolby Atmos.  \n \n\n   Billy Steele for Engadget \n \n\nFrom a pure sound quality standpoint, the Theater Bar 6 excels at both its music and TV duties. Sure, it’s limited by its 3.1.2-channel configuration, but there’s a definite use case for that type of setup — especially if you’re short on living room space. The audio is crisp and clear, and it’s also warm and inviting, which makes this soundbar well-suited for all kinds of content.\nDespite my heaping on all of that praise, the Bar 6 simply has too many drawbacks that I can’t overlook. The lack of Wi-Fi on a $650 soundbar is absurd, mostly because it strips users of the convenience of AirPlay, Chromecast and other wireless connection options. I also can’t get over the need to use a thumb drive for updates when OTA downloads for new firmware have been the norm on soundbars for years.\nFor those reasons, the Samsung QS700F is the better option in this price range since it combines great sound with an orientation feature that automatically recofigures the output direction based on placement. Sony and Samsung are in a tight race in regards to audio performance with the Theater Bar 6 and the QS700F, but only one of those 2025 soundbars will save you from some headaches.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/sony-bravia-theater-bar-6-review-great-sound-greater-frustration-144512450.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Despite the impending loss of federal rebates, Ford plans to give US EV production a huge boost. After hyping it last week as a \"breakthrough\" and \"Model T moment,\" the company has announced the Ford Universal EV Platform to be shared by a new family of products. The first of those will be a midsized pickup with a starting price of around $30,000, likely similar in configuration to the popular Maverick. It will use the company's upcoming prismatic LFP (lithium iron phosphate) batteries. \nFord will invest $5 billion, including $2 billion at its Louisville, Kentucky factory on top of $3 billion already announced for its BlueOval battery plant. It will expand the Louisville facility by 52,000 square feet and \"create or secure\" nearly 4,000 direct jobs, Ford added. \nFord's only two EVs right now are the F-150 Lightning and Mustang Mach-E, both of which use one-off platforms. With the Universal EV Platform, Ford will be able to build multiple vehicles including vans, cars and pickups that should be easier to build and thus cheaper. \"The result: a simple, efficient, flexible ecosystem to deliver a family of affordable, electric, software-defined vehicles,\" the company said. \nFord said that the platform will reduce parts by 20 percent versus a typical vehicle, with fewer fasteners and workstations and a 15 percent quicker assembly time. The company is also promising a lower cost of ownership over five years \"than a three-year-old used Tesla Model Y.\" \nFord\nThe company also touted its LFP prismatic batteries as enabling space and weight savings along with cost reductions, due to the cobalt-free and nickel-free composition. However, the company's choice of LFP for its next-gen EVs has not been without controversy. Since Ford is licensing tech from China's CATL, it may lose out on tax credits of up to $700 million if Congress passes a bill banning federal support for battery plants that use tech or materials from China. \nThe first vehicle will be a mid-sized four-door electric pickup set to launch in 2027. Ford hasn't yet revealed the name or shown a photo, but it will supposedly have more room than Toyota's latest RAV4 without even counting the frunk and truck bed. Buyers will be able to lock gear like bikes or surfboards into that bed, eliminating the need for roof or trailer hitch racks. It will have a low center of gravity from the battery, instant torque and a 0 to 60 mph time \"as fast as a Mustang EcoBoost [around 4.5 seconds], with more downforce,\" Ford said.\nFord hasn't detailed other vehicles that will be built on the platform, but an animation shows a variety ranging from utility vans to crossovers to SUVs to sedans, along with the aforementioned pickup. One rumor states that the new pickup could be called the Ranchero (based on a trademark filing) or it may use the Ranger name. In any case, it's clearly a big deal for Ford, since the company will have no less than three announcements for it. More info for the midsized electric truck, including reveal date, starting price, battery range and charge times \"will be communicated later,\" Ford simply said. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/ford-is-developing-a-30000-midsized-ev-pickup-143030877.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "If you've put off getting a new MacBook then today is your lucky day. Right now, the 2025 13- and 15-inch MacBook Air M4 are available on Amazon for record-low prices. The 13-inch model is our pick for best MacBook to buy this year.\nYou can pick up the 13-inch MacBook Air M4 for $799, down from $999 — a 20 percent discount. This model comes with 16GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD. You can upgrade to 512GB SSD for $999, down from $1,199, another all-time low price, or 24GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD for $1,199, down from $1,399. \n \nThen there's the 15-inch MacBook Air M4, whose cheapest model is on sale for $999, dropping from $1,199. The 17 percent discount is the best deal we've seen since the pair debuted in March. As with the 13-inch model, the 16GB and 512GB SSD option is also a record-low price, dropping to $1,199 from $1,399. Then there's the 24GB upgrade, which is $1,399, down from $1,599.\nWe're big fans of the MacBook Air M4, giving it a 92 in our review. Part of that comes from an already lower starting price for the MacBooks than their predecessors. The 2025 models also get a speed boost thanks to the M4 chip and are very thin with a 0.44-inch thickness. Neither the 13- or 15-inch will drag you down, weighing 2.7 pounds and 3.2 pounds, respectively. Plus, they both have excellent battery life, lasting over 18 hours while playing an HD video. \nThe big differences in the 15-inch model mostly come down to size. The screen is obviously bigger, as is its trackpad. Other than that, it offers better speakers than its 13-inch sibling. \n \nCheck out our coverage of the best Apple deals for more discounts, and follow @EngadgetDeals on X for the latest tech deals and buying advice.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/macbook-air-deal-get-the-m4-powered-laptop-for-a-record-low-price-123031593.html?src=rss",

That’s a not-insignificant 32 percent off the usual $249 price of the noise-canceling in-ears.\nApple’s flagship AirPods were $100 off — a record-low $149 — during Prime Day, so we have seen them even cheaper than this, but for a non-sale period, Amazon’s current deal is worth considering. The AirPods Pro 2 are our top choice for iPhone users looking for wireless earbuds, thanks to much beefier sound than the original model, rock solid ANC and transparency modes, and seamless switching between Apple devices. \n \nThrow in spatial audio support, hands-free Siri and more than acceptable battery life, and the AirPods Pro 2 are hard to top. Not everyone gets on with the sometimes fiddly touch gestures, but a lot of wireless headphones struggle with this. If there’s anything to give you pause, it’s that we might be getting the AirPods Pro 3 sooner rather than later. But if that’s the case, you can be confident you’ll pay a lot more than $169 for the privilege.\nThe AirPods Pro aren’t the only discounted AirPods right now. The AirPods 4 (without ANC) are down to $99. Usually priced at $129, you’re saving $30 on a much improved entry-level AirPods offering. They fit and sound better than any non-Pro AirPods before them, and inherit some previously Pro-only features thanks to the H2 chip. If you travel a lot you’ll also certainly rue the lack of ANC, but if that isn’t a deal breaker for you, the $99 price point might be tempting.\n \nCheck out our coverage of the best Apple deals for more discounts, and follow @EngadgetDeals on X for the latest tech deals and buying advice.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/apples-airpods-pro-2-are-back-on-sale-for-169-142401799.html?src=rss",

It previously developed the A800 and H800 chips for the Chinese market, but those were also banned. \nNow, NVIDIA and AMP were both reportedly granted export licenses for China last week, after agreeing to give the government 15 percent of their profits.

At the end of July, 20 national security experts and past government officials — including President Trump's former deputy national security advisor, Matt Pottinger — wrote a letter to Howard Lutnick, the US Secretary of Commerce, stating as much. \nThe signatories \"believe this move represents a strategic misstep that endangers the United States’ economic and military edge in artificial intelligence.\" They worry it will restrict the number of chips available for the US and be used by China's military, among other concerns.

If the student in your life likes to work from the library or a coffee shop often, there’s a good chance they’ve had to do the charging dance, choosing which device is most crucial to them at the moment and giving it the prime spot on the wall. A surge protector power strip like this one from Anker can eliminate that problem by giving them eight AC outlets to use simultaneously, along with two USb-A ports and one USB-C connector. They’ll be able to charge up their laptop and phone at the same time, and have plenty of extra options if they also need to power a portable monitor or a tablet, or recharge a pair of headphones before they head home for the day. The USB-C port on this device also supports 20W fast-charging, which will be useful when they need to top up a dying smartphone. And with this power strip measuring just 4.5-inches by 3.6-inches, it’s compact enough to live in their backpack."

    "full_text": "Mario Kart is a proven formula, and Nintendo has done more than enough to make MKW the kind of game that millions of people will play over the next decade or so. There are a ton of cleverly-designed new tracks that you can pick up and play immediately — but the more time you put into them, the more shortcuts and secrets you’ll find to help master them. There’s a truckload of Nintendo characters to pilot your kart or bike, from the heavy hitters to bizarre but amusing choices like a Piranha plant. But while Mario Kart World will feel familiar to the millions who played Mario Kart 8, it also introduces a few noteworthy new features. One is that the majority of courses don’t have you doing three laps around a track — instead, you’re driving from point A to point B, with every track being set in a part of a larger world (hence the name). You can cruise from one side of the map to the other, looking for little bonus challenges, unlocking more outfits for your characters and finding other collectibles. The fact that you can’t cruise around free roam in multiplayer mode is a major bummer, and the world itself feels somewhat deserted as a result, but there’s still a ton to do here. This is probably my favorite part — it’s an ongoing race across six courses with five checkpoints along the way. At each checkpoint, you have to be higher than a certain ranking or you’ll be eliminated. While I wish Nintendo took just a few more risks with Mario Kart World, it’s the kind of game anyone can pick up and have a blast with."
