    "summary": "Google has launched Flight Deals as its AI tool within Google Flights to help travelers find cheaper fares.",
    "full_text": "Google on Thursday announced a new AI-powered search tool to help travelers find flight deals — even as regulators continue to question whether the search giant’s dominance in travel discovery stifles competition. Users can type natural language queries into a search bar — describing how and when they want to travel — and the AI surfaces matching options. These queries can be like “week-long trip this winter to a city with great food, nonstop only” or “10-day ski trip to a world-class resort with fresh powder,” Google said in a blog post. Regulators, including the European Commission, are currently investigating how Google may be favoring its own search products — including Google Flights — in ways that harm competition. In response, the Alphabet-owned unit is reportedly planning to propose changes to appease regulators, including the addition of a price-comparison box in search results. Google did not immediately respond to questions about which Gemini models power the tool, what data sources are used, or what privacy safeguards are in place. In that sense, Google is arriving a bit late. But with its scale and reach, the company could still pose a serious challenge — if the tool proves effective and gains traction. Nonetheless, the classic Google Flights interface will continue to exist. The original flight search tool, launched in 2011, is even getting an update with an option to exclude basic economy fares for trips within the U.S. and Canada."

    "full_text": "If you want a convenient way to stay well read without amassing a library of physical books, an e-reader may be the right solution. The Boox Palma 2 impressed us with its pocket-friendly size and ability to run Android apps. Verge Editor-at-Large David Pierce liked the Palma 2 because it allowed him to read, take notes, and listen to music or podcasts without using his smartphone. The device’s shape makes it easier to hold one handed or keep in a pocket than a Kindle or Kobo. Despite its size, we found the Palma 2 could last between four or five days per charge. The Palma 2 has 128GB of storage, which is sufficient for holding hundreds of ebooks, but you could eat it up quickly by loading the device with apps from Google’s Play Store. You can also play audio through the Palma 2’s built-in speaker. The device even has a 16-megapixel camera, though in our tests it was best used for scanning documents and QR codes rather than taking photos. If you want an e-reader that’s convenient to grab before you head out the door each morning, Boox’s Palma 2 is the only one that may reasonably fit in your pocket. It’s also more capable thanks to its ability to access Google Play Store, though the limits of an E Ink display may curb your desire to download social media apps or other distractions that can keep you from finally finishing War & Peace."

    "full_text": "is a senior reviewer focused on smart home and connected tech, with over twenty years of experience. Details are scarce, but the description mentions “built-in MotionAware technology.” Wi-Fi motion sensing technology has been around for years — Hue’s sister company Wiz uses it in its Wi-Fi bulbs — but Hue lights work over Zigbee, not Wi-Fi. In January, a company called Ivani debuted its Sensify wireless sensing technology, which can turn mains-powered Zigbee devices (like light bulbs) into motion sensors with a firmware update. According to additional reporting by HueBlog, the Bridge Pro will feature a faster processor, more RAM, the addition of Wi-Fi connectivity so you don’t have to plug it into your router, and support for up to 150 bulbs and 50 accessories — more than triple the current bridge’s capability. Another confirmed rumor: Hue lights will soon be controlled by Sonos’ voice assistant. While Sonos Voice Control is more limited than Alexa or Siri, all commands are processed locally. The new flagship Hue A19 bulb features better energy efficiency and deeper dimming alongside improved color synching. It supports Hue’s ChromaSync tech for more precise color matching when syncing across fixtures — a feature also coming to a new “family of indoor and outdoor light strips” with gradient lighting. Two new Festavia-branded outdoor lights are on the way: a set of permanent outdoor lights designed to be fixed to the outside of your house, similar to those offered by Govee and Nanoleaf, and a set of Globe String lights. I’ll be in Berlin next month for IFA to see the official launch and get hands-on with these new products."

    "summary": "Q: I'm hearing that Microsoft is pulling the plug on Windows 10 later this year. What does that mean for my current Windows 10 PC, and what are my options?\nA: Microsoft will officially end support for Windows 10 on October 14, 2025, a little over 10 years after the operating system was released. While you can continue to use Windows 10 PCs after that date — and it's understandable why, I gave it a glowing review at launch — you'll no longer receive any customer support, security updates or any other sort of upgrades. Windows 10 will effectively become a zombie operating system, shuffling along until some sort of malware or massive security breach renders it far too insecure. (Think about it this way: Would you actually feel safe running Windows XP, a notoriously malware-prone OS that hasn't received a significant security update since 2019, today? I would hope not!)\nSo what's a Windows 10 user to do? Let's consider your choices.\nThe best option: Upgrade to Windows 11\nFor most users, the simplest way to move on from Windows 10 is to step up to Microsoft's new OS. Windows 11 is a free upgrade for Windows 10 users running the latest 22HS update and who also meet the minimum hardware specifications. Microsoft isn't asking for much — just a 1 GHz dual-core 64-bit processor, 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage -— but security requirements may be a problem for very old PCs. Those include the ability to launch in Secure Boot mode, as well as having a TPM 2.0 (Trusted Platform 2.0) module. Windows 11 relies on the latter for biometric logins, BitLocker data encryption and other security features. If you don't have TPM 2.0, you'll be stuck with Windows 10 until you get a new PC.\nIf that all sounds too complicated, Microsoft's PC Health Check app can also let you know if your system is ready for Windows 11. And if you've been bombarded by Windows 11 upgrade notifications over the past few years, that's also a not-so-subtle nudge that your PC is likely ready for the new OS. (There are various hacks that can let you install Windows 11 without TPM 2.0 and Secure Boot, but they’re risky and could make your OS installation vulnerable.)\nIf you do choose to upgrade, you can expect a relatively painless process. Gone are the days when a Windows upgrade could easily wipe out your entire system. Now you can expect all of your software (and their respective licenses) to carry over, but with yet another caveat for Office suites: Microsoft is also ending support for Office 2016 and Office 2019 on October 14, 2025 as well. Cloud-based Microsoft 365 apps should be good to go on Windows 11 as well (see below for Windows 10 limitations).  \nAssuming you've got enough hard drive space to hold the new OS, the upgrade process is merely a matter of sitting back and watching your system reboot a few times. I'd still recommend backing up any essential data before upgrading, though, just in case you run into any issues. (Pairing a cloud-based Microsoft OneDrive backup with a local hard disk is a good belt and suspenders solution.)\n\nThe pricey option: Buy a new PC\nIf your system is too old to support Secure Boot mode and TPM 2.0, it’s probably just time for an upgrade. (Expert users can find workarounds on YouTube and elsewhere, but you need to be adventurous enough to handle the likes of Github downloads and security overrides.) Luckily, we’ve got a slew of buying guides to help you out. Be sure to check out our best laptop guide, which includes some tips on the best specs to seek out, as well as some of our favorite systems like the Dell 14 Premium and MacBook Air (because it’s also a good time to consider switching from Windows to Macs). \nOur best Windows laptops guide also highlights systems like the ASUS ZenBook S14 and the Surface Pro Copilot+ tablet. While the sweetspot for new PCs tends to be in the $750 to $1,200 range, with current back-to-school promos, you can find very capable laptops and desktops for as low as $500, and occasionally less. But if you're looking for something higher end ($1,400 and up), our best gaming laptop guide would be helpful. \nThe risky option: Keep on trucking with Windows 10\nWindows 10 won't self-destruct when its support ends, so you could conceivably just use your older PC until it dies. But that's a risky option since you won't be getting any security updates. All it takes is for one intrepid hacker to find a new security flaw and you could easily fall victim to any number of issues. That includes getting malware, which could slow down performance and leak your data to hackers, or falling victim to a ransomware data theft scheme. And every day past October 14 just raises the likelihood of OS-level vulnerabilities that third-party antivirus software would be ill-equipped to fight off. Trust me – you don't want to do this. At the very least, buy yourself another year to figure things out\nThe procrastinator option: Extend Windows 10's security updates for one year \nIf your hardware can't support the move to Windows 11, you can at least hit the snooze button by subscribing to the Windows 10 extended update (ESU) program. While it was initially announced as a $30 offering, Microsoft has since made it a free option if you synchronize your Windows 10 settings to the cloud via Windows Backup, or you could shell out 1,000 Microsoft reward points. \nAs its name implies, the ESU will get you Windows 10 security updates, bug fixes and technical support until October 13, 2026. It also extends support for cloud-based Microsoft 365 apps through August 2026 for individuals and families. Sure, it's only a year of additional support, but that can at least buy you enough time to do more research on a new PC, or wait for a holiday sale. For what it's worth, this marks the first time Microsoft has offered any sort of ESU to consumers. Typically, they're just a way for corporate IT admins to get additional support without migrating to a new OS.\nHave a tech question you’d like Engadget to answer?\nAs tech reporters, the Engadget staff is always answering questions from friends and family about electronics, software, gaming, big tech policies and more. So we decided to write down our answers. This question is a composite of ones we’ve been asked recently. If you’ve got a tech-related question you’d like us to answer for you, please email ask@engadget.com.\nUpdate 8/14/25, 10:20AM ET:  Added more information regarding a free option to receive the Windows 10 ESU, and more details about software licenses carrying over into Windows 11.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/ask-engadget-what-are-my-options-when-windows-10-support-ends-on-october-14-160534495.html?src=rss",

    "full_text": "While being interviewed on Decoder, ChatGPT head Nick Turley said he’s “humble enough not to rule it out categorically,” but hedged that OpenAI would need to “be very thoughtful and tasteful” about how ads could be integrated into ChatGPT. “We will build other products, and those other products can have different dimensions to them, and maybe ChatGPT just isn’t an ads-y product because it’s just so deeply accountable to your goals. “I think it’s good to preserve optionality, but I also really do want to emphasize how incredible the subscription model is, how fast it’s growing, and how untapped a lot of the opportunities are.” Turley says that ChatGPT just surpassed 700 million total users. “I really think it’s a funnel that we can build off of to build differentiated offerings for people who are willing to pay.” OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has expressed mixed feelings about bringing ads to the company’s flagship chatbot. While at a fireside chat at Harvard Business School last year, Altman said that merging ads with AI is “sort of uniquely unsettling to me” and would be considered a “last resort” for ChatGPT. On the first episode of OpenAI’s podcast in June, however, Altman said he’s “not totally against it.” These considerations come as Elon Musk-owned rival xAI has firmer plans to include ads in Grok’s responses in the future. Turley says this is “something we are actively exploring with some of the merchants we’re talking to,” and that the project is called “Commerce in ChatGPT.” Not allowing affiliate revenue to influence ChatGPT product recommendations is a focus for OpenAI, according to Turley. “I think the magic of ChatGPT is that it independently chooses your products without any interference, and that would be an important thing to preserve.”"

As an experiment, Mahadevan says he set Breitbart News Network as a source using the Google Search feature, saying he chose the far-right news source because it has been known to share misinformation. \"So this concerns me also from a media literacy standpoint because I think it might further push people into echo chambers,\" where they only see beliefs that correspond with those they already hold. \"It just seems like a way for people to narrow down their news diet even more via Google Search,\" Mahadevan said. \"I don't know if we're quite there yet.\""

Thursday marks the surprise reintroduction of the Apple Watch blood oxygen feature, redesigned for some Apple Watch Series 9, Series 10 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 owners. The feature will be available via a software update that's rolling out now. If you own one of these models and don't currently have access to the feature, you'll need to ensure your paired iPhone is updated to iOS 18.6.1 and that your Apple Watch is currently running watchOS 11.6.1. The updates will trigger sensor data collected from the Blood Oxygen app on your Apple Watch to be measured and calculated on your iPhone. The update was enabled by a recent US Customs ruling, the company noted in a blog post. Apple had previously been forced to disable Blood Oxygen monitoring in models shipped after January 2024. This was due to an import ban sparked by a patent dispute between Apple and a company called Masimo. By shifting the measurement and calculation of blood oxygen levels from the Apple Watch to the iPhone, Apple has managed to circumvent the ban. \"Apple's teams work tirelessly to create products and services that empower users with industry-leading health, wellness, and safety features that are grounded in science and have privacy at the core,\" Apple said."

And even though Cohere has fewer resources than Meta, Pineau said she’ll be more agile in her new role. Cohere’s latest product is an AI agent platform dubbed North that enterprises and government agencies can deploy privately on their own infrastructure, an attractive notion for many of its customers, which are banks and federal organizations that handle highly sensitive data. Cohere is betting that by offering more support around its private deployments, it can beat out open models. Pineau said she’s particularly interested in gearing more of Cohere’s research around North, figuring out ways to develop AI agents in private and secure settings, and creating benchmarks to evaluate these systems. But Pineau sees this as an opportunity to “bring in a lot of talent,” noting that when she left Meta, several of her former colleagues suggested they’d follow her to a new AI lab. Of course, Meta’s AI units today look very different compared with when Pineau was there just a few months ago."

Why you don’t want to miss it Aaron Levie helped define cloud collaboration before it was a trend, and he’s still setting the bar. This fireside chat will go deep on what it takes to build something that lasts — not just in terms of product, but also culture, strategy, and mindset.

I’ve never ever worked on a product where the vast majority of its value is empirical in nature. It’s like when you go to the Instant Pot community online, where all these recipes are there. Again, and it’s mostly because I want to run toward the use cases where that matters. We would rarely have a high-confidence target that is further than six months out just because everything changes constantly.

Once Apple begins rolling out the software, you'll need to update your devices to iOS 18.6.1 and watchOS 11.6.1 to access the reworked feature.

In 2021, the medical device maker sued Apple, alleging the tech giant had infringed on its intellectual properties related to pulse oximeter blood-oxygen monitoring technology. Following a couple of years of legal back and forth, the issue came to a head when the US International Trade Commission (ITC) upheld a prior ruling that found Apple had violated Masimo's patents. After former President Biden chose not to veto the decision, Apple was forced to temporarily pause sales of the Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2. The company later started selling the wearables again following an update the removed the infringing blood oxygen monitoring feature. Now Apple says it's able to offer the functionality again, with a slight modification, due to a recent US Customs ruling.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wearables/apples-redesigned-blood-oxygen-monitoring-feature-hits-apple-watches-in-the-us-today-131558485.html?src=rss",
    "full_text": "More than a year after an import ban forced the company to remove blood oxygen monitoring from some US Apple Watch models, Apple says it will introduce a redesigned version of the feature later today. In a post on its newsroom website, the company says the feature will roll out to Apple Watch Series 9, Series 10, and Watch Ultra 2 users through a joint Apple Watch and iPhone update. Once Apple begins rolling out the software, you'll need to update your devices to iOS 18.6.1 and watchOS 11.6.1 to access the reworked feature. Following the update, any blood oxygen data captured by your Apple Watch will be calculated on your iPhone, with the resulting data viewable in the respiratory section of the Health app. \"There will be no impact to Apple Watch units previously purchased that include the original Blood Oxygen feature, nor to Apple Watch units purchased outside of the US,\" Apple said. Today's update marks another unexpected development in Apple's long, drawn out legal feud with Masimo. In 2021, the medical device maker sued Apple, alleging the tech giant had infringed on its intellectual properties related to pulse oximeter blood-oxygen monitoring technology. Following a couple of years of legal back and forth, the issue came to a head when the US International Trade Commission (ITC) upheld a prior ruling that found Apple had violated Masimo's patents. After former President Biden chose not to veto the decision, Apple was forced to temporarily pause sales of the Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2. Now Apple says it's able to offer the functionality again, with a slight modification, due to a recent US Customs ruling."

    "summary": "If DJI is entering the 360-degree action camera market, why shouldn't Insta360 venture into drones? That was my immediate thought when the company announced its first drone, the A1, from a spin-off brand and team called Antigravity.\nSo, what is the A1? Is it an entry-level device? A camera for creators looking to spice up their videos without years of practice? A competitive POV drone? It’s a bit of all three, but the Antigravity A1 isn’t just a drone. It will eventually launch in a three-part set: the flying unit, OLED Vision goggles and a dedicated Grip motion controller.\nIn its current form, the Antigravity A1 weighs around 249 grams (8.8 ounces), which helps it duck around drone license requirements in most regions. (As it’s a preproduction model, this could change a little before it hits retail.) Two ultrawide cameras are positioned on the roof and underside of the drone instead of on the front. It’s like the Insta360 X5 camera is some sort of cocoon for the Antigravity A1.\nImage by Mat Smith for Engadget\nWith those two camera units, the A1 can capture video in 8K resolution, stretched across a sphere-like canvas from the drone’s point of view. With stitching algorithms that the company has continually improved over five generations of 360-degree cameras, this should result in mostly seamless footage where the A1 never interrupts the view.  The drone itself won’t show up in your video. It’s like the company’s “invisible” selfie stick, but, well, up in the sky.\nThe A1 is unlike any other drone I’ve played with — something I learned when I tested a pre-production unit at a Mercedes-Benz race track in Schlüsselfeld, Germany. Naturally, this included high-speed cars, wet conditions and some near-misses.\nThanks to working at Engadget, I’m a drone dabbler, but Antigravity’s A1 is a different experience from the outset. Controlling the A1 involves strapping on companion goggles and steering it from a first-person perspective, controller in hand. However, unlike other FPV drones, you can look (and move) anywhere you want.\n\nDuring roughly 15 minutes of flying time (you can see the highlights here), I found it’s a surprisingly intuitive experience. With other FPV drones, your view is locked to the direction of the camera. Sure, you can rotate rival drones to see elsewhere, like with DJI’s Avata, but it’s not the same. Because the A1 streams 360-degree video to the goggles, turning your head will never affect the direction it’s facing. Instead, you’ll just see what’s around the drone as it flies, making it far more intuitive for rookie drone pilots. Better still, you can strafe and move around while looking somewhere else — like video game controls for a first-person shooter.\nThis freedom of movement is elevated by the unique A1 controller, which is best described as a blend between a traditional drone controller and a Wiimote. While some of the physical buttons and dials adjust altitude, start/stop video recording and more, steering involves a point-and-click method. When you move your hand out to the right side, a reticle shows up on the goggles’ display. Pressing the trigger then will cause the A1 to shoot out in that direction, an action that Antigravity calls Freemotion control.\nAs I mentioned, this means I don’t have to look where I’m going — although it’s better if I do to avoid accidents (or collisions with an expensive Mercedes). If you’ve been intrigued by FPV drones, this is a simpler experience that feels freer, too. You can look wherever you want, not beholden to where cameras are pointed on other drones. I also think I could get friends and family flying the A1 around with minimal training. Speaking of spectators, Insta360 included a clever touch for them: the goggles have an external screen so that onlookers can see what’s happening. There is nothing duller than watching someone else fly a drone without being able to see their POV.\nImage by Mat Smith for Engadget\nThe A1 is a zippy little drone, presumably thanks to its low weight. But even at this preproduction stage, the resulting video looks better than I thought it would. Plus, it offers substantial versatility if you’re looking for action-packed shots.\nAfter I tested the A1, Antigravity sent me my video from the drone, so I was about to reframe, crop and reposition the footage. You could even use the same 10 seconds and frame (or crop) to three very different angles. For example, you could extract a tracking shot of the car, a zoomed-in shot of the drone pilot or just the blue skies of Germany all from one clip. That’s the exciting part here.\nInsta360 built excellent editing tools (mobile and desktop) for its cameras in the past, and it plans to do the same for its first drone. An early version of the software wasn’t without its hiccups, but editing was easy enough once I figured out that keyframes would anchor the drone's view. I could then add several keyframes together, tagging objects I’d like to keep in frame or track. Editing my footage started to get oddly enjoyable, and I have never enjoyed that task.\nAnother feature the company emphasized is payload detection. While the exact weight limit is still being refined through further testing, Antigravity says the A1 won’t be able to fly if the drone detects it’s carrying something it shouldn’t — a move to further smooth potential license issues. The company also hinted at future accessories and peripherals to expand the A1 experience — something it has successfully done with its action cams and gimbals.\nImage by Mat Smith for Engadget\nSome specs are still a mystery because the drone is a work in progress. To that end, the company is opening up applications for a co-creation project, where participants will get a pre-production Antigravity A1 in exchange for offering feedback. Ideas from these testers will be integrated into the final retail version, and the best ones could win a share of a $20,000 prize pool.\nFlying the A1 around a racetrack was the most fun I've had with a drone in a long time. But, with goggles and a dedicated controller included, how much will a flight cost? That might decide whether Insta360’s Antigravity can carve out a place next to DJI’s army of drones.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cameras/insta360-antigravity-a1-drone-preview-hands-on-130034274.html?src=rss",

David James/Paramount Pictures Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation (2015) Netflix just released the first five movies in the Mission: Impossible franchise and while we really enjoy them all, 2015's Rogue Nation is one of our favorites.

Taylour Paige, Colman Domingo and Glynn Turman all co-star in the film that was adapted from August Wilson's 1982 play. Rustin's outspoken activism and homosexuality made him a target -- not just for political adversaries but sometimes even among his allies.

But the real attention grabber is the lifted chassis and a new off-roading mode that could hint at a possible new direction for GM’s luxury brand. That vehicle was an all-electric, 2+2 coupe designed to showcase Cadillac’s vision for future luxury performance and autonomous driving. Cadillac is back at this year’s Quail with the Elevated Velocity, which is 2+2 crossover that’s also meant to foreshadow potential future design cues. The vehicle rides on 24-inch wheels for better off-road navigation. “Is there more opportunity for higher end performance in this type of form factor and this type of use case relative to, let’s say, more dirt performance?” he responded. The Elevated Velocity aims to channel that energy through Cadillac’s V-series. By producing more V-badged vehicles, Cadillac is hoping to pivot away from its past image as an “old man” automotive brand to one that’s more Gen Z friendly. The interior lighting can be switched to infrared as a therapeutic measure to “boost recovery.” (The Cleveland Clinic says that red light therapy is an unproven method for treating wrinkles and other skin problems; Cadillac’s Nesbitt says its about “exploring different types of technology.”) Maybe those levels are too high – the Elevated Velocity will guide the driver through a breathing exercise to bring them back down to normal levels."

After debuting its affordable $29.99 Elves 2 controller last month, GuliKit is back with another budget-friendly alternative to Nintendo’s Switch 2 Pro Controller — if you prefer an asymmetrical joystick layout. Both the $24.99 GuliKit ES and $29.99 ES Pro controllers are available starting today in gray for the cheaper version and your choice of black or white for the pro model. But the ES and ES Pro will potentially appeal even more to non-competitive gamers who are more interested in finding an affordable alternative to the $89.99 Switch 2 Pro Controller without sacrificing much functionality to hit a lower price point. Both the ES and ES Pro models feature shoulder buttons and Hall effect triggers, but neither have an additional set of back buttons like the Switch 2 Pro controller. The $25 GuliKit ES features anti-drift Hall effect joysticks (Nintendo’s uses the same problematic joystick technology as the previous version) and triggers, a gyroscope for games that support motion controls, and a 950mAh battery with up to 30 hours of playtime. It supports Windows PCs and Android devices, but like GuliKit’s Elves 2, the ES and ES Pro are both Switch compatible and can be used to wake the Switch 2. The pricier $30 GuliKit ES Pro carries forward all the same features but adds upgraded and more precise anti-drift tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) joysticks with adjustable sensitivity, a D-pad that can be switched between four and eight-direction modes, and the ability to swap between PC and Switch button layouts — with alternate buttons being sold separately. The ES and ES Pro can’t be used to scan Amiibo figures, and they don’t have an additional set of buttons on the back. But those seem like small tradeoffs given you’re not only saving over $60 by choosing either of these over Nintendo’s, you’re also getting a controller with better joystick hardware that will potentially last a lot longer."

    "full_text": "It's the company's new flagship project, incubated at Insta360, and I got to test-fly it at a preview event. The company says its intuitive controls make it easy to fly even if you've never flown a first-person view drone, which I haven't. Antigravity's A1 drone was a secret project incubated by Insta360. Antigravity says that the A1 drone can produce similar FPV-style shots while flying in a straight line, thanks to its 360-degree field of view, where camera movements like spins and rotations can be added in post-production using Antigravity's editing software. Insta360 users may already be familiar with this workflow. I had an opportunity to test out the Antigravity A1 drone at a go-kart track. I could change the drone's direction by moving my body, and a red emergency stop button was also easily accessible. It was an intuitive experience, but I felt a slight motion sickness toward the end of my test flight. Overall, I succeeded in not crashing and capturing video, my two primary goals when flying the drone for the first time. The Antigravity A1 drone has no set price yet, but it's set to hit the market in Jan. of 2026."

    "summary": "The back-to-school season is a good time to save on tech, whether you're returning to campus or not. While some discounts are reserved for students, others are available to everyone. One of the best right now is on Apple's M3-powered iPad Air, which is somewhat of a goldilocks tablet — one that will be a great option for just about everyone. You can grab it for $150 off at Amazon right now.\nThis deal applies to each configuration of the 11-inch and 13-inch versions of the most recent iPad Air. So, the 11-inch model is as low as $449, while the 13-inch model is down to $649. The same deals can be found at Best Buy and Target if you prefer to shop somewhere other than Amazon. This is an all-time low price and beats the deal we saw on Prime Day by $30. \n \nThe iPad Air M3 is more of an iterative refresh than a grand overhaul, but the spec bump means it’ll last you a long time before the tablet’s performance becomes a problem. This iPad occupies the position of \"best for most\" in our iPad buying guide, reinforcing that goldilocks analogy. The M3 chip is the main draw here, with Geekbench 6 scores proclaiming it around 16 percent more powerful than the M2 iPad Air, which is no slouch itself.\nBeyond the chip, it has a superior display and speakers to the entry-level model, and wider accessory support. You also get the option of a 13-inch display, which is great for artists or anyone who sees the iPad as a viable laptop replacement.\nIf there’s an obvious downside to the iPad Air M3, it’s that it doesn't have the nice 120Hz OLED display of the iPad Pro. This is hardly surprising, as Apple often focuses on display tech to differentiate its Pro and non-Pro devices, but it’s probably time the refresh rate on the middle-of-the-road iPad at least jumped up to ProMotion. Face ID is long overdue too. If you can live with these caveats, though, the iPad Air is an excellent option, particularly at this price.\nThere are a couple of other iPads on sale at Amazon right now, too, if you think the Air is too much for your needs. The iPad A16, Apple's entry-level tablet, is down to $299, while the latest iPad mini is on sale for $399. Both models were slightly cheaper during Prime Day in July, but these discounts are still worth considering if you're looking to pick up a newer iPad for less.\n \n \nCheck out our coverage of the best Apple deals for more discounts, and follow @EngadgetDeals on X for the latest tech deals and buying advice.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/apples-ipad-air-m3-is-150-off-right-now-162908718.html?src=rss",

Fans can visit Battlefield's website to get info for the open beta, which just requires linking your EA account to your platform account. Aug. 9-10: First open beta weekend available to all. Preloading the Battlefield 6 beta started on Aug. 4. Doing a preload means you'll be able to jump on the beta as soon as it's available instead of waiting for it to download on the day of access. Here are the BF6 Beta download links for each platform: : An urban battlefield in the heart of Egypt. Just like with the maps, each weekend will also feature certain game modes. A special note if you haven't played a Battlefield game on PC recently: Studio DICE and EA recently started requiring players to set their computers to Secure Boot when playing Battlefield games to combat cheaters, and Battlefield 6 is no different."

The Vive Eagle is a rival to Meta's Ray-Ban glasses with a fashion-foward lightweight design, open ear audio, voice-activated AI and an ultra-wide AI-powered camera. They look promising, if a bit expensive, but will only be available in Taiwan to start with.\nThe Taiwanese firm clearly noticed that Meta's Ray-Ban smart glasses have been a surprise hit. It's easy to see why — in our Engadget review, we found that they look great and perform admirably. The current model includes in-ear speakers, cameras, microphones and access to Meta’s virtual assistant.\nHTC has used much the same formula for the Vive Eagle, though they have an uphill battle against Ray-Ban's brand brand in terms of consumer awareness and  style. \"Vive Eagle features a refined aesthetic that conceals its powerful technology in clean, minimalist lines,\" the company wrote. It managed to fit all the technology into a relatively lightweight frame that weighs just 49 grams, only a gram heavier than Meta's Ray-Bans. \nHTC\nOn the camera side, the Vive Eagle comes with a 12MP ultra-wide model with voice-activated AI, offering support for multiple platforms including OpenAI and Gemini. \"With a simple voice command like 'Hey VIVE, take a photo,; users can capture what they see — right from their glasses,\" the company wrote. \nVoice commands also let you do things like record reminders, take notes, and get restaurant recommendations. You can also get real-time translation in 13 languages: Arabic, Traditional Chinese, English, French, German, Greek, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese, Spanish, Korean, Thai, Turkish.\nOn the audio side, the Vive Eagle has an open-ear setup that \"combines large acoustic drivers and virtual bass enhancement to deliver rich, spatial audio while minimizing sound leakage,\" HTC said. It promised that you'll be able to hear music or voice prompts without others overhearing, while still being aware of your surroundings.\n\nHTC promises up to 36 hours of standby time and 4.5 hours of continuous music playback thanks to the 235mAh battery, and you can get to a 50 percent charge (via magnetic fast charging) in just 10 minutes. It also features a \"privacy-first\" architecture with all video and other data stored exclusively on-device — and that is protected via 256-bit AES encryption, according to HTC. \nThe Vive Eagle will only available in Taiwan at first for NT$15,600, or about $520 — quite a bit more than most of Meta's Ray-Ban models. HTC has yet to say if it will bring the Vive Eagle to other territories including the US — but if it does and at that price, it'll be in tough against its rival. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/htc-takes-on-meta-with-the-vive-eagle-smart-glasses-120048879.html?src=rss",

Volpe recommends weighing yourself no more than once a week. Choose an even surface: You want to make sure your scale is on an even surface otherwise that imbalance will throw off the reading. Make sure to weigh yourself in the same place each time. \"Smart scales have not been shown to have high accuracy and cannot be compared to the 'gold standard' measures of assessing bone mineral density and body composition as it relates to body fat and lean body mass, which is via using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry,\" said Volpe. \"The smart scale can provide an estimation of body fat and total body water; but note that the 'gold standard' ways to measure these would provide the more accurate data,\" Volpe explains. Remember your weight fluctuates: It's easy to get caught up in a number, but remember your weight is a range instead of an exact number and will fluctuate throughout the day. Fluctuations can be affected if you work out, eat more than normal, go to the bathroom or even if your muscles are sore and retaining fluid. Keep in mind these are estimations based on your age, sex and body weight. \"Knowing that these scales are providing an estimation -- but without the highest of accuracy -- is important, but can help provide some guidance to the user of these products, especially when many individuals may not have the ability to have their bone mineral density and body composition evaluated by DXA,\" said Volpe."

    "full_text": "We are less than a month away from Apple announcing the rumored iPhone 17. Apple's newest phone, the $599 iPhone 16E, launched in February and offers a unique appeal: Get some of the iPhone 16's best features (a 48-megapixel camera, iOS 18 and an A18 chip for Apple Intelligence) for $200 less than the $799 iPhone 16. Unfortunately, the answer isn't black and white -- it depends. In this picture, we used an iPhone 16 Pro and put the number 17 behind it since there aren't any photos from Apple of its unreleased phone. I have no idea because Apple hasn't announced anything yet. And while many Apple enthusiasts want an iPhone with a truly new design, there is logic to Apple keeping what works for its large base of iPhone users. The true complicating factor between deciding between Apple's brand-new cheap iPhone and its next unannounced flagship model is just that: Do you want a budget-version of the iPhone 16? Or do you want one of Apple's more expensive premium models? Even though the only things we know about the iPhone 17 series are based on rumors, it will likely have a regular base model that starts around $800 and a more premium Pro model that starts at $1,000. If you are due for an upgrade from your carrier, then things get more tricky."

But when Apple releases iOS 26 this fall, it will let you use your AirPods to take photos so you can just worry about getting everyone's best angle. Don't forget, Apple is still beta testing iOS 26. That means the update might be buggy for you and your device's battery life may be affected so it's best to keep those troubles off your primary device. If you want to try out the beta, I recommend downloading it on a secondary device. It's also possible that Apple could adjust the Camera Remote option, and other update features, before the final version of iOS 26 is released this fall. Once Camera Remote is enabled, you can use your AirPods to take a photo or shoot a video with any camera mode, like portrait and time-lapse. The three-second countdown is automatically enabled and I can't find a way to disable it. You can tap 3s, but this won't change the countdown. You can then press your AirPods again to stop recording."

Thankfully, there are a few moves you can make to extend the battery life of your OLED laptop without affecting its performance. There are two easy ways on a Windows laptop to create consistently darker images with fewer bright pixels. Choose a mainly black background by going into Settings and choosing Personalization from the left nav. Dark mode is usually selected on most OLED laptops I test because manufacturers know it helps extend battery life -- while also reducing eye strain. And while you're at it, make your device sleep after 30 minutes or so. You can set the Windows screen saver to spring into action after a period of inactivity. Each one is animated, so you don't need to worry about a static image burning into the screen."

If you want to use AI with your phone, its tools are baked into the heart of the phone experience without you needing to also activate and sign into a third-party service. Open the default camera app and you're met with a neat interface, comprised mostly of the shutter button and zoom levels, with other shooting modes found alongside. It doesn't try to overcomplicate things here, instead letting you quickly shoot images without messing about with settings. The camera's simple software makes it easy to take photos with little effort on your part. The Pixel does offer deeper control if you want it, conveniently hidden behind a small settings icon, rather than requiring you to switch completely into a \"Pro\" mode. For those of you wanting to take manual control of your white balance to warm up a beautiful sunset, the Pixel 9 Pro offers an easy way in. Google has clearly taken notes from Apple's approach in making the Pixel range. Apple's phones may be derided by Android fans for their lack of customization and \"locked down\" nature, but iPhones are famously more simple to operate."

A recent study from the Netherlands' Leiden University, published in the Journal of Psychopathology and Clinical Science, has found that when smartwatches and similar devices record readings on stress, fatigue or sleep, they're frequently getting it wrong. Researchers studied 800 young adults using the same Garmin Vivosmart 4 smartwatch model. Their sensors are fairly limited in what they can do. Watches like these need to be worn correctly at all times (a loose or tight watch may give poor readings, for example), and they typically use basic information like pulse rate and movement to make guesses about health. Those guesses don't always reflect real-world scenarios. A wearable may identify high stress when the real cause of the change was a workout, excitement over good news or sex. And sleep sensing performed the best of them all, with Garmin watches showing a two-thirds chance of noting the differences between a good night's sleep and a bad one. It's also worth noting that smartwatch sensors can become more accurate as technology improves. It would be interesting to run a similar study with the newer Garmin Vivosmart 5 to see if anything has improved, as well as see if other models like the latest versions of the Apple Watch have similar accuracy results."

But the iPhones have always focused first and foremost on delivering some of the best image quality you can get in a camera phone, and as a professional photographer I want to see that same dedication to taking better photos when the iPhone 17 launches in September. The Xiaomi 14 Ultra's camera blew me away with its variable aperture that created stunning starbursts in night time images. Apple has invested in core image quality technologies, not simply used AI to make up for any hardware shortcomings. Apple has been a pioneer in applying machine learning to overcome limitations of tiny smartphone cameras, such as its Deep Fusion imaging technology that captures multiple exposures and blends them into a final, evenly-exposed image. But these are arguably tools to enhance an existing image, and I'm worried that the next iPhone's camera will be all about how you can generate entirely new scenes without even having to step outside your house. The huge rise in popularity of compact cameras shows that people still care about taking real photos. Actual sunset colors casting across golden sandy beaches, not an AI's generic interpretation of what a beach looks like. AI has its place and I'm braced for Apple's September event to be extremely AI-focused. As AI seeps deeper into our phone experience and Apple pushes on with its AI strategy, I'm concerned that the company could make rash decisions with its imaging experience in order to try and justify the existence of Apple Intelligence."

Also on tap could be new Apple Watch models — including the first Ultra model in two years — and (maybe) the long-awaited AirPods Pro 3.\nApple's iPhone family will likely welcome a new member this year. The iPhone Air is expected to be roughly 5.55 mm thick. The thinnest model so far has been 2014's iPhone 6, at 6.9 mm. And they've only gotten chunkier since then. (The iPhone 16 Pro has a depth of 8.25 mm.) So, the Air would stand out from its peers in that respect. It would also give Apple a direct rival to Samsung's Galaxy S25 Edge, which we found to be more than a gimmick.\nBut the iPhone Air's thin design will likely lead to some compromises. It's rumored to have only a single 48 MP camera and a smaller battery. So, expect a stylish phone that... won't be for everyone.\nBrian Oh for Engadget\nThe Pro lineup could offer some design tweaks and performance improvements. The iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max are rumored to switch from titanium to aluminum. They could also see the rear camera array expand to an entire \"island\" that extends across most of the phone's backside. It's expected to house three cameras (as before), but multiple rumors have suggested it will have an improved telephoto one. The zoom lens could jump to 48MP, which would strengthen its digital zooming / cropping chops. The phones may also add an anti-glare coating, similar to those found on iPads.\nThe standard iPhone 17 could see some welcome display upgrades. At least one supply chain source claimed it will add a 120Hz variable refresh rate (ProMotion) display, which the Pro series has used since 2021.\nApple\nOne thing we know without a doubt is that the new iPhones will launch with iOS 26, which brings Apple's biggest design refresh in years. It's easy to imagine the company highlighting the new model's displays as the best way to experience the new Liquid Glass visual language. As for the naming scheme, there haven't been any leaks pointing to a similar hardware rebranding (\"iPhone 26,\" \"iPhone 26 Pro,\" etc.). But hey, Apple does like surprises.\nEngadget's iPhone 17 rumor roundup gives you a deeper dive into what to expect from the new models.\nCherlynn Low for Engadget\nApple's fall event isn't just for iPhones. The company is also expected to roll out new Apple Watch models. 5G and a processor upgrade are expected for the Apple Watch Ultra 3. It may also let you send texts via satellite, handy for those who use it out in the wilderness. Regardless of the details, Apple hasn't launched a new rugged and premium model since 2023 (apart from a new color), so it's due for an upgrade.\nThe Series 11 model is unlikely to depart dramatically from the Series 10. After all, that model introduced a new design, with a thinner body and larger screen. (And Apple has historically kept those around in three-year cycles.). But a faster chip also seems logical. Perhaps we'll see 5G arrive on the standard wearable, too.\nWe may also see the AirPods Pro 3 at the event. It's been about three years since Apple last upgraded its premium earbuds. The new model could also bring some biometric sensors to the earphones: an in-ear heart-rate monitor and (maybe) temperature sensing. Live translation is also rumored, although that may not be exclusive to the third-gen model.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/what-to-expect-at-apples-iphone-17-event-090059189.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Tablets are the perfect middle ground between your phone and laptop, giving you the best of both worlds. Whether you want a lightweight device to binge your favorite shows, a larger screen for mobile gaming or a portable way to get some work done on the go, a tablet can do it all. They’re also great for keeping kids entertained, managing work tasks or sharing family moments through video calls. When a phone feels too small and lugging around a laptop is just too much, that’s where tablets fit into the mix.For many, the Apple iPad is the go-to choice, and it’s easy to see why with its smooth performance and endless app options. But don’t worry if iOS isn’t your thing — there are plenty of Android alternatives out there, offering the same level of flexibility without locking you into Apple’s ecosystem. Plus, if you’re on a budget, there are more affordable options that still pack a punch. Whether you’re looking for a premium tablet for work, a kid-friendly device with parental controls or just a reliable everyday companion, we’ve tested all of the big players (and many others) to find the best tablets worth your money right now.\nTable of contents\n\nBest tablets for 2025\nImportant things to consider before buying a tablet\nHow we test tablets\nOther tablets we tested\nTablet FAQs\nTablet accessories\n\nBest tablets for 2025\n \n \n \n \n \nImportant things to consider before buying a tablet\nBefore you start looking at specific devices, the number one thing you should do is figure out what you plan to use your new tablet for. That’s because if all you need is something to keep a kid busy, buying a brand new Apple iPad Air or iPad Pro doesn’t make a ton of sense. On the flip side, if you want to use a tablet for video editing or drawing, you’ll need to take things like performance, versatility and stylus support more seriously — especially if you're considering using it as a laptop replacement. \nYou’ll also want to think about stuff like how often you plan on traveling with the device and if it’s more for productivity, or for less demanding stuff like web browsing or streaming shows. There’s also an important trade-off to consider when it comes to battery life as well. Larger devices tend to have longer runtimes, though an increase in size may make it less portable.\nHow we test tablets\nWhen evaluating different tablets, there are a few important things we look for above all else: solid performance, a good screen and long battery life. For performance, we run a handful of synthetic tests like Geekbench 6, while also performing a number of hands-on, real-world use cases such as editing photos and playing games. And with tablets often serving as hybrid devices, we also consider how easy it is to multitask and switch quickly between various apps. The more responsive a device feels, the better.\nBecause a tablet’s display is such a critical component, we also view a wide range of content to gauge things like brightness, color gamut and dynamic range. It’s important to take into account the difference between various panel types like OLED, which typically produce richer colors and excellent contrast but may not be as bright as a mini LED display. Recently, refresh rate has become an increasingly important spec as 90Hz and 120Hz screens can make scrolling smoother and graphics appear sharper in games.\nWe also consider a tablet’s design (including things like size, weight and water resistance), its connectivity (WiFi, Bluetooth, NFC, 5G, et cetera) and special features like stylus support or the ability to serve as a secondary display. That’s because, while tablets were often viewed as content consumption devices in the past, higher-end devices like the Surface Pro and iPad Pro are more than capable of replacing a laptop for a lot of people.\nFinally, we test battery life by running our standard local video rundown test, which involves playing a single video on a loop from 100 percent until it runs out of juice. Ideally, a tablet should be able to last an entire working day, but longer runtimes are always welcome — especially for users relying on them for productivity, entertainment and storage options on the go.\nOther tablets we tested\nApple iPad mini\nApple updated the iPad mini for 2024 with some under-the-hood changes including a new processor and additional RAM to help support Apple Intelligence features. While the iPad mini is one of the best iPads you can buy, its small size makes it a bit niche. Only if you prefer your tablet be the size of an ereader should you consider this one.\nGoogle Pixel Tablet\nThe Google Pixel Tablet excels as a smart display rather than a simple tablet. As the latter, it's unexciting, but when paired with its speaker/charging dock, it becomes much more useful. It could be a good option for those that already live within the Google ecosystem and use the Google Assistant often, or those who like the idea of a tablet that can be docked and used as a smart display as well.\nOnePlus Pad\nThe solid OnePlus Pad is let down by Android because there aren't many Android apps designed to be used on a large display like this model's 11.6-inch panel. Otherwise, the hardware is well-designed, its companion stylus is comfortable to use and it has an excellent battery life.\nTablet FAQs\nWhat is the best brand for tablets?\nThe best brand for tablets is really the brand you feel most comfortable with. We recommend taking stock of the gadgets you already have — do you live in the Apple ecosystem already? An iPad might be best for you then. Do you have a Samsung phone? If so, a Galaxy Tab will likely be the most convenient choice. There is no one \"best brand\" for tablets; you’ll find good options made by companies including Apple, Google, Samsung, Microsoft and Amazon.\nCan a tablet replace a laptop?\nIt’s possible for a tablet to replace a laptop, but you’ll need a few accessories to truly make the experience as close as possible to that of a traditional notebook. A keyboard is a must, be it a keyboard case or a Bluetooth accessory that you keep with you. Some keyboard cases, like apple’s Magic Keyboard for the iPad, have a built-in trackpad, which will be more ergonomic than tapping on your tablet’s screen for input. Additionally, you could go one step further and use a wireless mouse that connects via Bluetooth to your tablet. If you’re primarily looking for a tablet to replace your laptop, consider buying a 2-in-1 laptop since those systems typically consist of high-powered tablets that are designed to work well with (and without) keyboards.\nWhat size screen do I need?\nFiguring out the best screen size for you will also be related to the kind of work (or play) you intend to do. Larger screens make it much easier to view two apps side by side, and big screens also deliver a more immersive movie viewing experience — especially when paired with an OLED display or Liquid Retina display. But at the same time, the larger the tablet, the less likely you’re going to want to move it around. That means you’re not only going to want to take stock of your workspace (i.e., if you have a desk or instead plan to work from a couch or even your bed), but you’re also going to want to think about how the device will fit into your everyday routine or commute (if you have one).\nTablet accessories\nFinally, you’ll want to consider any add-ons or accessories you’re planning to use, which can range from detachable keyboards to things like external mics or a stylus. The good news is that many of the best tablets nowadays offer some kind of keyboard accessory, which allows the device to function more like a 2-in-1 instead of simply being a content consumption device. Some tablets also feature things like microSD card slots that support expandable storage, or optional 4G or 5G connectivity, which can be a real boon to frequent travelers. And if you’re planning to use the tablet mainly for work, you might want to grab a USB hub for connecting all your favorite peripherals so your devices don’t have to fight for the charger.\nRecent updates\nJuly 2025: Updated to ensure our top picks and buying advice remain accurate.\nMay 2025: Updated to ensure our top picks and buying advice remain accurate.\nMarch 2025: Updated to include the latest base iPad in our top picks,\nFebruary 2025: Updated to include clarification around our top picks and new buying advice.\nOctober 2024: We updated this list to include information on the new iPad mini 7.\nJune 2024: We updated our top picks to include the Microsoft Surface Pro Copilot+ edition.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/best-tablets-150026056.html?src=rss",

These tablets are even rated IP68 for water and dust resistance – so if you want to take your S9 in the bath and watch a movie, you don’t have to worry about destroying it if it slips into the tub. Its neural processing unit (NPU) also enables potentially powerful AI features, though the current crop won’t be useful to everyone. It’s also nice to see Microsoft pack in 16GB of RAM with the base Surface Pro model. The A16 chip is plenty fast for most common iPad Things, while battery life remains solid at roughly 10 hours per charge. There’s also a handy dashboard for parents that allows you to set time limits, content filters and educational goals.

So over the years, I've done everything I can think of to stay cool while sleeping — switched my comforter to a light quilt, my cotton pillowcase to a silk one, my pajamas to breathable fabrics like linen — but funny enough, the most helpful change I made cost me nothing and it was right in my linen closet. I've never been a flat sheet person, so they sit in my linen closet and go unused, but after this trip, I thought I'd give one a try. Since I share my bed with my partner, I couldn't get rid of our quilt completely, so I simply placed the flat sheet under it and then adjusted it so the quilt was only covering my feet. Regarding the latter, I recently saw a TikTok video in which a person mentioned that they experienced more quality sleep when their feet were warm and their head was cool. Similarly, a 2018 study found that keeping your feet warm with bed socks while sleeping in a cool environment had positive effects on sleep quality. This is simply one study and one anecdotal TikTok video, but I figured it was even more reason to try the flat sheet on top and quilt on the bottom. I've been doing this for several months, and ever since I started, my night sweats have greatly decreased. However, they do pop up during certain phases of my menstrual cycle or when I'm especially stressed, but you can't win them all. The best part is that I spent nothing to pare down my night sweats."

You still need to choose one but you get two free network transfers and then pay $2 per transfer if you want to switch again after that -- it’s a good way to see which one works best in your area. Dark Star data speeds are at a reduced priority (dubbed QCI 9) in times of network congestion; for an additional $12 a month you can bump that up to a higher priority (QCI 8). With the Warp level, data speeds are at QCI 9 as of Aug. 18, 2025, with the ability to pay more for a QCI-8 add-on; plans in place before then are grandfathered at the QCI 8 speed. The Light Speed level is even higher priority at QCI 7. The Unlimited Flex plan gives you 10GB of high-speed data, then unlimited at 1Mbps, for just $17.50 a month if you purchase an annual plan (otherwise it’s $25 a month). Someone looking for a simple phone line who doesn’t expect to use much data. If you’re frequently away from Wi-Fi, that data could go by in a hurry. It’s also not a great option if you need consistently high speeds or you don’t want the complexity of choosing one of the three networks."

    "summary": "Liquid Glass is a huge new change coming to iOS 26. (Apple)\nNext month, we'll finally get the option to download iOS 26 on our iPhones (screenshots are way better in the latest operating system!). Until then, you can download and install the newly released public beta 2 (or iOS 26 developer beta 6 for developers). During Apple's recent earnings call, CEO Tim Cook said its collection of upcoming beta operating systems (including iOS) are \"by far the most popular developer betas we’ve had,\" 9to5Mac reports. You can also take a look at our preview of the iOS 26 public beta release, which shows off the fresh home and lock screen redesign. Called Liquid Glass, the new translucent look will extend across all of Apple's upcoming operating systems. The overhaul is one of several big changes coming to iOS, macOS, iPadOS and the rest of Apple's software suite, all of which were showcased during the company's WWDC keynote on June 9.\nAfter overpromising on AI plans last year, Apple kept its iOS roadmap focused more on basic quality of life improvements this year. There are multiple useful additions coming to the Phone and Messages apps on your iPhone, for instance: Apple execs outlined the ability to weed out spam texts or other unknown senders and an option to hold your spot on a phone call when you've been waiting for a representative to pick up. Plus, a treasured feature that we took for granted is coming back (hint: it's in the Photos app).\nSiri, meanwhile, is in a holding pattern. Apple has previously specified that its smarter voice assistant — first promised at WWDC 2024 — is delayed until some point \"in the coming year,\" so you shouldn't expect any major changes in the current betas. But there are reports that Apple is aiming to give Siri a bigger brain transplant by basing it on third-party artificial intelligence models like OpenAI's ChatGPT or Anthropic's Claude, which could make 2026 a pivotal year. The company is also reportedly working on a 'stripped-down' AI chatbot to rival ChatGPT.\nWith each beta, it seems like additional new improvements are popping up, like this new AirPods gesture we're all curious about, and this FaceTime feature that'll freeze your video if it detects nudity. With the release of the iOS 26 developer beta 5, we saw more added features, like a new bouncy animation on the passcode screen and in the Control Center, MacRumors reports. Some or all of those changes will likely soon migrate into the separate public beta (see below). Most newer iPhone models are eligible to download iOS 26 (both the betas and final version). Want to see the full list of new features coming this fall? Read on. \nWhat is iOS 26?\nThe current iPhone operating system is iOS 18, and Apple is still actively updating it — version 18.6 was just recently released. But don't expect to see iOS 19. Instead, Apple is skipping the numbering ahead to iOS 26 later this year. The company has decided to line up its iOS version numbers with a year-based system, similar to car model years. So while iOS and its sibling operating systems will be released in late 2025, they're all designated \"26\" to reflect the year ahead. \nIt's official, we're moving to iOS 26. (Apple)\nWhat is Liquid Glass design?\nLet's be honest. Out of everything announced at WWDC this year, the new Liquid Glass design was the star of the show. The iPhone's home and lock screens have looked pretty much the same year after year — the last exciting thing (in my opinion) was the option to add your own aesthetic to your home screen by customizing your apps and widgets. So seeing the home and lock screens' new facelift is refreshing.\nSo what exactly is Liquid Glass? Apple calls it a \"new translucent material\" since, well, the apps and widgets are clear. However, the screen can still adapt to dark and light modes, depending on surroundings. You'll also notice buttons with a new floating design in several apps, like Phone and Maps. They're designed to be less distracting than the current buttons, but are still easy to see. While the design overhaul has proven to be controversial since its announcement, some — including Engadget's own Devindra Hardawar — like the new direction, even if it's somewhat reminiscent of Microsoft's translucent Windows Vista Aero designs from nearly twenty years ago.\nThat said, as of the release of the iOS 26 beta 2, Apple has already incorporated some user feedback into the design, dialing back the transparency in at least some places. And while it will continue to evolve, Apple users won't be able to escape it: Liquid Glass was designed to make all of Apple's OSes more cohesive. Here's a look at how the translucent aesthetic will look with the new macOS Tahoe 26 on your desktop.\nWhat are the new and notable features of iOS 26?\niOS 26 has a laundry list of new features. Among the most worthwhile:\nPhone app redesign: You'll finally be able to scroll through contacts, recent calls and voicemail messages all on one screen. It also comes with a new feature called Hold Assist that'll notify you when an agent comes to the phone so you can avoid the elevator music and continue on with other tasks.\nLive Translation in Phone, FaceTime and Messages: iOS 26 is bringing the ability to have a conversation via phone call or text message with someone who speaks another language. Live Translation will translate your conversation in real time, which results in some stop-and-go interactions in the examples Apple shared during its presentation.\nPolls in group chats: Tired of sorting through what seems like hundreds of messages in your group chat? You and your friends will soon be able to create polls in group messages for deciding things like which brunch spot you're eating at or whose car you're taking on a road trip.\nFiltering unknown senders in Messages: If you haven't received spam texts about unpaid tolls or other citations, you're lucky. For those of us who have, those annoying messages will soon be filtered away in a separate folder.\nVisual Intelligence: Similar to a reverse Google image search, this new feature will allow you to search for anything that's on your iPhone screen. For instance, if you spot a pair of shoes someone is wearing in an Instagram photo, you can screenshot it and use Visual Intelligence to find those shoes (or similar ones) online.\nPhotos tabs are back: For anyone who's still frustrated with the Photos changes made last year, you'll be happy to know that your tabs are coming back. Library and Collections will have their own separate spaces so you don't have to scroll to infinity to find what you're looking for.\nFaceTime \"Communication Safety\" feature: A newer addition to iOS 26 appears to be the FaceTime \"Communication Safety\" feature that pauses communications if and when nudity is detected. The feature appears to be a child safety feature that uses on-device detection, thus obviating any cloud-based privacy issues. \nNew lock screen options: The iPhone lock screen gets more customizable in iOS 26, with a cooler clock, 3D wallpaper effects, more widgets and better focus mode options. \nApple's Hold Assist will be nifty for those pesky services that put you on hold for 10 or more minutes. (Apple)\nNew changes coming to iPadOS 26\nYour iPad isn't getting left behind when it comes to big updates. Here's what's coming this fall.\nMultitasking and real windowing: When you download the newest update, you'll be able to have multiple apps running on your screen at the same time. Once you open an app, it'll appear on your screen as normal but you'll be able to resize and move it across your screen to make room for other apps. This feature is optional so you can turn it off if you don't like it.\nVisual update: Along with the other new OSes, iPadOS 26 is coming with the Liquid Glass aesthetic. This new look will appear on the lock and home screens, as well as the drop-down menus.\nNew menu bar: When you swipe down on your screen, the new menu bar will appear with options like File, Edit, Windows and more. There's also a search option if you're looking for something specific.\nCheck out our first impressions of iPadOS 26. \nWhat about AirPods?\nAirPods are also getting updated with iOS 26. Here are some of the more notable functions.\nEnhanced audio recording: Apple calls this \"studio-quality\" audio recording, and with it, you'll notice more clarity while in noisy environments.\nCamera remote control: Using this, you can take a photo or start and stop video recording with just one press on your AirPods. When taking photos, you'll get a three-second countdown before your iPhone or iPad snaps the picture.\nLive translation feature: While not officially announced or confirmed, it appears that the long-rumored live translation for AirPods could be coming with iOS 26. The evidence comes from a system asset spotted in the in iOS 26 beta showing a gesture that's triggered by pressing both earbud stems at the same time. The photo also shows words in several different languages. \nWhich iPhones will be able to upgrade to iOS 26?\nA few iPhone models that run the current version of iOS — iPhone XR, XS and XS Max — won't be compatible with the latest upgrade. But any iPhones released in 2019 or later will be eligible for the iOS 26 update.\n\niPhone SE (second generation or later)\niPhone 11\niPhone 11 Pro\niPhone 11 Pro Max\niPhone 12\niPhone 12 mini\niPhone 12 Pro\niPhone 12 Pro Max\niPhone 13\niPhone 13 mini\niPhone 13 Pro\niPhone 13 Pro Max\niPhone 14\niPhone 14 Plus\niPhone 14 Pro\niPhone 14 Pro Max\niPhone 15\niPhone 15 Plus\niPhone 15 Pro\niPhone 15 Pro Max\niPhone 16\niPhone 16 Plus\niPhone 16 Pro\niPhone 16 Pro Max\niPhone 16e\n\nNot listed here are the presumed new iPhone 17 models (or maybe iPhone 26?) that are all but certain to be announced and released in September. \nHow to install iOS 26 beta\nThe iOS 26 public beta is now available to download via the Apple Beta Software Program. If you're not already a member, you'll need to sign up to try out all the latest features. Just visit beta.apple.com and sign up with your phone number or email address. It's free.\nOnce you're in, you can install it by going to Settings > General > Software Update and selecting iOS 26 public beta. \nA word of caution: Don't sign up with your main iPhone unless you're OK with any risks that occur with using an OS that isn't finalized.\nWhen will the final version of iOS 26 be released?\niOS 26 will be released to the public this fall. It usually comes in September, within a week of the Apple iPhone event. Last year, it rolled out to iPhone users on September 16 — exactly one week after the iPhone 16 lineup was announced.\nIf you're more interested in the Apple Intelligence features coming, here's everything Apple revealed for iOS, macOS and more during WWDC. Also, check out how iOS 26 screenshots could be an intriguing preview of Apple's delayed Siri rework.\nUpdate, August 13: Added new AirPods detail spotted in the iOS 26 beta.\nUpdate, August 11: Noted that iOS 26 developer beta has hit beta 6. \nUpdate, August 8: Added new features coming with iPadOS 26 and AirPods.\nUpdate, August 6: Noted the release of iOS 26 beta 5 and the new bouncy feature on passcode screen and Control Center.\nUpdate, August 4: Noted that Apple is reportedly working on a ChatGPT rival.\nUpdate, August 1: Added quote from Tim Cook about iOS 26.\nUpdate, July 31: Noted that iOS 18.6 is now available. \nUpdate, July 24: Noted the iOS 26 public beta is now available.\nUpdate, July 3: Noted new FaceTime feature found in the developer beta.\nUpdate, June 30: Noted ongoing iOS 18 releases, and reports that Apple is considering additional external LLMs for Siri. \nUpdate, June 25: Noted changes added in iOS 26 beta 2. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/ios-26-public-beta-2-adds-new-apple-features-everything-to-know-about-the-apple-iphone-updates-135749765.html?src=rss",
    "full_text": "Called Liquid Glass, the new translucent look will extend across all of Apple's upcoming operating systems. Plus, a treasured feature that we took for granted is coming back (hint: it's in the Photos app). Some or all of those changes will likely soon migrate into the separate public beta (see below). Most newer iPhone models are eligible to download iOS 26 (both the betas and final version). So while iOS and its sibling operating systems will be released in late 2025, they're all designated \"26\" to reflect the year ahead. You'll also notice buttons with a new floating design in several apps, like Phone and Maps. Phone app redesign: You'll finally be able to scroll through contacts, recent calls and voicemail messages all on one screen. Camera remote control: Using this, you can take a photo or start and stop video recording with just one press on your AirPods. When taking photos, you'll get a three-second countdown before your iPhone or iPad snaps the picture.

    "summary": "If Apple sticks to its usual schedule, we should see the company reveal its latest lineup of smartphones: the iPhone 17 models. The new models will come equipped with the latest iOS 26 features preinstalled, along with whatever additional features Apple reveals at the launch event. But since we still have to wait a few weeks (presumably) until the iPhone event, we can at least speculate what the new phones will look like. As with most unreleased iPhone models, rumors and leaks have trickled in about the hardware side ahead of the official introduction. Here's what we're expecting and what we can reasonably assume we'll get from Cupertino in September.\nHow much will the iPhone 17 cost?\nApple's announced plan to expand US-based manufacturing partners seems to give it at least some shielding from the steepest Trump administration tariffs that have already triggered price increases on everything from Switch consoles to high-end cameras to Sonos speakers. But given that President Trump's trade policies can change from week to week, and Apple's continuing reliance on Asia-based supply chains, price shocks remain an ongoing possibility. The bigger question is: Will Apple absorb any higher costs, or pass them on to consumers? \nIf prices do creep up, Apple may choose to pair it with an \"upgrade.\" Consider this recent rumor posted by MacRumors from a leaker known as \"Instant Digital,\" suggesting that the default storage of the iPhone 17 line may start at 256GB, doubling the current 128GB baseline. While that could be accompanied by a price increase of $50, Apple could at least pitch it as a \"better value.\" That said, the company doubled the default RAM of its Mac computers from 8GB to 16GB at no extra cost in 2024 — but that was before the current Trump tariff cycle started.\nWhen will the iPhone 17 series be announced?\nMost years, the flagship smartphones are introduced in September. MacRumors highlighted a story originally reported by iphone-ticker.de that the Apple iPhone 17 event could be Tuesday, September 9, according to information gleaned from German mobile phone providers.\nIt's still too early to have the specific dates; some years, Apple only gives a week or two of lead time between sending invites and hosting the event. But years of past precedent show that sometime in September should be when the 17 models make their debut. This family of smartphones may be the last to follow that trend, however. There have been hints that the introduction of the iPhone 18 collection in 2026 will be split into a pro-tier announcement in the fall and a standard model announcement the following spring.\nWhat will the new iPhone 17 lineup include?\nDesign leaks suggest that Apple is building an ultra-thin smartphone, likely to be named the iPhone 17 Air to match Apple's ultralight laptop designation. Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, often a solid source of advanced intel about Apple, reported in January that the iPhone 17 Air will be equipped with a basic A19 chip and will only have a single camera lens. It may also use Apple's new in-house modem, which was introduced in February on the iPhone 16e. More details about this development may leak ahead of September, but that's what we know for now.\nAn investor note from Apple analyst Jeff Pu indicated that the Air will have a titanium frame. If his reports are accurate, the lightweight smartphone will be the only entry in the iPhone 17 lineup to use that metal; the iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone 17 Pro Max are expected to be made of aluminum, which is oddly a lighter material than titanium. Other speculation had suggested that the Air would use a blend of aluminum and titanium, so the exact materials may not be known until the official announcement.\nAdditionally, an August 4 MacRumors report says the internal battery pack of the iPhone Air is just 2.49mm thick — half the thickness of the iPhone 17 Pro battery. The leak was posted on the Korean-language Naver blog, where they show the alleged batteries of the iPhone 17 Air and 17 Pro side by side. The same account claimed the 17 Air's battery capacity was a mere 2,800 mAh, MacRumors notes. (That's below the battery capacity of current iPhone 16 models.)\nA recent rumor from Majin Bu, whom MacRumors classifies as a \"hit-or-miss leaker,\" suggests the iPhone 17 Pro will have better wireless signal strength thanks to an updated antenna design. The individual posted a render on X that shows a new antenna system that wraps around the iPhone 17 Pro's supposedly wider rear camera bump. Again, this is a render, not a real-world photo. That said, we can't knock the goal of better wireless reception, so we're hoping this one has a degree of truth to it.\nEach new roster includes a base model, but over the years, Apple has shaken up the variety of phones it offers. Most likely there will be an iPhone 17 and an iPhone 17 Pro. Apple has also committed to the size matters philosophy, and has been building an iPhone Pro Max option with an even bigger screen and better battery life; the 17 roster will almost certainly have one as well. \nThe new Pro iPhones are said to have a full-width \"camera island\" on the rear, which would mark the first time an Apple model opted for that design. This feature can be seen in the purported iPhone 17 \"spotted in the wild.\" The pics, highlighted on MacRumors, show a black cased iPhone (17 Pro?) with the distinct back panel. Is it the real deal? The dual angles lend a degree of credibility in a social media landscape increasingly polluted with AI-enhanced fakes, but your guess is as good as ours.\nI just spotted a test development iPhone in the wild 🤩🤩🤩 pic.twitter.com/iS3PtKWqxJ— Fox Pupy 🦊🧡 (@Skyfops) July 28, 2025\n\nThe iPhone 17 Air seems primed to take the place of a potential iPhone 17 Plus. Since the iPhone 16e was only just introduced in February at a surprisingly high price point, it seems unlikely that there will be a new addition to that lower end of the spectrum, the models that were previously called SE. \nAt the very least, it sounds like the iPhone 17 Air won't take away the charging port and rely only on wireless connectivity. Bloomberg said that while Apple had investigated making the iPhone 17 Air without a single port, the company (fortunately) changed plans. He also says that the rumored phone will have a 6.6-inch screen and include the Dynamic Island and Camera Control button. Finally, the price is rumored at $900 — likely more than the standard iPhone 17 but less than the Pro.\nWe've also gotten what seems to be a reliable look at what the color lineup will be for the new smartphones. Macworld reported that the iPhone 17 will be available in black, white, steel gray, green, purple and light blue. The iPhone 17 Air will reportedly have four color options: black, white, light blue and light gold. While the Air colors will be less saturated, the visuals for the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max will go bold. The options for the Pro models are expected to be black, white, gray, dark blue and orange.\nOn July 30, Tom's Guide highlighted an X post from Sonny Dickson — a longtime and generally reliable leaker of unreleased iPhone information — showing \"dummy\" iPhone 17 models in the new colors that were the source of the aforementioned Macworld story. While these are literally just mock-ups — not real, leaked iPhones — it's interesting to see how the design and color rumors translate into a real-world look and feel.\nWhat will iOS 26 be like?\nApple upended its numbering conventions with WWDC 2025, and will match the name of each new operating system to the year it's released. So when the next wave of iPhones hits, they'll be running on iOS 26.\nOn the design side, the smartphone OS introduced during the big developer showcase took a contentious approach dubbed Liquid Glass. Apple has been scaling down the amount of transparency effects in the subsequent beta tests of iOS 26, but it will still have a glass-like visual.\nThe feature list includes big and small updates. On the more impactful side, the Phone and Photos apps have been redesigned. There will be several features leveraging artificial intelligence, such as live translation capabilities coming to Phone, FaceTime and Messages. Apple is also currently testing a sensitive content warning for child accounts that will freeze FaceTime video if nudity is detected by on-device machine learning tools. And the company is also launching Visual Intelligence, which will use AI to search for elements in an image.\niOS 26 also has a litany of minor, quality of life improvements. Group texts are getting support for polls. And for the slow risers out there, iOS 26 will finally let you escape the tyranny of the nine minute snooze alarm. \nThe next iOS is now available as a public beta. Here are our initial impressions of the Liquid Glass design and other new features. iOS 26 is compatible with all models back through iPhone 11.\nWhat other products are expected to be released alongside the iPhone 17?\nIf Apple follows its usual pattern, the iPhone 17 will be announced alongside new Apple Watch products. That would be the Apple Watch Series 11 (if Apple sticks to the same naming scheme), and maybe an Apple Watch Ultra 3 and/or an updated Apple Watch SE. (They'll all run watchOS 26, of course.)\nOther possibilities — and this is, again, speculation — could include refreshed Apple AirPods Pro (which received its last big update in 2022) and maybe new AirTags trackers (first released in 2021).\nBut knowing Apple doesn't like to take the spotlight off its star performer — the iPhone — those accessories could come sometime later in the year (if they appear this year at all). The same goes for rumored refreshes of the Apple TV and HomePod mini, which are also getting long in the tooth.\nDon't expect any Macs or iPads, however. Apple has recently been holding computer updates for late October (as it did last year with the new M4 Macs).\nUpdate, August, 13, 2025, 10:02PM ET: Added a list of the products that are expected to be released alongside the iPhone 17s. \nUpdate, August 11, 2025, 7:27PM ET: Added a render of a rumored new antenna design for the iPhone 17 Pro.\nUpdate, August 8, 2025, 4:43PM ET: Added new speculation and reports about iPhone 17 pricing.\nUpdate, August 6, 2025, 4:05PM ET: Added latest details about the potential iPhone 17 event date.\nUpdate, August 4, 2025, 5:23PM ET: Added latest battery leaks about the iPhone 17 models.\nUpdate, August 1, 2025, 8:15AM ET: Added new photos showing potential iPhone 17 colors.\nUpdate, July 30, 2025, 11:08AM ET: Added latest leaks and rumors about the iPhone 17, and updated information on the iOS 26 public beta.\nUpdate, July 17, 2025, 4:40PM ET: Added latest information about iOS 26, possible materials for the Air, and the color options for the different models.\nUpdate, March 17, 2025, 2PM ET: Added details about the rumored price and features of the iPhone 17 Air.\nUpdate, April 11, 2025, 3:45PM ET: Added details from Front Page Tech's new video that claims to reveal details from a leaked iOS 19 build.\nKatie Teague contributed to this story.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/iphone-17-release-is-rumored-for-september-everything-you-need-to-know-ahead-of-the-apple-fall-event-153024317.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "\niOS 26 and iPadOS 26 are coming this fall, bringing huge upgrades to your iPhone and iPad's operating systems. A pretty cool option available on both is the visual update, called Liquid Glass — it's like the better-executed version of Windows Vista. We spent two weeks test-driving it — you can check out our detailed hands-on iOS 26 preview, or you can try it out yourself by downloading and installing the public beta 2. That software is a more stable iteration of the separate developer version, which recently hit the beta 6 waypoint, and offers a few more flashy features not yet available in the public version. (While the public beta is open to everyone and quite stable, always remember there's a degree of risk involved with beta software.) Additionally, there are credible reports that iOS 26 could bring a new live translation feature to AirPods, too. Not ready to upgrade your smartphone or tablet this year? No worries, we'll help you find out if your devices will be able to run iOS 26.\nWhile Apple didn't nix any iPhones from its eligibility list last year, that's not the case for 2025 — a few models are getting cut this time. All iPhone 8 models and the iPhone X were the last to get the boot in 2023, and this year the 2018 models are getting left behind. If you have an ineligible device, you won't be able to download iOS 26 when it becomes available this fall. \nWe'll get to the bottom of which iPhones and iPads will support iOS 26 and iPadOS 26 this year. To see what's coming with the latest OSes, check out everything announced at Apple's WWDC June 9 event. One thing you shouldn't immediately expect is Apple's updated version of Siri, though the company is reportedly working on a 'stripped-down' AI chatbot to compete with ChatGPT. \nThese three iPhones won't be compatible with iOS 26\nUnlike last year, several iPhone models won't be eligible to download the newest iOS when it makes its debut this fall. This trio of models first released in 2018 won't be coming to the iOS 26 party:\n\niPhone XR\niPhone XS\niPhone XS Max\n\niPhones compatible with iOS 26\nWhile we don't yet know the new iPhones Apple will be dropping this fall — though there are iPhone 17 rumors — we do know, per Apple's site, that the phones listed below will be compatible with iOS 26. Basically, if you have an iPhone that was announced in 2019 or later, you're in the clear:\n\niPhone SE (second generation or later)\niPhone 11\niPhone 11 Pro\niPhone 11 Pro Max\niPhone 12\niPhone 12 mini\niPhone 12 Pro\niPhone 12 Pro Max\niPhone 13\niPhone 13 mini\niPhone 13 Pro\niPhone 13 Pro Max\niPhone 14\niPhone 14 Plus\niPhone 14 Pro\niPhone 14 Pro Max\niPhone 15\niPhone 15 Plus\niPhone 15 Pro\niPhone 15 Pro Max\niPhone 16\niPhone 16 Plus\niPhone 16 Pro\niPhone 16 Pro Max\niPhone 16e\n\niPads compatible with iPadOS 26\nThe iPads listed below, and any iPads released later this year, are eligible to download iPadOS 26.\n\niPad Pro (M4)\niPad Pro 12.9‑inch (3rd generation and later)\niPad Pro 11‑inch (1st generation and later)\niPad Air (3rd generation and later, including M2 and M3)\niPad (8th generation and later, including A16)\niPad mini (5th generation and later, including A17 Pro)\n\nWhat if I don't want to buy a new iPhone?\nIf you want to continue using your older iPhone that isn't supported by iOS 26, that's fine. However, you'll miss out on security updates which could potentially put your phone at risk for malware and other threats. Additionally, some apps may stop working if they require a certain version of iOS or later. And of course, you won't be able to access the latest features iOS 26 offers.\nWhen will iOS 26 become available?\nApple usually rolls out its latest iOS in mid-September, just a few days before the new iPhones hit store shelves. Last year, it released iOS 18 on Monday, Sept. 16. Expect a confirmation of the release date at the iPhone 17 event, expected in early September. \niOS 26 features we're excited about\nLiquid Glass design: Your home screen is getting revamped with new app icons, including dark mode and all-clear options. You'll also notice buttons with a new floating design. Liquid Glass was designed to make all of Apple's OSes more cohesive.\nPhone app redesign: You'll finally be able to scroll through contacts, recent calls and voicemail messages all on one screen. It also comes with a new feature called Hold Assist that'll notify you when an agent comes to the phone so you can avoid the elevator music.\nLive Translate: iOS 26 is bringing the ability to have a conversation via phone call or text message with someone who speaks another language. Live Translate will translate your conversation in real time. \nPolls feature: Coming to group messages in the Messages app, chat members will be able to create polls. This can help prevent the unwanted 30+ messages when it comes to deciding which restaurant you're meeting at this weekend.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/ready-for-apples-ios-26-these-are-all-the-compatible-iphones-that-can-run-public-beta-2-right-now-191854071.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Apple is still hard at work on becoming a relevant player in AI. The latest missive from Mark Gurman at Bloomberg suggests that Apple is shifting its artificial intelligence goals to center on new device segments. Sources reportedly told the publication that Apple has a slate of new smart home products in the works that could help pivot its lagging AI strategy.\nThe center of the new lineup is a tabletop AI companion that has been described as an iPad on a movable robotic arm. It would be able to swivel to face the screen toward a user as they move around their home or office. Sources said the current prototype uses a horizontal display that's about seven inches while the motorized arm can move the screen about six inches away from the base in any direction. Equipped with a long-promised overhaul to the Siri voice assistant, this device could act like an additional person, recalling information, making suggestions and participating in conversations. According to Bloomberg, Apple is targeting a 2027 release for this product. \nApple's new lineup is also rumored to include a smart home hub that is a simpler version of the robotic friend with no moving stand. We might be seeing this sooner, with a projected 2026 release for the device. This hub device would be able to control music playback, take notes, browse the web and host videoconferencing. Both the robot companion and the smart home hub are reportedly running a new operating system called Charismatic that's designed to support multiple users. The Siri running on the device will be given a particularly cheery personality, and it may also be getting a visual representation. Bloomberg's sources said there hasn't been a final decision on aesthetics; internal tests have had Siri looking like an animated Finder icon and like a Memoji.\nToday's scuttlebutt follows on previous reports from Gurman that pointed to Apple's interest in these categories. The idea of a smart home hub was apparently floated at the company as far back as 2022, and it's finally being rumored to have a formal debut some time this year. Robots have also been a topic of interest in Cupertino for some time, with claims that Apple was developing a personal robot dating back at least to last spring. While this Bloomberg piece offers more detail about those hypothetical plans, there's always a chance Apple will change direction or scrap a project.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/apples-tabletop-robot-companion-rumored-for-2027-launch-204904807.html?src=rss",

You can also use the Waymo’s touchscreen to select from a variety of customized playlists that Spotify users will be familiar with, such as your “Daylist” or other mixes. That personalization may not be the main attraction for first-time users, but it could keep them coming back — and a loyal customer base is exactly what Waymo needs."

On July 5, Collison asked if Google Calendar users could get a Ctrl-click option that would allow them to easily duplicate events, similar to the feature that many native calendar applications already have. Collison tagged Pichai in his post at the time. While users often tag companies and CEOs with online feedback and complaints, you know you’ve made it when the CEO not only replies to you, but also implements the change you’ve asked for. That’s the case for Collison, at least. Wrote Pichai, “This feature is now live for everyone on Google Calendar on the web — thanks for the suggestion!” Naturally, some X users began to poke fun at Collison’s seeming influence by asking him to help with their own specific concerns, too. Joked Box CEO Aaron Levie, for example, referring to the notoriously congested highway that runs through Silicon Valley, where Waymo’s self-driving cars currently have limited availability, “John, can you ask Waymo to work on El Camino through the peninsula?

    "summary": "When Nintendo announced that it was adding GameCube games to its (inexplicably Switch 2-only) Nintendo Switch Online offering, people were understandably excited about the likes of Super Mario Sunshine and The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker joining the service. And I was one of them (even if I’d personally lose little sleep if Super Mario Sunshine was fired directly into the sun).\nBut as much as I want the obvious GameCube classics on my Switch 2, it’s the more underrated gems I’ve heard so much about from hardcore Nintendo fans over the years that really pique my interest. Games like Chibi-Robo!, for example, which Nintendo has confirmed as the next title joining the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion pack library on August 21.\nSay hello to Chibi-Robo!Join him on his quest to restore order to the Sanderson house and save the world in Chibi-Robo!, coming to Nintendo GameCube – Nintendo Classics on #NintendoSwitch2 for #NintendoSwitchOnline + Expansion Pack members on Aug 21! pic.twitter.com/BWjL2CbHdL— Nintendo of America (@NintendoAmerica) August 13, 2025\n\nChibi-Robo! is a 2005 platform-adventure game about a friendly little robot whose main goal is to help the Sanderson family by taking on various housework-related missions and performing generally good deeds on request. Chibi-Robo’s helpfulness isn’t limited to humans, though. In its quest to spread happiness, it also assists several animals and even enchanted toys along the way. As a player, you have to keep an eye on the robot’s battery life and use power outlets dotted around the house to recharge it. Fail to do so and it’ll collapse, and you’ll lose a chunk of the in-game currency you’ve collected.\nChibi-Robo! looks like a typically charming Nintendo game in every respect, but it was actually originally conceived by now-defunct developer Skip Ltd. as a point-and-click adventure game, with Bandai as the publisher. Exactly how or why the game ended up moving over to Nintendo remains a mystery, but director Kenichi Nishi told Time Extension that Shigeru Miyamoto took a particular liking to the character design. The legendary Mario creator then went on to play something of an overseer role in the game’s development under its new publisher.\nChibi-Robo! spawned a number of handheld spinoffs, but the original game remains the one with cult classic status. It’s also become increasingly hard to play over the years, with Nintendo choosing not to port the game forward. These days you can expect to pay as much as $200 for a second-hand physical copy. As someone who categorically does not have that kind of cash to chuck at a 20-year-old video game (or any game for that matter), I’m looking forward to seeing what all the fuss is about when it lands on Switch 2 next week.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/nintendo-is-putting-an-extremely-rare-gamecube-game-on-switch-2-next-week-171049667.html?src=rss",

Games like Chibi-Robo!, for example, which Nintendo has confirmed as the next title joining the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion pack library on August 21. pic.twitter.com/BWjL2CbHdL — Nintendo of America (@NintendoAmerica) August 13, 2025 is a 2005 platform-adventure game about a friendly little robot whose main goal is to help the Sanderson family by taking on various housework-related missions and performing generally good deeds on request. In its quest to spread happiness, it also assists several animals and even enchanted toys along the way. As a player, you have to keep an eye on the robot’s battery life and use power outlets dotted around the house to recharge it. looks like a typically charming Nintendo game in every respect, but it was actually originally conceived by now-defunct developer Skip Ltd. as a point-and-click adventure game, with Bandai as the publisher. Exactly how or why the game ended up moving over to Nintendo remains a mystery, but director Kenichi Nishi told Time Extension that Shigeru Miyamoto took a particular liking to the character design. As someone who categorically does not have that kind of cash to chuck at a 20-year-old video game (or any game for that matter), I’m looking forward to seeing what all the fuss is about when it lands on Switch 2 next week."

    "summary": "One thing I need to make clear right from the start: this is a review of Norton VPN (formerly Norton Secure VPN, and briefly Norton Ultra VPN) as a standalone app, not of the VPN feature in the Norton 360 package. They're similar, but Norton VPN has a few more features, including the ability to choose cities as server locations in countries with more than one option.\nI'll state my opinion up front. Norton VPN isn't a bad service, but it's not good enough to get ahead of its direct competitors. ExpressVPN, Surfshark, Proton VPN and NordVPN are all either faster, more feature-rich, more secure, more affordable or some combination of the four. There's no reason to go with Norton as your VPN unless you're getting it as part of another Norton 360 bundle. \nFor this review, I ran rigorous tests that highlighted Norton VPN's strengths (well-designed user interfaces, a verified privacy policy) along with its weaknesses (holes in its security, renewals that double the price, weak customer support). Norton's history of focusing on Windows means that app is by far the most complete; if you're on any other platform, expect to miss out on the best VPN protocols and the complete feature set.\nEditors' note: We're in the process of rebooting all of our VPN reviews from scratch. Once we do a fresh pass on the top services, we'll be updating each review with a rating and additional comparative information.\n \nTable of contents\n\nFindings at a glance\nInstalling, configuring and using Norton VPN\nNorton VPN speed test\nNorton VPN security test\nHow much does Norton VPN cost?\nNorton VPN side apps and bundles\nClose-reading Norton VPN's privacy policy\nCan Norton VPN change your virtual location?\nInvestigating Norton VPN's server network\nExtra features of Norton VPN\nNorton VPN customer support options\nNorton VPN background check\nFinal verdict\n\nFindings at a glance\nUse this table as a quick reference for my test results, investigations and thoughts about Norton VPN.

Its apps for Windows, Mac, Android, iOS and browsers are all similar, but there are distinctions in both design and features.\nWindows\nOnce you download the Norton VPN app from its website or the Microsoft Store, an installation wizard takes over and makes the rest of the process easy. You'll have to click to grant a few permissions and skip through a tutorial, but after that, you're free to move about the interface.\n\n\n\n\n   Sam Chapman for Engadget \n \n\nNorton VPN's Windows UI was a pleasant surprise. There's no wasted detail on the front page. Click the large yellow button to connect to the VPN, or select the server name to go to the location list, which is alphabetized. Clicking the very first entry in the list connects you to the fastest location. IP rotator servers and double VPN routes are grouped under tabs below that. There's no clutter and no aggressive popups, and connections happen quickly.\nYou'll find four tabs on the left-hand side of the Window. The top one manages the VPN. Then there's a store for other Norton products (IMO the only real misstep), a set of help pages and the controls for the VPN's settings and features. This last is subdivided into a row of easily understandable subtabs. I'm impressed by how seamlessly the design works in explanations of what each setting does — it makes the whole thing that much more accessible.\nMac\nDownloading Norton VPN for Mac is a quick and painless process, with one slight difference from Windows: you'll have to mess around a bit in System Preferences to give Norton the permissions it needs. Fortunately, the setup wizard guides you through the steps with text and animations.\n\n\n\n\n   Sam Chapman for Engadget \n \n\nThe actual interface is just as free of clutter as the Windows app — more so in some cases, as there's no shilling of the rest of the Norton family. The downside is that there's also no help center access from the main window; you have to go to Settings -> Troubleshooting to find the link. There also aren't links to specific help articles like the Windows app includes.\nAndroid\nOne word of warning about Norton VPN's mobile apps: you need an internet connection for the initial login and setup. It doesn't appear to be opening a website, but if you don't have web access, you'll get stuck in an endless loading loop.\nThe front pages of Norton VPN's desktop apps don't have many design elements, so the same general schematic is easy to compress onto mobile. The Android client has a status indicator, a large button to start your connection, tabs along the bottom and a gear icon for settings in the top-right. It's all intuitive and responsive.\n\n\n\n\n   Sam Chapman for Engadget \n \n\nIf I were to change anything, though, I'd take some of the options from the upper-right settings menu and swap them with the bottom tabs for notifications and accounts settings. VPN preferences should be accessible in one click, especially protocols. Frankly, the messages you get from this app aren't important enough to merit such pride of place.\niOS\nNorton VPN's apps for iPhone and iPad are almost identical to its Android app. The only real difference is that the iOS client is missing some features, most notably split tunneling; also, the kill switch is only available on the Mimic protocol, about which there's limited information. Other than that, it feels good to use. While it's not great that Apple users lose out on the full feature set, I can't deny it alleviates the problem of the VPN preferences menu feeling overstuffed.\n\n\n\n\n   Sam Chapman for Engadget \n \n\nBrowser extensions\nNorton VPN has browser extensions for Chrome, Firefox and Edge. The only reason to install any of these is to access the ad blocker, which doesn't come with either of the desktop apps. Other than that, it's an underwhelming extension. I recommend skipping it and going with a dedicated ad blocker instead — you'll get more customization features that way.\n\n\n\n\n   Sam Chapman for Engadget \n \n\nNorton VPN speed test\nUsing speedtest.net, I tested Norton VPN to see how much it slowed down my browsing speeds. I then calculated the results as percentages. While different networks give you different starting speeds, the same server location tends to slow down all those networks at about the same rate. You can use this table to estimate how much speed you can expect while Norton VPN is running.\nAs a reference, you generally need download speed for loading web pages and videos, upload speed for sending large amounts of data and latency for real-time communication. Latency always increases sharply over longer distances, but a good VPN can still keep the jumps under control. Let's see how Norton VPN did.\n\n\n\nServer location \nLatency (ms) \nIncrease factor \nDownload speed (Mbps) \nPercentage drop \nUpload speed (Mbps) \nPercentage drop \n\n\nPortland, OR, USA (unprotected) \n18 \n— \n58.90 \n— \n5.91 \n— \n\n\nPortland, OR, USA (protected) \n30 \n1.7x \n55.83 \n5.2 \n5.53 \n6.4 \n\n\nMcAllen, TX, USA \n164 \n9.1x \n48.96 \n16.9 \n5.70 \n3.6 \n\n\nArgentina \n422 \n23.4x \n43.02 \n27.0 \n5.72 \n3.2 \n\n\nCroatia \n379 \n21.1x \n46.35 \n21.3 \n5.65 \n4.4 \n\n\nNigeria \n564 \n31.3x \n39.94 \n32.2 \n3.86 \n34.7 \n\n\nIndonesia \n375 \n20.8x \n44.88 \n23.8 \n5.64 \n4.6 \n\n\nAverage \n322 \n17.9x \n46.50 \n21.1 \n5.35 \n9.5 \n\n\n\nBefore I interpret the results, I should mention that the algorithm Norton VPN uses to pick the fastest server doesn't seem to be reliable. Every time I clicked it, it gave me the server in Texas, thousands of miles from my real location in Portland, Oregon. Moreover, the Portland server was obviously faster. This happened repeatedly over multiple days of testing.\nTo the point: this table doesn't look good for Norton VPN. Download speeds dropped an average of 21.1 percent, the worst showing of any VPN I've tested so far. What's worse, the data clearly trend toward worse speeds at greater distances. Although it's true that distance impacts download speed as well as latency, it's also true that a well-implemented modern server OS should be able to render that effect minimal.\n\n\n\n\n   Sam Chapman for Engadget \n \n\nUpload speed looks better, with an average drop of under 10 percent — mainly dragged down by the Nigeria server, which cut speeds sharply across every test. Latency is also not awful. Controlling for the expected variance due to distance, Norton VPN beat out both Surfshark and NordVPN in average worldwide ping, which suggests that gaming may be its comfort zone.\nNorton VPN security test\nA VPN's primary job is to change your IP address. While doing this, it must also encrypt your communications with its servers so nobody can follow your connection home — this is what separates a VPN from a simple proxy. In this section, I'll run three checks to see whether Norton VPN can guarantee anonymous browsing.\nVPN protocols\nVPNs use protocols to establish stable connections between your devices and their servers. Most providers pick from the same pool of field-tested options, but you do see a surprise every now and then, like Norton VPN's Mimic.\nNorton VPN's protocol selection follows its general trend of serving very different experiences to users on different platforms. Windows and Android users get WireGuard, OpenVPN and Mimic, while macOS and iOS users only get Mimic and IKEv2. Here's a rundown of each.\n\nWireGuard is the most modern open-source VPN protocol currently available. It's almost always the fastest and uses a secure stream cipher for cryptography. The one downside is that it saves your real IP address to keep the connection open. Norton VPN deals with this by assigning temporary dynamic IP addresses during the authentication process.\nOpenVPN is an open source protocol that's been in use for ages. Its source code is slightly clunky after years of volunteers poking it for weaknesses, but that also makes it the most trustworthy option. It's fast on average, though usually slower than WireGuard or IKEv2.\nIKEv2 is a fast protocol that's good at reconnecting mobile devices as they move between networks. Norton VPN uses it in conjunction with IPSec encryption. If you're on an Apple device, it's your only option other than Mimic.\nMimic is an obfuscation protocol, which makes your VPN connection look like regular HTTPS traffic. This can get around networks that block all VPN traffic regardless of content. Mimic is based on TLS 1.3, and uses the same standard encryption algorithms as the other protocols.\n\nNormally, I advise letting your VPN choose what protocol is best. Norton VPN is different. There simply isn't enough information about Mimic for me to trust it, and you shouldn't let the VPN switch you to it without your knowledge. All the others are fine, though.\nLeak test\nTesting a VPN for leaks is easy: just check your IP address before and after connecting, and see if it changes. I used IPleak.net to run that test on several Norton VPN servers. I first observed that Norton VPN prevents IPv6 leaks by blocking IPv6 altogether. On every run, the IPv6 test failed to load, no matter which server location I chose. This is an effective way to make leaks impossible, since almost none of the internet is IPv6-only yet.\n\n\n\n\n   Sam Chapman for Engadget \n \n\nMy second conclusion was that Norton VPN's servers don't leak through DNS or WebRTC while your connection remains stable. However, every time I changed from one location to another, my real IP address was visible on the test screen for several seconds. Enabling the kill switch solved this problem, but the kill switch is not active by default, so make sure you turn it on in the settings.\n\n\n\n\n   Sam Chapman for Engadget \n \n\nThere is one other serious problem with this: on the iOS app, the kill switch cannot be used except with the Mimic protocol. This forces users to choose between leaving a hole in their security or trusting it to a protocol with limited transparency. Until this changes, I can't recommend installing Norton VPN on iOS at all.\nI tested the rotating IP server in the United States to see if it had the same problem, and thankfully didn't notice it. A Norton representative also confirmed that all servers have their own DNS resolvers that avoid public servers, cutting off a big source of leaks. Still, I'd recommend keeping the kill switch engaged. As long as you remember this, Norton VPN is secure.\nEncryption test\nFinally, I ran a test with WireShark to see if Norton VPN's protocols managed to encrypt my traffic. Since I've been uncertain about Mimic, I used it for the encryption test. I found that Mimic does in fact encrypt data packets, even on an unsecured HTTP connection. WireShark also confirmed to me that Mimic is using TLS for key exchange and encryption.\n\n\n\n\n   Sam Chapman for Engadget \n \n\nHow much does Norton VPN cost?\nNorton VPN subscriptions are only available for one year at a time — there's no monthly option. There are three different subscription tiers, summarized in the table below. \"Number of devices\" refers to how many devices you can have installed on a single account, whether or not any of them are connected to the VPN.\n\n\n\nSubscription \nStarting price (One year) \nRenewal price (One year) \nNumber of devices \nFeatures \n\n\nStandard \n$39.99 \n$79.99 \n5 \nBasic VPN service, IP rotation, double VPN, kill switch \n\n\nPlus \n$49.99 \n$109.99 \n5 \nAntivirus, password manager, dark web alerts, 10GB cloud backup \n\n\nUltimate \n$59.99 \n$129.99 \n10 \nParental controls, device locator \n\n\n\nThe Standard subscription is a reasonable price for what you get, but the superior Proton VPN is barely more expensive and Surfshark is actually cheaper. In other words, Norton VPN is a good price, but not great value — especially when you factor in the renewal prices, all of which force you to pay double or more what you paid the first time. If you'd like to decide for yourself, all the plans do come with a 60-day money-back guarantee.\nNorton VPN side apps and bundles\nNorton is better known as an antivirus company than a VPN provider, so naturally Norton VPN is packaged with the rest of the Norton 360 family. Be warned — unless you turn the option off in the Settings -> Privacy tab, Norton will collect information on your app usage and use it to target you with ads for its other products.\nNorton 360 is a massive product line encompassing dozens of individual subscriptions. To keep this section from bloating, I'll focus on the software available as part of an upgraded Norton VPN subscription, then end by listing the Norton 360 plans that include Norton VPN.\nFeatures on Norton VPN Plus\nA Norton VPN Plus subscription adds several features from Norton's antivirus suite, but isn't a complete replacement for Norton or any other dedicated antivirus software. Plus users get most of the antivirus features that work in real time, including a smart firewall, anti-ransomware backups, a sandbox for quarantining suspicious programs and a malicious script blocker.\nVPN subscribers do not get access to the quicker Smart Scan option, instead getting a different scan feature that checks for online threats (note that the FAQ page about this erroneously says Norton VPN includes Smart Scan). VPN users also miss out on the LiveUpdate feature that installs security patches autonomously, plus the automated hard drive cleaner.\nFeatures on Norton VPN Ultimate\nIn addition to raising the device limit to 10, Norton VPN Ultimate adds two features on top of Plus: parental controls and Privacy Monitor. The latter is only available in the US and Canada.\nParental control is both a time-based site blocker and a monitoring app. It can not only track a child's internet activity, but also their physical location, giving you alerts if they leave set boundaries during a certain time (say school property during a weekday). Privacy Monitor scans for your information on data brokerage sites so you can send deletion requests, similar to Surfshark Incogni.\nNorton 360 plans that include Norton VPN\nInstead of subscribing to Norton VPN directly, you can also pick a Norton 360 plan that includes VPN service. Norton 360 Standard and Norton 360 For Gamers each let you install Norton VPN on three devices. Norton 360 Deluxe raises that number to five, while Norton 360 with Lifelock Select and Norton 360 with Lifelock Advantage grant you 10 total VPN installs. Norton 360 with Lifelock Ultimate Plus lets you install Norton VPN on an unlimited number of devices.\nClose-reading Norton VPN's privacy policy\nTo assess Norton VPN's privacy, we need to look at two different privacy policies. Like I said in the introduction, there are technically two products called Norton VPN — the standalone service I've been reviewing and the VPN features of the Norton 360 bundle. I've been focused on the independent Norton VPN so far, but since the Norton 360 VPN add-on is a privacy risk, I want to mention it here.\nNorton lists the privacy policies for each of its products on one page of its website. The VPN feature of Norton 360 is governed by the top two policies, Norton Security Products (desktop) and Norton 360 Mobile Apps. The standalone Norton VPN has its own policy further down the page.\nThe Norton 360 policy is a privacy nightmare. Both the desktop and mobile apps claim the right to save your IP address, device fingerprints and web activity for up to 36 months, and there's no exception for the VPN feature. I strongly advise against using Norton 360's bundled VPN for any activity you don't want Norton seeing.\nFortunately, Norton holds the standalone VPN to a much more acceptable set of rules. It isn't permitted to collect IP addresses, browsing history or DNS requests, nor can it share any of the data it does collect with partners. The partners note is important because one of Norton's sibling companies, Avast, is known to have sold information on its users to corporations for ad targeting. A Norton representative stated that Avast is no longer involved in harvesting or selling user data. More importantly, he said that no data from VPN products is shared between Gen Digital brands.\nIndependent privacy audits\nA recent audit by penetration testing firm VerSprite provides reason to be hopeful about Norton VPN's privacy. According to a report published in August 2024, which you can download from this page, VerSprite found that Norton VPN posed an overall \"low\" privacy risk, judged on a scale of low, medium, high and critical risks.\nDuring their audit, VerSprite informed Norton that certain conditions could make VPN users identifiable. In a second round of tests, Norton appears to have fixed those vulnerabilities. That's certainly reassuring, but I wish the report — which only runs three pages in all — was more specific about what the problem actually was. Regardless, the VerSprite audit is a good sign that Norton VPN is taking privacy more seriously than Norton as a whole.\nCan Norton VPN change your virtual location?\nIf a VPN can change your virtual location, it can not only throw ISPs and other interlopers off your real identity, but also change what you see on the internet — especially on streaming sites, where connecting through a different country can unlock new shows. However, Netflix and its brethren block VPN traffic for copyright reasons, so it's never a guarantee that you'll get in.\n\n\n\n\n   Sam Chapman for Engadget \n \n\nI tested Norton VPN's ability to unblock Netflix on five different locations, connecting three times on three different servers in each place. I set the app to automatically choose the protocol. In the table below, you'll see how many tests each location passed, and whether Netflix showed new content each time. If I get into Netflix but the library doesn't change, that indicates the server might be leaky.\n\n\n\nServer location \nUnblocked Netflix? \nChanged content? \n\n\nVancouver, Canada \n3/3 \n3/3 \n\n\nIceland \n0/3 \n0/3 \n\n\nLatvia \n3/3 \n3/3 \n\n\nMorocco \n3/3 \n3/3 \n\n\nPhilippines \n3/3 \n3/3 \n\n\n\nI had no problems in four out of five of the locations I tested, but Netflix utterly defeated the Iceland servers. No matter how many times I disconnected and reconnected to get a new IP address, Netflix recognized a VPN server and blocked me. This happened even when I switched to the Mimic protocol.\n\n\n\n\n   Sam Chapman for Engadget \n \n\nThat indicates that Netflix has blocklisted most or all of Norton VPN's servers in Iceland, and the company hasn't caught up. It's another troubling indication that Norton isn't committing the level of attention that its server network requires.\nInvestigating Norton VPN's server network\nSpeaking of the server network, now's the time to get deeper into it. The relative scarcity of different IP addresses on Norton VPN, along with the download speed drops over long distances, suggest to me that Norton might have relegated maintaining VPN data centers to an afterthought. So, let's see what its worldwide server selection looks like.\n\n\n\nRegion \nCountries with servers \nTotal server locations \n\n\nNorth America \n5 \n32 \n\n\nSouth America \n6 \n6 \n\n\nEurope \n36 \n47 \n\n\nAfrica \n5 \n5 \n\n\nMiddle East \n2 \n2 \n\n\nAsia \n10 \n10 \n\n\nOceania \n2 \n4 \n\n\nTotal \n66 \n106 \n\n\n\nAll of Norton VPN's server locations are physical, with no virtual locations. This makes its network more reliable — virtual server locations can deliver unexpected speed swings. However, it does limit the number of locations Norton is capable of offering.\nThe selection is reasonably good, with many locations in often-underserved Africa and South America, and many options in marquee regions like the US and Europe. However, it's a pretty small network for what Norton is charging. Also, as we saw with the Iceland location getting blocked by Netflix, having a country on the menu doesn't necessarily mean it will do the job.\nExtra features of Norton VPN\nNorton VPN added a ton of features in the first several months of 2025. Most of these mainly brought it up to par with other VPNs, like city-level region selection or support for smart TVs. However, there are one or two you won't find in many other places, like the IP rotator — to my knowledge, nobody else has that except Surfshark. Here are the most important extras to know about.\nAd blocker\nNorton VPN's ad blocker can be used on its browser extension. Its mobile apps can block the trackers embedded in ads, but not the ads themselves. There's not a lot of customization potential; you can turn it on and off, and that's mainly it. The one option you have on the extension is to turn \"acceptable ads\" back on. This can help you get into sites that normally block users with adblock on, or use sites where you want to see ads to help them monetize.\n\n\n\n\n   Sam Chapman for Engadget \n \n\nDouble VPN and IP rotator\nNorton introduced these two features in 2025 as \"enhanced anonymity\" upgrades. Double VPN runs your VPN through two server locations instead of one, so you're still safe if one server breaks down. You can choose from eight pre-determined multi-hop paths with endpoints in the USA, the UK, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Japan, Germany and Taiwan.\n\n\n\n\n   Sam Chapman for Engadget \n \n\nIP rotation servers change your IP address frequently while you're connected, which makes you harder to track. Unlike Surfshark, which lets you turn this on everywhere, Norton VPN limits you to six IP rotator locations: the USA, the UK, Canada, Japan, Germany and Australia.\nConvenience features\nThe next three features were also added in the last eight months. The server location menu now puts your last five locations at the top for easy retrieval. While connected to a server, you can pause the VPN for 15, 30 or 60 minutes, after which it turns back on. Finally, the mobile apps have added a home screen widget so you can operate the VPN without opening the app.\n\n\n\n\n   Sam Chapman for Engadget \n \n\nKill switch\nA VPN kill switch cuts off your internet access if you lose your VPN connection, so any sensitive information isn't broadcast unprotected. Norton VPN's kill switch is vital, since it appears to briefly drop encryption while switching server locations. Unfortunately, it's not available on iOS.\nSplit tunneling\nThe Windows and Android apps for Norton VPN allow split tunneling, in which only certain apps go through the VPN while others connect directly. Norton uses app-based split tunneling, but if you want to protect or remove protection from specific URLs, you can use two different web browsers.\nWi-Fi security\nThis feature, which appears on NortonVPN's mobile apps only, activates whenever you connect to a Wi-Fi network. Norton VPN scans that network for common attacks launched over Wi-Fi, like DNS poisoning and SSL stripping, and sends you an alert if it detects any.\nP2P optimization\nNorton VPN has certain servers in its network configured for torrenting. You can't use it for torrenting outside those locations — if you try, the VPN will disconnect. To connect to a P2P server, just select \"P2P-optimized region\" from the server menu. You can't choose a torrenting server in a specific region; the app just selects the fastest.\nNorton VPN customer support options\nFollowing the broad trend of Norton VPN, the Windows app gets most of the love, having much more in-app support than any other platform. Mac users get a troubleshooting tab in the settings menu, with three options: go to the online help center, send a bug report or go to the community forum. iOS and Android just have a \"help and support\" button on the accounts page that sends you straight to the website.\nOn Windows, there's a separate help and support tab above the settings tab, which gives you direct links to some of the most important pages on the Norton website. It's also got links to the forum and help center. Then there's the same troubleshooting tab as the Mac app, but with more options. Windows users can reset the app to default, record a problem to get more specific help, send debug logs and run an automated \"Repair Norton\" process.\nIf you got to the website through a desktop app, it's surprisingly difficult to get to the general support page for Norton VPN — Windows links to a splintered set of FAQ pages, while Mac sends you to a Mac-specific page for the entire Norton Family. I recommend just going to support.norton.com in your browser, then clicking the Norton VPN button. At least the links in both mobile apps take you straight there.\nOnce you have gotten to the Norton VPN support page, you won't find much of use. Help articles are limited and leave some big holes. For example, all connectivity problems are limited to a page called \"Fix problem accessing the internet when connected to Norton VPN.\" The only advice for Windows, Mac and Android is to choose a different VPN protocol, and there's nothing at all for iOS.\nEven worse, whenever you use the search bar to look anything up, you're forced to watch an AI answer type itself out in real time, so links to the actual help pages are constantly jumping around as you try to click on them. It's this feature that pushes Norton's help pages from negligent to hostile.\nLive support experience\nThere are a few other ways to get support from Norton VPN. You can check in on the community forum, chat live with an agent or call their phone line. The forums are reasonably active for Windows, but pretty dead for all other platforms.\nI used live chat to ask about a problem with installing the iOS app. I managed to reach a human pretty quickly, but there were several long pauses during our conversation. Eventually, they escalated my case to a higher support team.\n\n\n\n\n   Sam Chapman for Engadget \n \n\nI assumed that this team would send me an email, per standard practice. Instead, they repeatedly tried to reach me by phone. I was not warned that they would do this, and each time, the call was flagged as spam. By the time I realized Norton was calling me, I'd already solved the problem myself. Be aware of this if you plan to contact Norton with a difficult issue.\nNorton VPN background check\nThe Norton software brand has existed in some form or another since the Norton Utilities package was developed for DOS in 1982. The brand was acquired in 1990 by Symantec, which had published its own first antivirus program the year before. Symantec began releasing Norton Antivirus in 1991, and continued distributing it until its merger with Avast in 2022. Since then, the combined company has been called Gen Digital.\nCompared to that long history, Norton VPN has only been around for a blip. It launched in 2019 as part of Symantec's bid to expand the Norton Antivirus line into a suite that could defend against more types of threats. As such, while Norton and Symantec have been involved in their share of controversies over the years, very few of them happened during Norton VPN's lifetime.\nDespite Norton's long and checkered history, checking the background of its VPN is pretty simple: nothing has gone seriously wrong yet. This VPN has problems, but they're mainly out in the open, stemming from it being a relative afterthought from a company more focused on other types of security.\nFinal verdict\nFor me to recommend a VPN, it has to stand out in a crowded field. After a week of working with Norton VPN, I have to conclude that the only way it distinguishes itself is the Norton name. For everything else it does, a competitor does it better. Surfshark scoops it on IP rotation and multihop, ExpressVPN has better protocols, NordVPN is faster and Proton VPN's ad blocker works in more places.\nOne thing I will say in Norton VPN's favor is that it's working to rectify all this. In the last year, it's added a lot of features. The problem is that most of those are options I'd have expected it to have already, such as city-level region selection and a kill switch on Mac. It's catching up, not innovating.\nIt's also nice that you can use the bundles to roll more Norton products into one subscription. However, since Norton is much more experienced at developing other sorts of security software, I'd advise going the Norton 360 route if you're interested in those other features and treating the VPN as an add-on. Norton VPN is a side dish, not an entree.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/norton-vpn-review-a-vpn-that-fails-to-meet-nortons-standards-170037086.html?src=rss",
    "full_text": "Norton VPN isn't a bad service, but it's not good enough to get ahead of its direct competitors. One word of warning about Norton VPN's mobile apps: you need an internet connection for the initial login and setup. I recommend skipping it and going with a dedicated ad blocker instead — you'll get more customization features that way. Latency always increases sharply over longer distances, but a good VPN can still keep the jumps under control. My second conclusion was that Norton VPN's servers don't leak through DNS or WebRTC while your connection remains stable. If you'd like to decide for yourself, all the plans do come with a 60-day money-back guarantee. Privacy Monitor scans for your information on data brokerage sites so you can send deletion requests, similar to Surfshark Incogni. Most of these mainly brought it up to par with other VPNs, like city-level region selection or support for smart TVs. Norton VPN's kill switch is vital, since it appears to briefly drop encryption while switching server locations. Despite Norton's long and checkered history, checking the background of its VPN is pretty simple: nothing has gone seriously wrong yet."

    "full_text": "Pocket FM already uses some AI tools like ElevenLabs to generate voices for audio series. Now we can do this in less than three months,” Nayak said. As a result of adopting different AI features internally, Pocket FM has been able to scale the content quickly. The company is already working on tools to convert stories into comic strips with its Pocket Toons platform. Pocket FM has already laid off people who were employees or contractors across multiple rounds in the last 12 months. The company noted that every piece of content is reviewed by its AI-powered moderation framework to ensure quality and originality. Another concern is that writers could become overly dependent on AI over time. In Germany, AI is writing more content than humans per show for select titles. With Pocket FM’s plans to roll out more AI tools, the amount of AI-written content could increase. That is they could make targeted improvements, instead of doing a full rewrite."

Migicovsky’s company, Core Devices, had also shown off early ideas for the watches back in March, but today it’s revealing the final design for the Pebble Time 2. The industrial design of the watch has changed, and a handful of new features have been added, notes Migicovsky in a blog post. The Time 2 will debut in four colors, still yet to be determined; Pebble buyers will have input later on, the company says. Plus, the company is adding a multicolor RGB LED backlight, a second microphone (to aid with a potential environmental noise-cancellation feature), a compass sensor, and a screw-mounted back cover. The watch will be stainless steel on the front and back and will feature stainless steel buttons like the older Pebble Time Steel. Other previously announced specs will remain the same, including Pebble’s plans for a 1.5-inch 64 color e-paper display, a touch screen, a quick-release 22 mm watch strap, a flat hardened glass lens, a 30-day estimated battery life, a heart rate monitor, step and sleep tracking, a speaker, a linear actuator motor (for vibration), and a waterproof rating of some sort, which is yet to be determined. The Pebble Time 2 is available for preorder for $225 and will pair with a smartphone via Bluetooth, allowing it to display notifications, control the music on your phone, and connect with the internet. The company also noted that people who preorder the Core 2 Duo can upgrade to the Pebble Time 2 while reserving their place in line. To do so, customers shouldn’t cancel the original order, but instead wait for an email survey link that will be sent in the next month or so, offering the option for them to catch their order."

    "summary": "Since the original Tamagotchi landed on store shelves 28 years ago, not much has changed in the world of virtual pets. The basic gameplay remains, with players being asked to feed, groom and play with small digital creatures inside a handheld device. But new features have also been added, like Bluetooth connectivity and downloadable content (they're also a little bigger than before). This month, however, Hasbro is throwing its hat into the ring with the Nano-Mals, a $20 device that takes the standard features of a virtual pet and aims them toward a new purpose: fidget toy.\nThe first thing you’ll probably notice when you pick up one of the eight initial Nano-Mals models is how cute they all are: they’re styled after both common and uncommon animals, including two cows, two cats, a red panda, a narwhal, and a pair of unicorns.But the second thing you’ll notice is that there’s no screen to be found anywhere; instead, the sole “display” is a a light-up heart on the front of the toy that has three levels and changes color to indicate how satiated the toy is in terms of hunger, affection and play. \nHow you fulfill these needs is where the Nano-mals distinguish themselves from other virtual pets: Instead of pushing buttons and navigating through various menus, you interact instead with the various parts of the toy directly. Push down on its ear to “pet” it, flip its arms to “dance” and push its nose to “feed” it. The more you perform these actions, the more each color of the heart will fill up, eventually resulting in a rainbow kaleidoscope across the toy’s chest.\nIt’s incredibly easy to do, not just because these are simple actions, but because they’re engineered to be satisfying since it is a fidget toy. It feels good to flip the arms up and down and squish the ears. Not so much for pushing the shallow nose button though, meaning it was often the need that took the longest for me to fulfill. It just wasn’t fun to push the nose! I can only hope that future iterations improve on this.\nOnce you’ve figured out the basic functions, it becomes a game in itself to figure out the best way to hold and interact with the device. You don’t need to look at it and the entire thing can be operated with one hand, which is exactly what you want in a fidget toy. I found myself rotating it between my fingers while flipping the arms – the device also contains an accelerometer so any significant movement also counts as “play.”\nIf you have more than one Nano-mal – which is quite likely given the device’s low price – the toys will interact with each other, lighting up and talking to each other. It’s cute but also a bit unsettling, as it was very reminiscent of this year’s Black Mirror episode “Playthings” with the Nano-mals emitting mysterious bleats and chimes just like the Thronglets. Fortunately, there is an off switch, and the Nano-mals will burble happily before shutting down when you use it.\n\n\n\n\n   Kris Naudus for Engadget \n \n\nHowever, the off switch isn’t absolute as, should you press any of the buttons, the Nano-mal will still react, though maybe not effusively as if the device were powered fully on. This is a problem given that the Nano-mal is meant to be taken out and about (there’s even a clip at the top), but will likely be banned from classrooms due to the possibility of it being accidentally triggered when a kid moves their stuff. The toys can be muted by holding down the nose for a few seconds, but it only works when the device is fully powered on, and resets every time the Nano-mal is turned off and on.\nAside from that and the fact that I couldn’t remove the attachment clip, which got in the way when I was trying to spin the device in my hand, I think the Nano-mal is a solid first try at this kind of toy. Kids will love how cute they are, especially when you dress them up in the included clothes, which double as protective cases for the devices. And adults will appreciate them too: Parents are big on screen-free devices, while the young-at-heart will appreciate having something to keep their hands busy that isn’t their phone.\nThe Nano-mals are available now at all major toy retailers, including Walmart and Amazon.\n \nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/hasbros-nano-mals-are-a-virtual-pet-that-rewards-fidgeting-141553387.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "At WWDC 2025, Apple announced it was replacing the sequential numbering for OS versions and with year numbers. So instead of watchOS 12, I’ve spent the past two weeks with the public beta of watchOS 26. The naming scheme shift is subtle, but helpful — which is how I’d describe the upgrades the new software brings to the Apple Watch. The AI-powered Workout Buddy better contextualizes your Fitness data and an added gesture gives the watch a fun trick that’s actually helpful. Other upgrades — including better smart replies and the Liquid Glass treatment — all combine to make the watch work and look a bit better than it did before. It’s not a game-changing shift, like other OS 26 releases, but it manages to make a great watch a touch better.\nLuminous Liquid Glass\nEvery Apple operating system got the Liquid Glass treatment this year, including watchOS 26. The change is less noticeable on the Apple Watch than on the iPhone or iPad, though. You’ll notice the semi-transparent buttons and flowy movement when entering your password and opening the control center — the icons look like they’re surrounded in little drops of water, which is quite pretty. You’ll see it on the Photos watch face, too, especially if you select the “glass” color for the time readout. \nThe Liquid Glass treatment for the Photos watch face. Amy Skorheim for Engadget\nThe Smart Stack now has a liminal glow and the app icons are likewise a touch more luminous than before. The effect is subtle and nicely unifies the look of the watch and its companion iPhone. Like all design upgrades, Liquid Glass made me feel like I was using a new watch — though, like everything, the novelty wore off after a week or two.\nRevamped Workout app combines AI stats with a DJ\nIn addition to the Buddy, the Workout app has a new look with icons in each of the four corners of the screen that give you easier access to adjust your data view, play music, set goals and tweak Buddy settings. My favorite new feature is in the music menu and it’s limited to Apple Music for now. If you tap the music icon, you have the option to auto-play music. From there, you can also select “Picked for you” or “Choose media.” The former will select music that matches the type of workout you’re doing and what you like to listen to. As someone who gets derailed from pretty much all my tasks when I have to interact with my phone, I appreciate anything that can make decisions for me and prevent me from reaching for it.\nI was presented with peppy beats that matched the cadence of my run, from bands and artists that were familiar as well as new-to-me selections that fit my tastes. Unfortunately, it didn’t always work correctly. Sometimes I’d get no music, other times the music would play but the Workout Buddy would fall silent. I realize I’m testing a public beta of watchOS 26, so I’m holding out hope the feature will work at launch. Because when it worked, it was glorious.\nThe new Workout app layout. Amy Skorheim for Engadget\nThe new Workout Buddy is probably the biggest AI play in watchOS 26. It uses historical and real-time data collected by your watch to give you a window into how you’re performing at the beginning, end and throughout a workout. It works for walking, running, cycling and other workouts but requires headphones and a nearby Apple Intelligence-compatible iPhone. That gave me pause. I hate carrying stuff and/or sticking things in my ears when I run. But after acquiring some open earbuds and digging out my old Spibelt, I made it work.\nThere are three voices to choose from as of this writing, a bright feminine option, a British male-sounding one and another female-presenting version with a lower register. These were built on vocal data from Fitness+ trainers and have an authentic sound to them. At the start of a workout, you’ll get a brief pep talk along with some recent milestones. My pre-game walking and running talks included references to the day of the week, my location and accumulated fitness data. For example, “Way to get out there on a Wednesday morning walk in Albuquerque. So far this week, you’ve done three walking workouts. Let’s get in some steps!”\nDepending on the type of exercise, you can set target ranges for cadence, heart rate, speed, distance, power (cycling), time and others. During a workout, the AI will let you know if you’re at, below or above those levels. The first time I tried Workout Buddy, my run was quite lonely. I didn’t realize I had to turn on the Buddy, as well as the various goal metrics within the Workout app. I did that and, on my next run, the AI delivered cadence and heart rate updates, and let me know when I hit milestones like distance and duration.\nAt the end of a workout, you’ll see a thinking animation as the AI assembles a summary. It’ll recap data like your pace, distance, average and peak heart rate, as well as progress on your Activity rings. It’ll also point out comparisons or cumulative milestones you may have hit. For example, after a longer walk, it told me that I’d just burned the most calories on a walk so far. Another day, it told me I’d walked ten miles so far this week. It closes the update by encouraging you to take the energy into the rest of your day or something similarly positive but measured.\nThat’s a big improvement over the first few times I used the feature. My first few pep talks were cloying, telling me something along the lines of “It’s not easy to get out there early in the morning!” and “Your effort is inspiring!\" After I stopped a run early to fuss with settings, it told me I did a “Great job!” on a three-minute run. Thankfully, Apple appears to be tweaking the Buddy behind the scenes, calibrating the AI’s “personality.” Recent pep talks have become noticeably less sycophantic and therefore more enjoyable. I imagine the Buddy will only continue to evolve even more from here.\nThe Workout Buddy is not a coach\nThe Workout Buddy is a motivational experience that provides personalized insights you can use to gauge your performance. But I just finished trying out Samsung’s AI running coach on the Galaxy Watch and couldn’t help comparing the two. That coach pushed me to run five kilometers for the first time in my life. The Buddy made me feel like I’d accomplished something special just by taking my dog on a stroll. Both have their place, but I’d say Apple’s version is probably best for those who already know what their goals are and what they need to do to hit them. Samsung’s version may be better for beginners who want some help shaping their fitness journey.\nIn addition to the Buddy, the Workout app has a new look with icons in each of the four corners of the screen that give you easier access to adjust your data view, play music, set goals and tweak Buddy settings. My favorite new feature is in the music menu and it’s limited to Apple Music for now. If you tap the music icon, you have the option to auto-play music. From there, you can also select “Picked for you” or “Choose media.” The former will select music that matches the type of workout you’re doing and what you like to listen to. As someone who gets derailed from pretty much all my tasks when I have to interact with my phone, I appreciate anything that can make decisions for me and prevent me from reaching for it.\nI was presented with peppy beats that matched the cadence of my run, from bands and artists that were familiar as well as new-to-me selections that fit my tastes. Unfortunately, it didn’t always work correctly. Sometimes I’d get no music, other times the music would play but the Workout Buddy would fall silent. I realize I’m testing a public beta of watchOS 26, so I’m holding out hope the feature will work at launch. Because when it worked, it was glorious.\nMore hands-free fun with wrist flick\nI love the double tap gesture Apple introduced with the Apple Watch Series 9 — it’s a pleasure to stop timers, start auto-detected workouts and answer calls without getting my other hand involved. But it took some practice before I could reliably get the watch to recognize the gesture. (The trick is raising your wrist in an exaggerated checking-the-time motion then quickly, but not too quickly, tapping your thumb and finger together twice.)\nLuckily, the new Wrist Flick motion introduced in watchOS 26 takes practically no effort to get right. It involves quickly turning the back of your wrist away from you and back up again. Doing that can silence a call, stop a ringing timer, dismiss notifications and return you to the watch face from any app you open. It also makes those irritating helpful “Time to stand!” reminders go away. The wrist flick doesn’t clear alerts, just dismisses them — so the red indicator dot disappears, but the notification remains and you can see it if you swipe down. Just note that it’s only available to Apple Watch Series 9, 10 and the Ultra 2.\nAmy Skorheim for Engadget\nWrist flick is a great feature — though it's important to note that Android wearables since WearOS 2 had a similar feature for a while now. And I’d like to see Apple adopt more hands-free interactions like this. Apple already has many gesture-based controls as part of its existing AssistiveTouch feature. Actions like fist clenches, wrist tilts and single or double taps can control most of the navigation on the watch. Unfortunately, turning on AssistiveTouch turns off the universal double tap feature. I’d be interested in seeing something that splits the difference. Perhaps four or five gestures for basic functions that can be used in conjunction with screen input.\nSmarter replies could make Messages a usable watch app\nThe Apple Watch is great for reading texts, but replying is awkward. That tiny keyboard is an interface for ants — even talk-to-text input is inefficient as it’s tough to correct mistakes. Smart Replies are little canned responses that appear as suggestions below the reply field. Those aren’t new, but now Series 9 watches and later will use an improved on-device language model to come up with relevant bits of text you can send with a tap.\nIn addition to the choices that are always offered — Okay, Yes, No, Thank you and Can I call you later? — I saw things like “Ok, let me know” and “That’s so sweet!” both of which applied to their respective conversations. I wasn’t always given Smart Reply suggestions, and some of them weren’t very relevant, but again, it’s a great feature that will save time when it works.\nAnother Messages update is a carryover from iOS 26 (and borrowed from countless other messaging apps). You can now set custom backgrounds for each of your (Apple-only) contacts. Just note that whatever you set will be seen by all participants in the conversation, once they update to iOS 26. On your watch, the photo, gradient or pattern you pick carries over to your conversations. Not only does it look nice, I find backgrounds help me to not accidentally text my mom something I meant to send to my sister.\nBackgrounds are now available in Messages. Amy Skorheim for Engadget\nNotes have arrived\nThe Notes app is now on Apple Watch. I honestly hadn’t noticed the lack before this — I know there are plenty of Notes enthusiasts out there, but in my world, Alexa handles all reminder and shopping list duties. Still, I can see how the new integration could come in handy. After creating a simple shopping checklist in the iOS Notes app, I opened the list on my watch while I was shopping and found it far easier to check things off on my wrist than dragging out my phone every time I stuck something in my cart.\nI’m curious to see whether Apple’s improved prediction algorithms for the new OS will eventually add Notes to my Smart Stack suggestions after I open the Notes app a few times at the grocery store. As it stands now, the Notes widget will pop up first in the Smart Stack if that’s the last app you used.\nThe rest of the new stuff\nFace Gallery\nThe iPhone Watch app has a new look and now organizes watch faces by category instead of by name. Groupings include New, Clean, Data-rich, Photos and Health and Fitness, among others. It’s certainly an improvement, but one that makes you wonder why it wasn’t always like this.\nThe Watch Face gallery is categorized now.Amy Skorheim for Engadget\nAdaptive sound\nAnother nice-but-obvious update adjusts the volume of pings and beeps to fit the environment — quieter in a noiseless office and louder at a raucous BBQ. I set a timer to go off when I was quietly working at my desk and then again with loud music playing and I couldn’t really tell the difference. But that’s a hard metric for the humble human ear to judge. Again, this is a feature reserved for Series 9 models and later.\nSmart Stack\nThe Smart Stack will now add a small prompt to your watch face when it detects certain situations. For example, if you open the camera app on your phone, a small camera icon appears at the bottom of your watch screen, as a suggestion to open the remote shutter. Apple gives other examples, such as showing the workout icon when you arrive at your usual pilates studio or the Backtrack navigation feature when you journey away from cellular connectivity.\nI didn’t see the prompt very often, but I did notice that the Smart Stack rearranged itself according to my habits — such as putting the medication widget at the top of the stack right around the time it was time to take my prescription, or shuffling Shazam to the top when it hears music playing.\nSiri is still Siri\nComing fresh off of reviewing the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8, I can’t help but notice a stark difference between that wearable’s fully integrated, AI-powered Gemini and Apple’s same-old Siri. Gemini on the Samsung watch helped me find new stuff in my city, performed convoluted tasks and answered some pretty esoteric questions. I use Siri on my watch to reliably set timers, text people and add events to my calendar. But it’s not quite on the level of Gemini’s contextually-aware, generative capabilities that can interact with multiple apps. Asking something like “Where should I have lunch?” gave me a list of businesses with lunch in the name followed by Siri asking me: “Which one?” Not sure what that meant. Gemini, on the other hand, gave me local and relevant ideas for places I’d actually want to eat.\nEven before AI swallowed everyone’s mind, I had a soft spot for digital assistants. When Alexa sings the “You’re very, very, oh so very welcome” song, I get a dopey smile on my face. I’ve tried to love Siri, but I get frustrated by being misunderstood, misdirected, misheard and flat-out ignored. I know Apple doesn’t like to release new tech until it’s fully up to snuff, and I’m looking forward to seeing what finally happens with new Siri. But for now, the disparity shows.\nWrap-up\nThe changes watchOS 26 brings to the Apple Watch are perhaps not as grand as those for other Apple devices. Liquid Glass here isn’t as all-encompassing as it is on the iPhone. The new watch features don’t make the wearable finally realize its full potential like iPad OS 26 does for the tablet. And there isn’t one major feature upgrade that transforms the watch experience, like macOS 26 does with Spotlight on Macs.\nBut the updates do push the experience of using the watch forward. Liquid Glass is pretty and nicely ties the wearable with its companion devices. The Workout app, which was already good at tracking fitness metrics, is even better with the Workout Buddy, providing stat summaries and automated playlists. Improved smart replies for Messages and the addition of the Notes app fix two of the watch’s previous shortcomings. And the wrist flick adds another option for hands-free interaction and — I hope — is a precursor to more such utility. I’m still holding out hope for an improved, personable and helpful Siri once Apple is ready, but for now, these are all welcome upgrades for what’s already the industry’s best overall smartwatch.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wearables/watchos-26-preview-its-the-little-things-140035949.html?src=rss",

It's a good deal for anyone who wants to take advantage of the Switch 2's camera functionality in games like Mario Kart World and that recently-released campfire sim.\nThis was designed specifically for Nintendo's new console, so it's a plug-and-play affair.

The pot the Piranha Plant sits in functions as both a stand and USB extension for the device. The plant itself detaches from the pot, so the camera can be used in portable mode by popping it into the USB port at the top of the console.\nThere's also a built-in privacy shutter. Just close the plant's mouth to obscure the lens. The actual camera specs here aren't going to win any awards, with a frame rate of 30FPS and a resolution of 640 x 480p.

    "full_text": "Even though the Switch 2 basically just came out, we're already starting to see discounts on some of its accessories. One of the more charming peripherals, the HORI Piranha Plant camera, is on sale right now for only $40. That's $20 off and a record-low price. It's a good deal for anyone who wants to take advantage of the Switch 2's camera functionality in games like Mario Kart World and that recently-released campfire sim. It's a Piranha Plant from the Mario franchise. We called it a \"work of art\" upon encountering the device and that holds true today. This thing is not only stylish, resembling an Amiibo more than a camera, but it's downright useful.

Kwon's story is a wild one involving an immense crypto crash, an Interpol manhunt and Kwon's eventual extradition from Montenegro to the United States. \nKwon, along with Sam Bankman-Fried and others, was a key player in 2022's crypto collapse. His company Terraform created a \"stablecoin\" called TerraUSD supposedly pegged to the US dollar, along with a floating crypto coin called Luna. When TerraUSD fell below its $1 peg in May of 2021, Kwon secretly arranged for a trading firm to buy the currency to boost its price. However, he lied to investors and said he stabilized the coin using a specialized algorithm. \nThose investors believed the story and bought up Luna (closely tied to TerraUSD), to the tune of nearly $50 billion, according to US prosecutors. Both currencies subsequently collapsed, taking $40 billion of investor money with it. As it often works with such things, many regular people lost their life savings, while venture capital firms profited before the rug was pulled. \nFollowing the collapse, Kwon was put on wanted lists in both the US and South Korea, with investigators in the latter country enlisting Interpol to find the entrepreneur. He subsequently posted on X that he \"wasn't on the run\" and was extradited to the US last year on New Year's Eve. \nKwon was originally charged with nine counts including securities fraud, wire fraud, commodities fraud and money-laundering conspiracy. Though facing up to 25 years, he may receive a reduced sentence of 12 years maximum provided he accepts responsibility for his crimes. \"I made false and misleading statements about why [TerraUSD] regained its peg by failing to disclose a trading firm’s role in restoring that peg,” Kwon said. “What I did was wrong.”\nEarlier, Kwon agreed to pay an $80 million civil fine and be banned from crypto transactions as part of a $4.55 billion US Securities and Exchange Commission settlement. Prosecutors will allow Kwon to be transferred to South Korea after half his US sentence is served. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/general/terraform-labs-founder-do-kwon-pleads-guilty-to-fraud-over-40-billion-crypto-collapse-134009107.html?src=rss",

If you're looking to upgrade from an old pair or want a fresh set for the new school year, you can pick up the AirPods Pro 2 for $169 right now. That's 32 percent off their usual price and one of the best prices we've seen this year.\nApple’s flagship AirPods were $100 off — a record-low $149 — during Prime Day, so we have seen them even cheaper than this, but for a non-sale period, Amazon’s current deal is worth considering.

Not everyone gets on with the sometimes fiddly touch gestures, but a lot of wireless headphones struggle with this. If there’s anything to give you pause, it’s that we might be getting the AirPods Pro 3 sooner rather than later. But if that’s the case, you can be confident you’ll pay a lot more than $169 for the privilege.\nThe AirPods Pro aren’t the only discounted AirPods right now. The AirPods 4 (without ANC) are down to $99. Usually priced at $129, you’re saving $30 on a much improved entry-level AirPods offering. They fit and sound better than any non-Pro AirPods before them, and inherit some previously Pro-only features thanks to the H2 chip.

The response comes after Musk threatened to sue Apple via xAI, claiming the iPhone maker was “behaving in a manner that makes it impossible for any AI company besides OpenAI to reach #1 in the App Store.” Apple and OpenAI entered a partnership last year to integrate the AI company’s models and ChatGPT into Apple products, like Siri and iOS. But there is no evidence that the App Store favors OpenAI over other AI companies — indeed, AI apps like Perplexity and DeepSeek have topped the App Store charts over the last year. In previous years, Apple would have likely ignored claims of chart manipulation. Today, however, the company faces regulatory pressure and new laws around the world to rein in its power in the app distribution market. Apple has also recently been taken to task by a U.S. district judge in its case with Epic Games over not implementing policy changes as the court instructed.

    "summary": "I’m a longtime lover of pen and paper, so E Ink tablets have been intriguing to me ever since they started becoming more widely available. After having hundreds of half-filled notebooks over the years, I, at some point, turned to digital tools instead because it was just easier to store everything on my phone or laptop so I always had my most important information at my fingertips.E-Ink tablets seem to provide the best of both worlds: the tactile satisfaction of regular notebooks with many of the conveniences found in digital tools, plus easy-on-the-eyes E-Ink screens. These devices have come a long way in recent years — now you can find them in multiple sizes, some have color E Ink screens and others double as full-blow ereaders with access to ebook stores and your local library’s offerings. I’ve tested out close to a dozen E Ink tablets over the past few years to see how well they work, how convenient they really are and which are the best tablets using E Ink screens available today.\nTable of contents\n\nBest E Ink tablets for 2025\nAre E Ink tablets worth it?\nWhat to look for in an E Ink tablet\nOther E Ink tablets we've tested\n\nBest E Ink tablets for 2025\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAre E Ink tablets worth it?\nAn E Ink tablet will be a worthwhile purchase to a very select group of people. If you prefer the look and feel of an e paper display to LCD panels found on traditional tablets, it makes a lot of sense. They’re also good options for those who want a more paper-like writing experience (although you can get that kind of functionality on a regular tablet with the right screen protector) or a more distraction-free device overall. \nThe final note is key here. Many E Ink tablets don’t run on the same operating systems as regular tablets, so you’re automatically going to be limited in what you can do. And even with those that do allow you to download traditional apps like Chrome, Instagram and Facebook, E Ink tablets are not designed to give you the best casual-browsing experience. This is mostly due to the nature of E Ink displays, which have noticeable refreshes, a lack of vibrant colors and lower picture quality than the panels you’ll find on even the cheapest iPad.\nArguably the biggest reason why you wouldn’t want to go with an iPad (all models of which support stylus input, a plethora of reading apps, etc) is because it’s much easier to get distracted by email, social media and other Internet-related temptations.\nWhat to look for in an E Ink tablet\nWriting and latency\nArguably the most important thing to consider when looking for an E Ink tablet is the writing experience. How good it is will depend a lot on the display’s refresh rate (does it refresh after every time you put pen to “paper,” or at a different regular interval) and the stylus’ latency. Most of the tablets I’ve tested have little to no latency, but some are certainly better than others. Finally, you should double check before buying that your preferred E Ink tablet comes with a stylus, or if you need to purchase one separately.\nReading\nHow much will you be reading books, documents and other things on this tablet? E Ink tablets come in many sizes, but most of them tend to be larger than your standard e-reader because it makes writing much easier. Having a larger display isn’t a bad thing, but it might make holding it for long periods slightly more uncomfortable. (Most e-readers are roughly the size of a paperback book, giving you a similar feeling to analog reading).\nThe supported file types for e-books can also make a big difference. It’s hard to make a blanket statement here because this varies so much among E Ink tablets. The TL;DR is that you’ll have a much better reading experience if you go with one made by a company that already has a history in e-book sales (i.e. Amazon or Kobo). All of the titles you bought via the Kindle or Kobo store should automatically be available to you on your Kindle or Kobo E Ink tablet.\nAlso with Kindle titles, specifically, since they are protected by DRM, it’s not necessarily the best idea to try to bring those titles over to a third-party device. Unless the tablet runs an operating system like Android that supports downloads for apps like Kindle and Kobo, you’ll be limited to supported file types, like ePUB, PDF, MOBI, JPEG, PNG and others.\nSearch functionality\nMost E Ink tablets have some on-device search features, but they can vary widely between models. You’ll want to consider how important it is to you to be able to search through all your handwritten notes and markups. I noticed in my testing that Amazon’s and Kobo’s E Ink tablets made it easy to refer back to notes made in books and files because they automatically save to the specific pages on which you took notes, made highlights and more.\nSearching is less standardized on E Ink tablets that have different supported file types, but their features can be quite powerful in their own right. For example, a few devices I tested supported text search in handwritten notes along with handwriting recognition, the latter of which allows you to translate your scribbles into typed text.\nSharing and connectivity\nWhile we established that E Ink tablets can be great distraction-free devices, most manufacturers understand that your notes and doodles aren’t created in a vacuum. You may want to access them elsewhere, and that requires some form of connectivity. All of the E Ink tablets I tried have Wi-Fi support, and some support cloud syncing, companion mobile apps and the ability to export notes via email so you can access them elsewhere.\nNone of them, however, integrate directly with a digital note taking system like Evernote or OneNote, so these devices will always be somewhat supplementary if you use apps like that, too. I’d argue that, if you already lean heavily on apps like OneNote, a standard tablet with a stylus and screen protector might be the best way to go. Ultimately, you should think about what you will want to do with the documents you’ll interact with on your E Ink tablet after the tablet portion is done.\nPrice\nE Ink tablets aren’t known for being cheap. They generally fall into the $300-$800 price range, which is what you can expect to pay for a solid regular tablet, too. A key factor in price is size: cheaper devices with E Ink displays are likely to have smaller screens, and stylus support isn’t as much of a given. Also, those types of devices are generally considered e-readers because of their size and may not be the best for note-taking, doodling and the like.\nE Ink tablets have gone up in price recently. Supernote and Onyx Boox increased prices, as did reMarkable. The former said it was due to \"increased costs,” and a reMarkable representative confirmed this to Engadget and provided the following statement: \"We regularly review our pricing based on market conditions and operational costs. We've communicated an upcoming adjustment for the US market effective in May to provide transparency to our customers. Multiple factors influence our pricing decisions, including supply chain dynamics and overall operational costs in specific markets.”\nAs a result, the reMarkable Paper Pro jumped from $579 to $629 (that's for the bundle with the standard Marker and no Folio). This isn't great, considering the Paper Pro was already on the expensive side of the spectrum for E Ink tablets. It's also worth noting that Supernote and Onyx Boox have raised prices in the past few months as well.\nOther E Ink tablets we've tested\nLenovo Smart Paper\nLenovo made a solid E Ink tablet in the Smart Paper, but it's too pricey and too married to the company's companion cloud service to warrant a spot on our top picks list. The hardware is great, but the software isn't as flexible as those of competitors like the reMarkable 2. It has good Google Drive integration, but you must pair it with Lenovo's cloud service to really get the most use out of it — and in the UK, the service costs £9 per month for three months, which is quite expensive.\nOnyx Boox Tab Ultra\nThe Boox Tab Ultra has a lot of the same features we like in the Note Air 2 Plus, but it’s designed to be a true, all-purpose tablet with an E Ink screen. Running Android 11 and compatible with a magnetic keyboard case, you can use it like a standard 2-in-1 laptop, albeit a low-powered one. You can browse the web, check email and even watch YouTube videos on this thing — but that doesn’t mean you should. A standard 2-in-1 laptop with a more responsive screen and better overall performance would be a better fit for most people who even have the slightest desire to have an all-in-one device. Like the rest of Onyx’s devices, the Tab Ultra is specifically for those who put reading and eye comfort above all else.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/best-e-ink-tablet-130037939.html?src=rss",

Rather, it provides the best mix of features people will find useful in an e-paper device like this. Hats off to reMarkable for making an E Ink tablet that feels right at home with all of your other fancy gadgets. I observed basically no lag between my pressing down onto the reMarkable 2’s screen and lines showing up. I noticed a barely perceptible latency and good pressure sensitivity, which is most obvious using the fountain pen. The tap-to-convert feature almost always correctly turned my weird printing-and-cursive-hybrid handwriting into type, and uploading notebooks to Dropbox or Google Drive took mere seconds. Most of the tablets I’ve tested have little to no latency, but some are certainly better than others.

    "summary": "The best soundbars can completely transform your TV setup, turning flat, lifeless audio into something that actually sounds cinematic. Whether you're watching blockbuster movies, listening to music or gaming, a good soundbar delivers clearer vocals, deep bass and better overall playback than most built-in TV speakers ever could.In 2025, there’s a soundbar for every kind of home entertainment setup — from compact all-in-one units to full surround systems with subwoofers and rear speakers. Some prioritize simplicity and sleek design, while others are packed with immersive features like Dolby Atmos and smart voice controls. No matter your budget or your space, we’ve picked the best soundbars you can buy right now to help elevate your audio experience.\nTable of contents\n\nThe post-CES soundbar outlook for 2025\nBest soundbars for 2025\nWhat to look for in a soundbar \nOther soundbars we tested\nBest soundbar FAQs\n\nThe post-CES soundbar outlook for 2025\nI typically come out of CES with a pretty clear understanding of the new soundbars that are coming for the year, but that wasn’t exactly the case in 2025. LG decided to carry over its most premium soundbars from 2024, but it will add the compact S20A this year. The company only previewed the model at CES, so full specs are still forthcoming. \nSamsung will once again keep the same overall design and features for its top-end Q990 soundbar. However, the company is adding a few new tools and it drastically reduced the size of the wireless subwoofer that comes in the box. Samsung does have one new model for 2025, the QS700F, that’s designed to sit on a table or automatically adjust to being mounted flat on a wall. Details are scarce on that soundbar for now and I anticipate a full spec sheet when the company is really to sell it.\nOf the big three TV companies, Sony is the only one that didn’t announce any home theater gear at CES. The company has decided to focus mainly on its automotive efforts at the show recently, leaving TV and audio announcements for later in the year. The company debuted multiple soundbar options in 2024 and a four-speaker setup for the living room in the Bravia Quad. That said, it wouldn’t surprise me if Sony released new soundbars later in the year since its most recent models were only announced last April.\nOne company I would keep an eye on is Sennheiser. The original Ambeo model is nearly six years old and could use a refresh. The company has added medium and mini options to the Ambeo lineup since then, but it would be nice to see a refined version of the largest model too. The original Ambeo soundbar is huge, so no matter how good it sounds, it will always be a tough sell for some people.\nAlthough I think it’s less likely, it’s also possible that Sonos has new soundbars this year. While the company’s next device will likely be the rumored set-top streaming box, the Sound Motion tech inside the Arc Ultra would offer a big improvement to bass performance in compact models like the Beam and Ray. The company may bring Sound Motion to standalone speakers first, but it’s destined for those smaller soundbars eventually.\nThe best soundbars for 2025\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nWhat to look for in a soundbar\nFeatures\nWhen it comes to features, the more you pay the more you're going to get in your new audio system. Most affordable options ($150 or less) will improve your television's audio quality, but that's about it. Step into the $300 to $400 range and you'll find all-in-one soundbars with things like built-in voice control, wireless connectivity, Google Chromecast, AirPlay 2 and even Android TV. They're all helpful when you want to avoid looking for the remote control, but the best playback quality is usually only in the top tier and the formats those premium soundbar systems support. I’m talking about things like Dolby Atmos, DTS:X and other high-resolution audio standards — essentials if you’re building a truly cinematic home entertainment setup. And not all Atmos soundbars are equal, so you'll need to look at the finer details carefully before you break into the savings account. If you're looking for one of the best Dolby Atmos soundbars, size, channels and subwoofer options will be important factors to consider. Some models even include a dedicated subwoofer to enhance bass performance, bringing an extra punch to action scenes and soundtracks.\nPorts\n\n\n\n\nThis is a big one. A lot of the more affordable soundbars are limited when it comes to connectivity options. They either offer an optical port or one HDMI jack and, if you're lucky, both. Things get slightly better in the mid-range section, but that's not always the case. The Sonos Beam, for example, is $449, but only has a single HDMI port. Even at the higher-end, the $899 Sonos Arc still only has one HDMI port. If you plan to connect multiple devices like a set-top box, gaming laptop or console directly to your soundbar for the best audio experience, you’ll want an option with at least two HDMI (eARC) inputs. HDMI connections are critical for supporting Dolby Atmos and Dolby Digital audio formats, as well as high-res passthrough for HDR and 8K/4K content.\nChannels\nAnother big thing you’ll want to pay attention to when looking for the best soundbar is channels. That’s the 2.1, 7.1.2 or other decimal number that companies include in product descriptions. The first figure corresponds to the number of channels. A two would just be left and right while a more robust Atmos system, especially one with rear surround speakers, could be five or seven (left, right, center and upward). The second number refers to the dedicated subwoofer, so if your new soundbar comes with one or has them built in, you’ll see one here. The third numeral is up-firing speakers, important for the immersive effect of Dolby Atmos. Not all Atmos-enabled units have them, but if they do, the third number will tell you how many are in play and how they contribute to the overall soundstage.\nWireless\n\n\n\n\nMost soundbars these days offer either Bluetooth, Wi-Fi or both. When it comes to Wi-Fi, that connectivity affords you luxuries like voice control (either built-in or with a separate device), Chromecast, Spotify Connect and AirPlay 2. Depending on your preferences, you might be able to live without some of these. For me, AirPlay 2 and Chromecast are essentials, but the rest I can live without. Those two give me the ability to beam music and podcasts from my go-to apps without having to settle for — or struggle with — a Bluetooth connection. For instance, Sonos speakers often offer seamless integration with iOS devices, making it easy to connect and stream music wirelessly. If you’re looking for a wireless speaker that can enhance your TV setup while also offering flexibility for audio throughout the house, it's worth considering a multi-room system.\nSize\nThis one might seem obvious but humor me for a minute. Nothing is more soul-crushing than getting a pricey soundbar in your living room only to discover you have to rearrange everything to find a spot for it. This was my plight when the Sennheiser Ambeo Soundbar arrived at my door. Yes, that speaker is absurdly large (and heavy), and most soundbars aren't nearly as big. I learned a valuable lesson: Make sure the space where you want to put a soundbar will accommodate the thing you're about to spend hundreds (if not thousands) of dollars on.\nBasically, it all comes down to the TV you have (or are planning to get) and what the primary goal is for your living-room audio. Is it ease of use? Do you want the best possible sound from a single speaker or speaker/sub combo? Do you just want to be able to actually hear your TV better? Or do you want a full home entertainment experience with crisp vocals, thunderous deep bass, and immersive surround system audio?\nBy paying attention to each of those areas, you should have a good idea of what to look for in a soundbar, soundbar/subwoofer combo, Dolby Digital system or a more robust setup. With that said, we've put numerous products through their paces at Engadget and have a few favorites for best soundbar at various price points to get you started.\nOther soundbars we tested\nSony Bravia Theater Bar 6\nThere’s a lot to like about the Bravia Theater Bar 6, Sony’s new midrange option in its soundbar lineup. Sound quality is the speaker’s best attribute, even though it’s limited by its 3.1.2-channel configuration. The biggest two issues with this model are the lack of Wi-Fi connectivity — which means no AirPlay, Chromecast or Spotify Connect — and the need to use your computer and a thumb drive to install firmware updates. Neither of those should be things you have to consider on a $650 soundbar in 2025.\nSonos Arc\nThere’s no doubt that the Arc is Sonos’ best-sounding soundbar, but it’s also the company’s most expensive. With a new model based on the Arc rumored to be on the way, it’s difficult to recommend this product over the likes of Samsung and Sony. The Arc works well as both a soundbar and a speaker, and the device will fit in nicely with other Sonos gear you might already have for a multiroom setup. It only has one HDMI port though, where much of the competition allows you to connect streaming and gaming devices directly to their soundbars.\nSennheiser Ambeo Soundbar Plus\nI don’t think Sennheiser’s medium-sized model offers enough to stand out from the more powerful Ambeo Soundbar Max or the Ambeo Soundbar Mini. The Mini is more affordable and does a solid job with immersive audio in its own right. Like the rest of the Ambeo lineup, there’s no option for satellite speakers as you can only add a subwoofer to the soundbars. However, the Ambeo Soundbar Plus does have RCA input, so you can use it with a turntable if you’re into vinyl.\nBest soundbar FAQs\nIs a soundbar better than speakers?\nIt really depends on what you’re after. A soundbar is definitely a simpler, more compact solution compared to a full speaker setup. If you want better sound than your TV’s built-in setup but don’t want to deal with multiple speakers and wires everywhere, a soundbar is probably the way to go. Some soundbars can even deliver impressive surround sound effects, thanks to features like Dolby Atmos and virtual audio technology. \nHowever, if you’re an audiophile or want true surround sound for an at-home theater experience, a multi-speaker setup with a receiver, surround speakers and subwoofer will give you a richer soundstage and more control over your experience.\nWhat connection do I need for a soundbar?\nMost modern soundbars connect to your TV via HDMI ARC or eARC, which is the easiest and best option for achieving high-quality audio. If your TV supports this, all you need is an HDMI cable, and you’ll get not only great sound but also some extra features like controlling the soundbar with your TV remote. \nIf HDMI ARC isn’t an option on your TV, you can use an optical cable, which also delivers solid audio quality. Some soundbars even offer Bluetooth or Wi-Fi connections for streaming music, and a few still have a 3.5mm aux jack for connecting to older devices. \nDo all soundbars come with subwoofers?\nNot all soundbars come with subwoofers, but many do or at least offer one as an optional add-on that you can purchase separately. A subwoofer is what gives you that deep, booming bass, so if you like action movies or want a fuller sound for music, having one can make a big difference. Some soundbars have a built-in subwoofer, but these generally don’t provide the same punch as a separate one. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/speakers/best-soundbars-143041791.html?src=rss",

But today, Samsung is changing that with the Odyssey OLED G6, which is the first 500Hz OLED gaming monitor in the world.\nAvailable for $1,000, the Odyssey OLED G6 (G60SF) only comes in one size (27 inches) and features a QHD resolution (2,560 x 1440) with a 16:9 aspect ratio and critically, that blisteringly speedy 500Hz refresh rate with a .03ms (GTG) response time. Its QD-OLED panel also has a matte anti-reflective coating and support for both AMD FreeSync Premium Pro and NVIDIA G-Sync. And after seeing it in person, it really is a very pretty monitor, as it boasts vibrant colors and deep inky blacks while still being able to satisfy even the most demanding competitive gamers.\nSam Rutherford for Engadget\nThat said, the Odyssey OLED G6 is a rather straightforward product. It doesn't come with any of Samsung's built-in smart features like an included remote or the company's Gaming Hub. And with a typical brightness of just 300 nits, while you do get VESA DisplayHDR TrueBlack 500 certification, it's not the best monitor to put in a sunny room.\nBut that's not exactly a deal-breaker, because from what I've seen, this thing is a purpose-built device that's meant to do one thing really well: display games super fast without sacrificing on image quality. And if for some reason you get tired of playing games, you could do some photo or video editing as the display is Pantone Validated and covers 99 percent of the DCI-P3 spectrum.\nAside from the Odyssey OLED G6, today Samsung is also introducing a couple new additions to the Odyssey G7 line as well. The smaller of the two is the 37-inch Odyssey G7 which features more traditional dimensions including a 4K curved 16:9 VA panel with a typical brightness of 350 nits and a 165Hz refresh rate.\nSam Rutherford for Engadget\nAlternatively, for those who prefer ultra-wide monitors, the 40-inch Odyssey G7 has the same brightness and 1000R curve as its smaller sibling, but with a 21:9 WUHD (5,120 x 2160) resolution and a slightly faster 180Hz refresh rate. Interestingly, despite being the wider of the two, due to its 16:9 aspect ratio, the 37-inch Odyssey G7 looks larger in person. And thanks to their slightly higher brightness, both the 37 and 40-inch Odyssey G7 have VESA Display HDR 600 ratings.\nAll three monitors are on sale today.

    "summary": "Alien: Earth delivers everything you'd want from a series with \"Alien\" in the title: The iconic Xenomorphs hunting down hapless humans; gratuitous body horror; and androids who you can never fully trust. But writer/director Noah Hawley (Legion, Fargo) and his team also manage to push the franchise to new heights, delving into the philosophical questions that Ridley Scott's Prometheus and Alien Covenant couldn't fully explore. It's not just merely an Alien TV show — it's a meticulously crafted experience that elevates the entire franchise, even more so than the recent Alien: Romulus.\nThe series, which premieres today on FX and Hulu, takes place two years before the original Alien. It starts with the familiar: A group of astronauts awakening from cryosleep on a retro-futuristic-Weyland Yutani shipping vessel. We learn they're carrying precious extraterrestrial cargo, which predictably breaks loose and wreaks havoc throughout the ship. Meanwhile on Earth (somewhere we haven't seen at all in the franchise), we're introduced to a terminally ill child undergoing a radical new procedure: having her brain uploaded into a Synthetic body (played by Sydney Chandler).\n\nThis child takes the name Wendy — one of many Peter Pan references in the series — and embraces her new (and more mature) robotic body with childlike wonder. Instead of just being a frail kid, she becomes incredibly strong, with fast reflexes and the ability to jump down safely from great heights. It's like she's become an anime heroine a la Battle Angel Alita (at one point, she straps on a katana-like sword simply because it looks badass).\nWendy isn't human, but she's not a total android either since her personality and memories are uploaded from a human brain. She's something entirely new. She becomes a sort of older sibling to other sick kids going through the same human-Synthetic hybridization process, and together they form their own spin on the Lost Boys (including some girls). They even go so far as to take names from Peter Pan characters (one kid, unfortunately, gets stuck with the name Smee, after Captain Hook's cowardly lackey). And to her creator, Prodigy Corporation head Boy Kavalier (Samuel Blenkin), she's the key to a future where people can cheat death and practically live forever in synthetic bodies.\nFX\nThe alien-filled spaceship ends up crash-landing in one of Prodigy's cities in Southeast Asia (in this universe, five mega-corporations run the world, nation states no longer exist), and Boy Kavalier recklessly decides to test his new hybrid superteam with a rescue mission. They discover one survivor, Morrow (Babou Ceesay), a loyal security officer with a badass robotic arm, as well as a classic Xenomorph and a slew of new species. I won't spoil much about them here, but I have a feeling the cheeky multi-eyeball parasite will quickly become a fan-favorite.\nAlien: Earth finally immerses us in elements of the franchise the movies could only hint at. We see what a completely corporate-run Earth looks like, and it's as gross as you'd imagine. As usual, Weyland-Yutani prioritizes its extraterrestrial treasures over the lives of its workers. But it's even more sickening to see Boy Kavalier — the sort of obnoxious tech bro who defiantly puts his bare feet on desks during meetings — salivate at the opportunity to steal and study the alien cargo. Never mind the hundreds (and potentially thousands) of lives lost in his own city, or the inherent dangers in bringing deadly alien creatures into his research lab.\nTimothy Olyphant as Kirsh.Patrick Brown/FX\nThe series is at its best when it interrogates the big questions posed (with more or less deftness) by the films about the nature of being human. And where does that leave the new hybrids, who combine human memory and emotion with Synthetic bodies, who are somewhat immortal? In many ways, Alien :Earth seems just as cynical about humanity's value to the world as Scott's films. Humans will sacrifice countless lives for greed — maybe the planet would actually be better off without us.\nWith Prometheus, Ridley Scott aimed to explore the hubris of humans attempting to meet their creator, and the possibility the Synthetics (like Michael Fassbender’s David) may be more of evolved lifeforms. But the broader themes were bogged down by weak scripts (and from what I’ve heard, Scott’s own interference in the story). Alien: Covenant was even less memorable. Both films suffered from the demands of being big-budget blockbusters – they couldn’t slow down long enough to let the audience think, instead they had to rush to the next set piece. An eight-episode TV series made for a streaming network doesn’t have to play by the same rules.\nBabou Ceesay as Morrow in Alien: Earth.Patrick Brown/FX\nEven if you don’t want to engage with bigger ideas, though, Alien: Earth remains an embarrassment of riches. It features entirely new ways for extraterrestrials, not just Xenomorphs, to dismember their victims. It’s filled with fantastic performances across the board — Sydney Chandler, who has more of Wendy’s spunky energy than her Peter Pan namesake, is a standout. Babou Ceesay’s Morrow is ostensibly an antagonist, but it’s heartbreaking to see what he gives up to become a dutiful corporate underling. (His robotic arm can also whip out a sick Wolverine-like blade. How can you not love that?!)\nFans of the great Timothy Olyphant (Justified, Deadwood) will certainly appreciate his performance as Kirsh, Boy Kavalier’s Synthetic security head. We don’t get the playful side of Olyphant that we saw in Justified, but it’s endlessly entertaining to see his contempt for all humans (including his own boss) simmering beneath the surface.\nI’ll admit, I was skeptical that Noah Hawley could deliver a decent Alien TV series. Legion was all style and no substance in my opinion, and while I enjoyed the first few seasons of Fargo, the end of its run was uneven. But with Alien: Earth, he has made something special. It’s not the thematic upgrade that Andor was for Star Wars, but it’s a sign that there’s still plenty of life left in the aging Alien franchise.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/tv-movies/alien-earth-succeeds-where-ridley-scotts-alien-sequels-failed-173234905.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Riot is making a major change to League of Legends after 16 years. It's adding the option to move around by using WASD controls instead of relying on a mouse to point and click, according to a video detailing the upcoming change.\nPaul Bellezza, an executive producer on the game, says this is an attempt to attract new players. \"We found that a lot of new or returning players struggle a lot with League's controls early on,\" he said. \"Click to move just isn't the sort of control scheme they're used to, and it puts a lot of people off including many that we believe would otherwise really love the game.\"\n\nThe company says it's \"working hard to ensure that both control schemes feel great across all ranks, champions and modes.\" One of the producers behind the new feature says it won't be \"changing what makes League, League,\" which should assuage the worries of long-time players. The company is also not shy about reversing course if something doesn't work.\nRiot has been testing the control scheme for some time to fine-tune the option. It'll be arriving as a public beta in the near future, sometime in \"the next few patches.\" The devs say the feature will stay in beta so the team can \"catch any bugs, unintended interactions and to ensure that your ranked games aren't disrupted by someone WASDing into walls.\"\nIt's smart for the team to take the slow approach here to make sure that both control schemes are fairly balanced. This also makes me wonder if the introduction of WASD controls signals a forthcoming release on home consoles.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/riot-is-trying-to-make-lol-more-accessible-by-adding-wasd-controls-170549596.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Anthropic has announced it will offer its Claude AI model to all three branches of the US government for $1, following OpenAI offering an almost identical deal last week. These deals both follow the General Services Administration adding OpenAI, Gemini and Anthropic to a list of approved AI vendors for the federal government.\nSimilar to the OpenAI deal, Anthropic will offer access to its commercial-tier service Claude for Enterprise for a period of one year at a cost of just $1. The offer will also encompass Claude for Government, which supports FedRAMP High workloads, allowing federal workers to use Claude for sensitive unclassified work. Government department or agency leadership can reach out today to gain access.\nAnthropic is no stranger to working within the federal government. Earlier this summer, the Department of Defense awarded Anthropic, Google, OpenAI and XAI with deals worth up to $200 million to develop military applications.\nThe company made no larger mention of the Trump administration's AI Action Plan, or its requirement that large language models used by the federal government be \"free from top-down ideological bias.\" The tacit understanding is that these LLMs not espouse support for anything the current administration opposes. President Trump even issued an executive order decreeing that AI must not favor \"ideological dogmas such as DEI,\" in order to work with the federal government.\nThis latest deal comes as AI-related companies are increasingly looking to build close relationships with policymakers and the current administration. This week, NVIDIA agreed to a revenue-sharing agreement with the US government in order to sell its H20 AI GPUs to China. The current administration has made no secret of its wish for federal agencies to maximize their use of AI.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/anthropic-offers-its-claude-ai-model-to-the-federal-government-for-1-154217798.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Apple's AirPods could be getting a live translation feature in the near future as part of iOS 26, according to a report by 9to5Mac. A new beta version of the operating system dropped today and users have spotted a system asset that strongly points to the earbuds getting a language translation tool.\nThe asset appears to depict a gesture that's triggered by pressing both earbud stems at once. The image shows a pair of AirPods surrounded by words in various languages, like English, French, German and Portuguese.\nLive Translation Coming to AirPods https://t.co/YUKtEsOYNn pic.twitter.com/wEPYDVlmJJ— MacRumors.com (@MacRumors) August 11, 2025\n\nThis tracks for a couple of reasons. Apple announced a Live Translation tool at WWDC25, but AirPods weren't mentioned as a potential use case scenario. This feels like a natural extension for the feature that we already know is coming to FaceTime, Messages and phone calls. However, the AirPods software will be used for live in-person conversations. \nAlso, this isn't the first time we've heard rumblings that the software would be coming to Apple's line of earbuds. Bloomberg announced it was likely coming back in March, which was well before WWDC. Wearables are the perfect place for any kind of live translation software and we've already seen it pop up in stuff like the Meta Ray-Bans smart glasses.\nThere are still some unknowns. We don't know if the feature will run entirely on the actual earbuds or if it'll require an iPhone. The latter is likely, given that it seems tied to iOS 26. We also don't know which iPhones will support the software, though it'll likely be on models that offer Apple Intelligence. Apple iOS 26 is due next month, so we don't have that long to wait.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/apples-rumored-live-translation-feature-for-airpods-could-be-coming-with-ios-26-152715034.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Are you a TV watcher with commitment issues? Sling TV thinks it has the answer in the shape of its new one-day passes. The app-based alternative to traditional cable will sell you a $5 Day Pass that allows you to stream live TV (including sports)from any channel included in its Sling Orange plan for 24 hours.\nSling Orange costs $46 per month and includes the likes of the Disney Channel and various ESPN channels (including ESPN 4K) as plan exclusives. You also get access to channels like TBS, TNT, CNN, AMC and Comedy Central that are shared across both Sling Orange and the more expensive Sling Blue plan. On paper, Orange seems like a good choice for sports fans, given ESPN’s exclusive presence, but bear in mind that Fox Sports is a Blue plan-only channel.\nSling TV’s new Day Pass offering arrives just ahead of the new football season, and allows people who really want to watch a particular game without committing long term to do so. The streaming service is also introducing Weekend ($10) and Week ($15) passes for when you’re hoping to catch multiple traditional Pay-Per-View events or binge a series on a single pass. You can access more channels by adding one of Sling’s category-specific packages, like Sports Extra, News Extra or Entertainment Extra. Sling Extras cost $1 per package for a Day Pass, $2 for a Weekend Pass and $3 for a Week Pass.\nHow much value you get from Sling’s offering will depend on your viewing habits. If you find yourself buying lots of passes each month it’s probably worth considering a standard Sling Blue or Orange plan, but if you’re only interested in catching the occasional game, Sling TV’s flexibility could be appealing.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/sling-tv-launches-a-5-day-pass-for-commitment-free-cable-150021645.html?src=rss",
