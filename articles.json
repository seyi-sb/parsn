After that, whenever you want to send someone a notification, just open your conversation with then, tap on the Map icon and then tap the \"Home Safe\" button. \nThe app has had location sharing for a while now, but it has built up the safety feature over the years.

    "full_text": "Snapchat is launching a new way for users to let their friends and family know they’ve made it home safe after an outing, called “Home Safe,” the social network announced on Thursday. To use the feature, you need to set your home location by tapping your Bitmoji on Snap Map and then “My Home.” When you head out and want to notify a friend when you get home, open the conversation, tap the Map icon, and then the Home Safe button. Your friend will receive an automatic alert in your chat conversation once you arrive home. Snapchat notes that alerts can only be sent to friends you already share your location with. Plus, since location sharing on Snap Map is off by default, no one can see your location or receive a Home Safe alert unless you choose to share it. “Whether you’re heading back from a first date, a crowded concert, or a weekend getaway, Home Safe can offer a close friend or family member peace of mind that you’ve made it home safely,” Snapchat wrote in a blog post. This new feature comes two months after Snapchat announced that Snap Map now has more than 400 million monthly active users. Snap Map, which launched in 2017, was originally a way for users to see their friends’ locations and browse public snaps from around the world. Over time, the feature has evolved and now offers ways for users to discover local hotspots and find things to do."

The Kindle Colorsoft Signature Edition will still be available for $279.99. “Our customers have loved reading Kindle in color — on average, they spend more time on Kindle Colorsoft and read hundreds more pages than on our other Kindle devices,” the company says in a blog post. “That’s why we’re excited to introduce two new additions to the Kindle Colorsoft family.” The cheaper Colorsoft costs $30 less than the Signature Edition, but the more costly model has a few extra perks, including 32GB of storage, an auto-adjusting front light, and wireless charging. The kids-focused bundle, which Amazon is calling Kindle Colorsoft Kids, comes with a Colorsoft (the 16GB model, according to spokesperson Connor Rice), a special cover (you can pick one of two options), and one year of its Amazon Kids Plus subscription. Shortly after its release, Amazon briefly paused shipments of the Signature Edition following customer complaints about a yellow bar on the screen. Amazon now has a message on the Signature Edition’s store listing acknowledging that “a small number of customers have reported a yellow band,” and an Amazon spokesperson told The Verge that the company made “a combination of software and display adjustments” to address the issue."

Building on the app’s existing location capabilities, Snapchat’s Home Safe allows you to send an automatic alert to chat conversations with friends to let them know you’re back at home without having to remember to send direct messages.

Snap says that the notification only goes out once and then shuts off automatically. The alerts can only be sent to friends that Snapchat users are already sharing their location with, which allows users to proactively select exactly who they want to send the Home Safe alerts to. The Home Safe notifications will appear like this in the conversations they’re activated in. Image: Snapchat To access the feature, users need to set their home location on Snap Map by tapping on their Bitmoji and then selecting “My Home.” Once the location is set, users can then tap on the Map icon in their conversations and select the “Home Safe” button when starting to make the journey back home.

An upcoming feature for AI Mode will generate images of outfits and decor ideas based on user descriptions, to help people find visually similar products. Also launching is a new tool that allows people to virtually try on clothes.

If users search for “a green flowy dress for a garden party,” for example, AI Mode will generate images of fake dresses in a variety of different styles that allow users to find the closest match to the dress they were envisioning. Google will then show the users real listings for visually similar dresses in online stores. Here’s an example of the upcoming AI Mode feature in action. The initial images that Google AI Mode will generate are still fake, however, which may cause some disappointment for users who can’t find an exact match for the AI clothing and decor suggestions they’ve fallen in love with. For something that’s actually available today, Google is rolling out a virtual try-on tool in the US that allows shoppers to see what clothes look like on themselves by uploading a photo. Google’s AI will then show the user what they might look like wearing the apparel they’ve selected, giving users a more personalized experience than seeing those clothes modeled on someone else."

    "summary": "Update (7/24/25): Only a couple of days after the new Switch 2 Pokémon Legends: Z-A bundle was announced, you can now pre-order it at various retailers or pick up an existing Switch 2 bundle that's back in stock. The Pokémon bundle, which will be widely available in October, is available for pre-order from Walmart, Target and Best Buy. The Switch 2 Mario Kart World bundle is back in stock at Walmart and Best Buy at the moment as well.\n\nThe Nintendo Switch 2 is finally available in the US, but it's still pretty tough to find it in stock online anywhere. The $450 console officially went up for sale on June 5, and several retailers have offered it both online and in-store in the week since. While millions of people have been able to buy theirs so far, online inventory has dried up considerably since launch day. There have been restocks at Walmart, Target and Best Buy, but they didn't last long, which was to be expected. You may also be able to grab a bundle at Costco if you’re a member there, but you might have a better time doing so in store than online. \nAnd that may be the way to go at this point, broadly speaking. You may have better luck venturing into a physical store and walking out with a Switch 2 than you will buying one online. If you have a local Target, Best Buy, Walmart or GameStop — the four official retailers Nintendo lists on its store page — it can't hurt to stop by and see if they have any in stock. A few retailers, GameStop being one of them, are even directing online customers to \"find a store\" near them that has the console in stock. If you're still on the hunt, we’ve rounded up all of the latest information we could find on how to buy the Nintendo Switch 2 and where you can pick one up.\nWhere to buy the Nintendo Switch 2\nWalmart has restocked the Switch 2 a few times since launch, but most of the time, the new stock has been exclusively available to Walmart+ members, or they've gotten first pick before the wider public. Walmart works with third-party sellers across its site, and outside of official restocks, we've seen the Switch 2 become available at much higher prices than normal. We do not recommend buying the Switch 2 at a premium like this, but rather it's better to wait for an official restock. Naturally, the world's largest retailer is also selling the console at its brick-and-mortar locations, though the company has noted that quantities are limited and inventory will vary by location.\nAmazon finally has the Switch 2 listed now: the Switch 2 console is up for $450 while the Mario Kart World bundle costs $500. This comes after weeks of the console being conspicuously absent from the retail giant's site. A June 30 Bloomberg report confirmed what had been widely rumored for weeks: Nintendo was apparently punishing Amazon for continuing to surface third-party retailers selling trans-shipped games. That punishment appears to be over now, but note that both the console by itself and the bundle are available \"by invitation\" only from Amazon, which just means you have to register your interest with Amazon before you get an official invite that will allow you to buy the Switch 2.\nBest Buy has restocked a few times since launch as well, and similarly to Walmart, we recommend waiting for official restocks to buy in the future. Best Buy stores may also have limited quantities available to buy in person.\nTarget is much the same deal as Walmart and Best Buy, although it has been less forthcoming about announcing future restocks than the other two retailers. You may have some luck going to a local Target store near you and checking to see if they have consoles to buy in store.\nGameStop has advertised in-store availability, though exactly how much stock your local store may have will vary by location. Online, the device has been unavailable for the past week, with the listings for the base console and Mario Kart bundle now pointing to a \"Find a Store\" page. \nYou may still have some luck at certain membership-based retailers. A Mario Kart World bundle at Costco that includes a 12-month Switch Online subscription has gone in and out of stock since launch day. Sam's Club has had a bundle without the Switch Online sub as well, though it's out of stock now. We also saw the console at BJ's early on June 5, but it's showing up as out of stock now.\nVerizon briefly had the Switch 2 available on launch day, but that's dried up. Only those with Verizon service were able to order, and the process was apparently somewhat rocky. \nNewegg has listed the Switch 2 on its site for several weeks, but it's given no indication as to when it'll begin sales. While some listings are available via a third-party seller, they're at massively inflated prices.\nWith all of these stores, we've seen the Mario Kart World bundle available in greater quantities online than the base console, which costs $50 less. But given that Mario Kart is the Switch 2's biggest launch game and retails for $80 on its own, that may not be the worst thing.\nNintendo, meanwhile, is only offering the Switch 2 via an invite system. This requires you to have been a Switch Online member for at least 12 months and logged at least 50 hours of Switch 1 playtime as of April 2. It can't hurt to sign up if you meet the criteria, but don't expect it to bear fruit immediately — it's taken weeks for many people who registered in April to receive their invite.\nYou can find a list of every Switch 2 retail listing we could find below. Just be aware that this is meant to be a reference, not a rundown of everywhere the device is available right this second.\nWhere to buy Switch 2 + Mario Kart World bundle:\n\nWalmart\nGameStop\nBest Buy\nTarget\nCostco (membership required)\nSam's Club (membership required)\nVerizon (service required)\n\nWhere to buy Switch 2 + Pokémon Legends: Z-A bundle (pre-order now, available October 16):\n\nWalmart\nBest Buy\nTarget\n\nWhere to buy Switch 2:\n\nWalmart\nGameStop\nBest Buy\nTarget\nBJ's (membership required)\nVerizon (service required)\n\nWhere to buy Nintendo Switch 2 games and accessories\nNintendo is selling a number of Switch 2 accessories alongside the console, from its (pricey) Pro Controller to cases to cameras for the new GameChat feature. Most of these became available on June 5. The same goes for games like Mario Kart World and the Switch 2 version of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. Another big Switch 2 release, Donkey Kong Bananza, will be available shortly starting on July 17 but is still up for pre-order now.\nAs of this publication, just about all Switch 2 games are broadly available. Stock for the accessories remains a little spottier, but most devices are still available at multiple retailers. Nintendo's official Switch 2 carrying cases have been the main exceptions, so you may need to look to third-party alternatives if you want some protection for your console right away.\nMario Kart World ($80)\n\nNintendo\nWalmart\nGameStop\nBest Buy\nTarget\n\nDonkey Kong Bananza ($70)\n\nNintendo\nAmazon\nWalmart\nGameStop\nBest Buy\nTarget\nCostco (membership required)\n\nAdditional Switch 2 games\n\nNintendo\nAmazon\nWalmart\nGameStop\nBest Buy\nTarget\n\nSamsung microSD Express Card (256GB) for Nintendo Switch 2 ($60)\n\nNintendo\nWalmart\nGameStop\nBest Buy\nTarget\nAmazon\n\nJoy-Con 2 bundle ($95)\n\nNintendo\nWalmart\nGameStop\nBest Buy\nTarget\n\nSwitch 2 Pro Controller ($85)\n\nNintendo (invite required)\nWalmart\nGameStop\nBest Buy\nTarget\nCostco ($75, membership required)\n\nSwitch 2 Camera ($55)\n\nNintendo\nWalmart\nGameStop\nBest Buy\nTarget\n\nHori Nintendo Switch 2 Piranha Plant Camera ($60)\n\nBest Buy\nTarget\nAmazon\n\nJoy-Con 2 Charging Grip ($40)\n\nNintendo\nWalmart\nGameStop\nBest Buy\nTarget\n\nJoy-Con 2 Wheels (set of 2) ($25)\n\nNintendo\nWalmart\nGameStop\nBest Buy\nTarget\n\nSwitch 2 All-in-One Carrying Case ($85)\n\nNintendo\nWalmart\nGameStop\nBest Buy\nTarget\n\nSwitch 2 Carrying Case and Screen Protector ($40)\n\nNintendo (invite required)\nWalmart\nGameStop\nBest Buy\nTarget\n\nNintendo Switch 2 Dock Set ($120)\n\nNintendo\n\nNintendo GameCube Controller for Switch 2 ($65)\n\nNintendo (Switch Online required)\n\n This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/how-to-buy-the-switch-2-nintendos-restock-updates-at-walmart-best-buy-target-and-others-120039239.html?src=rss",
    "full_text": "Update (7/24/25): Only a couple of days after the new Switch 2 Pokémon Legends: Z-A bundle was announced, you can now pre-order it at various retailers or pick up an existing Switch 2 bundle that's back in stock. While millions of people have been able to buy theirs so far, online inventory has dried up considerably since launch day. And that may be the way to go at this point, broadly speaking. If you have a local Target, Best Buy, Walmart or GameStop — the four official retailers Nintendo lists on its store page — it can't hurt to stop by and see if they have any in stock. We do not recommend buying the Switch 2 at a premium like this, but rather it's better to wait for an official restock. GameStop has advertised in-store availability, though exactly how much stock your local store may have will vary by location. Verizon briefly had the Switch 2 available on launch day, but that's dried up. Only those with Verizon service were able to order, and the process was apparently somewhat rocky.

The 2015 film from writer-director George Miller is set in a post-apocalyptic desert and is essentially a non-stop battle sequence where hero Max Rockatansky (Tom Hardy) teams up with Theron's Imperator Furiosa to wage battle against warlord Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne) and his army. After reconnecting, the two friends explore their friendship and wonder what might have been had Nora never left. Grug doesn't always welcome learning new things from a human and Eep's curious, sometimes rebellious ways also contribute to family disagreements. 20th Century Pictures Heat (1995) Michael Mann's 1995 movie Heat is most famous for being the first film in which acting titans Al Pacino and Robert De Niro appeared on screen in a scene together but it also features a fantastic performance from the late, great Val Kilmer. Taylour Paige, Colman Domingo and Glynn Turman all co-star in the film that was adapted from August Wilson's 1982 play. Rustin's outspoken activism and homosexuality made him a target -- not just for political adversaries but sometimes even among his allies. Rating: PG-13 Godzilla Minus One is an Academy Award-winning Japanese-language movie written and directed by Takashi Yamazaki. After surviving an encounter with Godzilla, he and others realize the kaiju is gearing up to attack Tokyo. (It feels impossible to imagine so many mega-stars assembling in one room for something like this today.)"

    "full_text": "Apple announced some big changes to its device protection plans this week with the introduction of AppleCare One. The new service lets you protect three devices for $19.99 per month. And every device after that costs $5.99 per month to add. The company’s goal is to convince customers that this new service is easier and a better value compared to enrolling each device in its own AppleCare Plus plan. But that’s not true across the board for all of its models. Paying for a monthly AppleCare Plus plan for each of those three would cost $47.47 altogether, according to a list of prices Apple PR manager Anna Mitchell shared with The Verge. What’s important to keep in mind is, just like AppleCare Plus, AppleCare One only serves as the key to unlock cheaper repair and replacement prices. Either warranty plan you opt for yields significant savings versus paying out of pocket without coverage. One of its biggest selling points is that you can enroll devices up to four years old that are in good condition (or up to one year old for headphones). In other words, if you missed the boat on enrolling your devices originally and want to reduce the upfront cost of repairs for eligible devices, AppleCare One seems like a great way to do that."

In a video conference call after Netflix's earnings were announced on July 17, Sarandos took questions, one of which was focused on when and how the streaming company will generate content with artificial intelligence tools. For a scene showing a building collapsing in Buenos Aires, Netflix's tech team worked with the filmmakers to generate AI footage that was used as final footage. \"We remain convinced that AI represents an incredible opportunity to help creators make films and series better, not just cheaper,\" Sarandos said in the call. \"They were able to achieve an amazing result with remarkable speed,\" Sarandos said. El Eternauta has already been renewed for a second season and received positive reviews. \"Netflix using AI for final footage in El Eternauta isn't entirely surprising given their track record of embracing new technologies early -- from streaming to algorithm-driven recommendations to interactive content,\" Kate O'Neill, founder of KO Insights and author of What Matters Next, told CNET. \"What's notable is how matter-of-factly CEO Ted Sarandos revealed this, suggesting they view it as a natural evolution rather than a watershed moment,\" O'Neill says. Some of those ethical and legal questions include what data AI models are being trained on and if intellectual property is being infringed upon, not to mention the effect widespread AI may have on an industry of actors, craftspeople and digital-effects workers. \"While AI can democratize access to sophisticated visual effects, we need transparency about how these tools are trained and whether they're incorporating existing copyrighted material,\" O'Neill says."

On the back, there are two programmable buttons that you can remap to almost any keypress. If you're switching Bluetooth inputs, just be prepared that it might take a couple of minutes before everything's ready to go. You'll quickly get spoiled by not having to manually turn on your console like a Neanderthal. Aside from the magnetic faceplates, there are plenty of other customization options available in GameSir Connect app for Windows. There are also iOS and Android apps, but they don't offer quite as much customization. I do wish you could store multiple profiles on the controller, and some people might be turned off by the lack of Xbox support, but none of those are deal-breakers for me. If you want to upgrade your Switch controller with one that also works great for PC and mobile, or if you want a great, inexpensive extra controller for your partner or kiddos, you really can't go wrong with the Super Nova."

You can customize the backlight for every key and there are several different lighting effects to choose from. The MX 8.2 is built for gamers and as such, has a few gaming-focused features that are helpful. It also supports full n-key rollover, which means every keypress is registered even when pressing multiple keys at once. That being said, Cherry offers superb craftsmanship and a wonderful typing experience with the MX 8.2. The compact layout means it doesn't take up a lot of room on your desk while the per-key RGB lighting offers a lot of customization, as long as you're prepared for an annoying software experience. If you need a dedicated gaming keyboard that goes all-in on features and performance, there are better options."

The iPhone 16E shipped with Apple's C1 cellular modem, Apple's first homebrew cellular hardware it has been trying to build in order to wean its dependence on Qualcomm, which has provided the modem hardware in previous iPhone models.

Prostaglandins are hormone-like substances that impact bodily functions like inflammation, pain and menstrual cramps. \"Although clinical evidence of the acute dietary magnesium deficiency as a direct migraine trigger remains limited, scientists are investigating the involvement of intra- and extracellular magnesium levels in migraine pathogenesis,\" Daidone explains. Dr. Schonze Del Pozo, a board-certified internal medicine physician and medical director at East Sacramento Concierge, states that many of the patients she sees for headaches and migraines are deficient in magnesium. She also cites a 2012 study in the Journal of Neural Transmission entitled \"Why all migraine patients should be treated with magnesium.\" \"Cinnamon contains a high amount of antioxidants that may also reduce headache frequency,\" Campbell explains. Though this high dose usually comes from supplementation, riboflavin-rich foods support the same metabolic processes in migraine prevention. Over a 5-year period, doctors at a neurology clinic in Israel treated 36 children and adolescents (average age 9) with severe daily or near-daily headaches who drank an average of 11 quarts of cola drinks per week,\" says Redwood. Nearly all cola drinks contain substantial amounts of caffeine (Chou and Bell, 2007).\" Note: 11 quarts of cola per week is extreme, and the average person doesn't consume this much caffeine."

    "summary": "If you're lucky enough to have a new Nintendo Switch 2 in hand right now, you're probably filling it up with old and new games alike. The console comes with 256GB of storage built in; that's eight times more than the original Switch and four times more than the Switch OLED. But the new console’s improved performance means that some games will hog a ton of that space. Take, for instance, Cyberpunk 2077, which is a 59GB download, while Split Fiction checks in at 69GB. While not all titles hog so much storage, there's a good chance you'll want to add more space to your Switch 2 as time goes on.\nYou'll need a microSD Express card to do that. These are not the same as the standard microSD cards you may have for the first Switch or other gaming handhelds. They're newer, faster and (as to be expected) more expensive. But if you want more space, they’re your only choice. If you’re looking to grab one today, we’ve laid out the best microSD cards for the Switch 2 and broken down what you should know before you buy.\nThe best microSD cards for the Switch 2 (and why you might want to wait to buy)\nThe SanDisk microSD Express Card and Lexar Play Pro.Jeff Dunn for Engadget\nThe Switch 2 is the first mainstream device to require microSD Express for storage expansion, so there aren’t many options available to buy just yet. To make things easy, here’s a list of every microSD Express card we’ve seen at retailers at the time of writing.\n128GB\n\nSanDisk microSD Express Card ($54 MSRP)\nPNY microSD Express Card ($45 MSRP)\n\n256GB\n\nSamsung microSD Express Card for Nintendo Switch 2 ($60 MSRP)\nSanDisk microSD Express Card ($73 MSRP)\nLexar Play Pro ($50 MSRP)\nPNY microSD Express Card ($59 MSRP)\nGameStop Express microSD Card for Nintendo Switch 2 ($60 MSRP)\nOnn microSD Express Card ($36 MSRP)\n\n512GB\n\nLexar Play Pro ($100 MSRP)\nGameStop Express microSD Card for Nintendo Switch 2 ($100 MSRP)\nOnn microSD Express Card ($66 MSRP)\n\n1TB\n\nLexar Play Pro ($200 MSRP)\nGameStop Express microSD Card for Nintendo Switch 2 ($190 MSRP)\n\nNintendo says the Switch 2 technically supports cards with a capacity up to 2TB, but we haven’t seen any microSD Express model go beyond 1TB just yet. It’s also worth noting that GameStop and Onn (Walmart’s in-house electronics brand) aren’t manufacturers, so it’s unclear who exactly is making their cards.\nStock for these cards remains somewhat patchy, particularly for the higher-capacity options. But many of the 128GB and 256GB models appear to be steadily available as of the Switch 2's launch week. Just be warned that you may have to deal with extended ship times in some cases. SanDisk’s microSD Express Card has also increased in price since it first went up for sale in February; originally, it cost $45 for 128GB and $60 for 256GB. \nEither way, all of these cards are far pricier than traditional microSD options. The Samsung Pro Plus, for example, costs $17 for 128GB, $25 for 256GB, $43 for 512GB and $90 for 1TB as of this writing.\nRemember: You’re looking for microSD Express, not “Extreme,” like the branding SanDisk uses for some of its conventional microSD cards. A microSD Express card will have a big “EX” logo printed on it — if you see that, you should be good to go.\nAll microSD Express cards will have this \"EX\" logo printed on them.Nintendo/Engadget\nWe’ve already tested SanDisk’s Express card and the Lexar Play Pro for our broader guide to the best microSD cards. Between the two, SanDisk’s card has much faster sequential read speeds — up to 899 MB/s vs. 712 MB/s in CrystalDiskMark, to name one benchmark — which theoretically makes it better equipped to reduce load times.\nThe Play Pro is quicker for sequential writes (up to 720 MB/s vs. 650 MB/s), available in more sizes and should be cheaper at 256GB whenever it’s in stock. (SanDisk says the 128GB version of its card has slower sequential writes than the 256GB model, too.) Random performance is about equal, so the two should be similarly adept at keeping large games like Mario Kart World running smoothly.\nWe mainly tested those cards on a Windows PC and Mac, though. How they perform on the actual Switch 2 remains to be seen. Nintendo didn’t send out early review units to press, and we've only just received our own retail model. So we’ll need a few more days to finish testing.\nFor now, though, we can’t say for sure if the console renders all microSD Express cards to similar speeds. That was largely the case with the first Switch: Once a (regular) microSD card hit a certain threshold of performance, there wasn’t that much practical difference between it and other alternatives. The Switch 2 is working with a different standard, but if something similar were to happen again, the “best” microSD Express card would simply be the most affordable one from a reputable brand in the capacity you want.\nThat brings us to our main piece of advice: If you can hold off on buying one of these things early on, that’s probably a good idea. It’s not just about the lack of testing — truthfully, we’d be surprised if any of these cards are truly “bad.”\nIt's more about value: Barring more tariff shenanigans, all of these cards are as expensive today as they’re ever likely to get. The Switch 2 is already popular and will continue to be, thus more microSD Express cards will need to be made and prices will (eventually) come down. Try to use all 256 of the gigabytes baked into the Switch 2 first, even if it means having to delete a game or two. But if you’re absolutely sure you want more space right away, the cards above should be good enough.\nWhat are microSD Express cards?\nA microSD Express card like the one on the right has a second row of pins on the back.Jeff Dunn for Engadget\nMost microSD cards are based on a standard called Ultra High Speed (UHS), of which there are three versions: UHS-I, UHS-II and UHS-III. The vast majority of cards you may have bought in the past utilize UHS-I. These have one row of pins in the back and a theoretical maximum data transfer speed of 104 megabytes per second (MB/s). (Though many cards are able to surpass that limit with proprietary tech and card readers.) The original Switch has a UHS-I microSD slot, as do most other gaming handhelds like Valve’s Steam Deck.\nUHS-II cards add a second row of pins and can reach up to 312 MB/s. These are pricier and much less common than cards based on UHS-I, but they’re supported by some cameras and higher-power handhelds like the ASUS ROG Ally X. UHS-III, meanwhile, is twice as fast as UHS-II in theory (624 MB/s), but no microSD cards have actually used it.\nUHS-I cards have held on over the years because they’re cheap, widely supported and fast enough for the things most people need them to do: record 4K video, stash photos and so on. But with the Switch 2, Nintendo needs more. The new console is dramatically more powerful, which allows it to run demanding games that may have originally been built for stronger hardware like the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X or gaming PCs. The device also uses UFS 3.1 storage internally, which is much speedier than the eMMC storage used by the original Switch. (A custom file decompression engine helps improve load times as well.) So if the Switch 2 is going to accept microSD cards, it needs ones that won’t bring a serious drop-off in performance and can hold up with modern games.\nThe Nintendo Switch 2.Sam Rutherford for Engadget\nHence, SD Express. This standard has technically been around since 2018 but mostly went nowhere until the Switch 2 came along. It also uses a second row of pins, but it lets microSD cards take advantage of the PCI Express (PCIe)/NVMe interface, which is the same underlying tech used by modern SSDs. As a result, it can produce considerably faster read and write speeds, with a current theoretical maximum of 985 MB/s.\nAs noted above, real-world performance won’t be quite that fast. Even if it was, the best microSD Express cards would still be much slower than the NVMe SSDs used by the PS5 and Xbox. (Sony recommends SSDs with sequential read speeds of at least 5,500 MB/s.) And they’ll fall well below their peak speeds under sustained loads: SanDisk, for instance, says sustained write speeds for its 128GB Express card can drop as low as 100 MB/s.\nBut they’re still a marked improvement over old UHS-I cards, and in theory, they should be quicker than some older SATA-based SSDs when it comes loading game levels, asset streaming, retrieving saves or copying games to external storage. Whereas SanDisk’s microSD Express card can produce sequential read speeds around 900 MB/s, Lexar’s Professional Silver Plus — the top UHS-I pick in our general microSD card guide — topped out just over 200 MB/s, and that’s with a proprietary reader. (On the first Switch, it’d be closer to 100 MB/s.) Sequential writes and random speeds were three to four times better as well, and sometimes even more depending on the benchmark we used.\nIt remains to be seen how well these Express cards will hold up with extended use, and there’s no way to know exactly when their sky-high prices will drop. Non-Switch 2 devices that support microSD Express are still exceedingly rare, and the standard itself isn’t backwards compatible with UHS-II, so you’ll be limited to UHS-I speeds if you want to use your card with another device (unless you buy a pricey external reader). Still, while the increased costs and limited selection are annoying, the tech itself seems worthy of a next-gen Switch.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/best-microsd-cards-for-nintendo-switch-2-160052947.html?src=rss",

AI performance between the two is essentially equal, with both exceeding the 40 trillion operations per second minimum set by Microsoft for its Copilot Plus PC platform -- laptops designed to handle AI tasks locally, on-device rather than through an internet-connected server somewhere else. These laptops have battery lives that can exceed 20 hours, but they also come with the trade-off of potential software compatibility issues. You'll find Ryzen AI 9 processors in gaming laptops and other high-powered models meant for serious graphics or scientific work. Thanks to Qualcomm, Windows laptops now offer the same long battery life as MacBooks that run on Apple's own Arm-based M-series processors. Largely based on their strength in single-core performance and backward compatibility, x86 chips have long dominated the desktop market. This does mean more instructions are often required for the same task, which limits performance compared to x86 chips. Microsoft setting a 40 TOPS minimum for its Copilot Plus PC platform set off an avalanche of NPU integrations in chipsets that previously had none. NPUs have the advantage of freeing up CPU and GPU cores for operations that they're better equipped to handle while being extremely power efficient. While the current slate of AI features built into Windows is a little lackluster (depending largely on how you feel about its controversial Recall function, which takes \"screenshots\" of your PC activity and lets you return to them at any time), the AI landscape is rapidly changing and evolving."

    "summary": "If you’re hunting for the best projector, there’s never been a better time to dive in. Projectors aren’t just for movie buffs anymore — they’ve become a great way to upgrade your living room setup, build a cozy home theater or even host an epic outdoor movie night under the stars. Whether you want something ultra-portable or a full-on 4K home cinema experience, there’s a projector out there to fit just about every space and budget.The cool thing about the projectors you can get today is how versatile they are. Some models are built for gaming, some are designed for streaming your favorite shows and others are tough enough to take camping or on the road. Plus, newer projectors pack in smart features, better brightness and sharper image quality than ever before, making them a real alternative to a traditional TV. No matter what you're aiming for, we'll help you find the right projector to upgrade your setup.\nTable of contents\n\nBest projectors for 2025\nWhat to look for in a projector\nBest projector FAQs\n\nBest projectors for 2025\nSome projectors are for serious cinephiles, projecting sharp 4K video with HDR brightness and hyper realistic colors to a large screen. Others are bright enough to replace your TV for sports or gaming, and some low-cost portable models can be set up for camping or outdoor fun. That’s why we’ve divided this guide into several categories to help you find the right one. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhat to look for in a projector\nFor a deep dive on projector technology check my previous explainer, but there are few key things to keep in mind. What will the projector mainly be used for? What type of room will it be used in? And how big of an image do you want? You’ll also see a variety of specifications that may be confusing, so here are a few to consider and what they mean.\nBrightness and contrast\nBrightness is measured in ANSI lumens; the brighter the projector, typically the more expensive it will be. 1,500-2,500 lumens is good for darkened rooms, 3,000-4,000 lumens allows you to see with some ambient light and 4,000+ lumens is bright enough to use in direct sunlight. High contrast is important, because projectors are more sensitive to things like ambient light and reflections.\nDLP vs LCD\nDigital light processing units (DLPs) used by Optoma, BenQ, LG and others allow bright 4K images. The negative is that they can produce a “rainbow” effect, or red/blue/green artifacts that affect some viewers more than others. LCDs are used mainly by Epson, but also Sony and Sanyo. Those are often brighter, more color accurate and don’t produce rainbow effects, but are also more expensive and susceptible to image degradation over time.\nResolution\nIf you want a true 4K projector, beware: only expensive models have native 4K resolution (many movie theaters still use 2K projectors for various reasons). However, most DLP projectors and some LCD models can use pixel-shifting to attain 4K resolution.\n\n\n\n\n   Elite Starling \n \n\nHDR and color accuracy\nProjectors can’t produce anywhere close to the amount of light required to qualify as true HDR. Rather, they use a technique called tone mapping to fit the entire HDR gamut into a lower brightness range. That said, many projectors can display millions of colors, with some models surpassing the color accuracy of TVs and monitors.\nUST vs. classic\nClassic projectors and screens can be mounted on the ceiling so they’re great if you have no floor space. They can also project a larger video for a truly cinematic experience. UST projectors mount on the floor right next to the screen so they can take the place of a TV. They don’t beam as big an image but are generally brighter, sharper and more expensive. For best results, they require special screens.\nMounting and fan noise\nCeiling mounting requires some work and don’t forget to budget for a bracket and any necessary long cables, including extra power for a Google Chromecast or other streaming device. UST projectors require less labor, but getting the image perfectly square can still be surprisingly time-consuming. As for fan noise, some projectors (usually cheaper DLP models) generate more than others.\nOptics\nFor more flexibility with location and image size, ceiling mounted projectors need a good zoom range. Lens shift, meanwhile, is used if the projector is mounted higher or lower relative to the screen than recommended by the manufacturer. Otherwise, you might have to use a \"keystone correction\" to digitally stretch part of the image, resulting in distortion or artifacts. Also, keystore correction may not work in gaming modes for some models.\nGaming and streaming\nIf you’re interested in a projector for gaming, look up the refresh rate and input lag figures. Some projectors offer good numbers in that regard (240Hz and <20 ms, respectively), but others designed for home entertainment have very poor input lag and refresh rates at just 60 Hz. If it’s streaming you want, be sure to pick a model either with built-in Google TV or a bundled streaming dongle.\nScreens\nShould you project onto a wall, roll-down screen, fixed screen or ambient light rejecting (ALR) screen? The choice depends largely on the room and what kind of projector you have. Roll down screens take up no space as they’re ceiling mounted, fixed screens can be moved easily and ALR models are perfect in rooms with a lot of ambient light.\nBest projector FAQs\nAre 4K projectors better?\nYes, because higher resolution is more noticeable on larger screens, so 4K is particularly useful with projectors since they beam images up to 200 inches in size. That being said, brightness and contrast are more important.\nIs a projector better than a TV?\nProjectors can provide a more immersive experience thanks to the large screen, but they’re not necessarily “better.” Since you usually have to dim the lights with a projector, TVs are superior for everyday use.\nIs 2000 lumens bright enough for a projector?\nYes, 2000 lumens is easily bright enough, even with some ambient light in the room. However, the image will still be hard to see with the windows open on a bright day.\nShould I get a 4K or 1080p projector?\nThat depends on your budget and needs. If your budget is below $1,000, look for a 1080p projector with the best brightness and contrast. Between $1,000-$2,000, you’ll need to weigh whether brightness or 4K resolution is most important. Above that, choose the brightest 4K projector you can afford.\nWhat are the best projectors in daylight?\nThe best projectors in daylight are ultra short throw (UST) models, as they have the brightest and sharpest image. However, they generally cost more than $2,000.\nDo you need a screen for a better projector experience?\nTechnically, you don’t need a screen to use a projector — any light-colored, smooth wall can work in a pinch. But if you want to get the most out of your projector, a screen can make a difference. Projector screens are designed to reflect light evenly and enhance contrast, so colors look more vibrant and the picture appears sharper. With a screen, you’ll notice darker blacks and brighter colors, which can give a real boost to your movie nights or gaming sessions. So while you can absolutely enjoy a projector without one, a screen can make the experience feel a bit more like your own personal theater.\nShould I buy a portable or home projector?\nIt depends on how and where you plan to use it. If you want a projector you can easily move around, bring to friends’ houses or set up indoors or outdoors easily, a portable projector is a great choice. They’re usually smaller, lightweight and often have built-in speakers and batteries, making them convenient for on-the-go use.\nOn the other hand, if you’re looking for a more permanent setup for a home theater or living room, a home projector might be the way to go. Home projectors tend to be more powerful, with higher resolution and brightness, which gives you that crisp, cinema-quality experience. They’re ideal if you have a dedicated space and don’t mind leaving it set up in one spot.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/best-projectors-123004354.html?src=rss",

It’s already up for preorder today for an October 1st ship date. […]",
    "full_text": "As you’ll see in the many images below, this Game Boy doesn’t rely on miniature hats for its iconic fuchsia A and B buttons — Lego has seemingly created pitch-perfect buttons that appear to recess into the frame. The console’s curves are also captured remarkably well! Lego’s going for a pristine look here — the link cable cover is intact rather than lost in someone’s couch! (That serial number has an easter egg, by the way.) But perhaps best of all, this Lego Game Boy can show off actual scenes from the classic games using swappable lenticular lenses that’ll show you different images when viewed from different angles. You can pop in a brick-built cartridge of The Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening or Super Mario Land, and “watch” the classic Nintendo logo drop as you rotate the screen downwards (you’ll have to imagine the Game Boy’s da-DING beep). Or, pop in a different lenticular lens to see Link cozy up to Marin on the beach in Awakening’s most bittersweet scene: Lego wants you to know it’s not a real display. I built Nick Lever’s fan-designed Lego Game Boy myself, and have the real deal that plays actual cartridges too, but I’m going to be mighty tempted to pick up the official Lego one as well. It’s on Instagram, and you may be able to play it (with a tap) in its embedded form below."

It calls for eliminating references to those items in the National Institute of Standards and Technology's AI Risk Management Framework. Federal agencies would only be allowed to contract with AI developers who \"ensure that their systems are objective and free from top-down ideological bias.\" An AI Workforce Research Hub under the Department of Labor would lead monitoring and issue policy recommendations.

Borrowers on the IBR can have the payments they made on other income-driven repayment plans (including SAVE, PAYE and ICR) count toward their IBR forgiveness. But one of SAVE's features allowed borrowers to count months in certain types of forbearance when they didn't make payments, according to student loan expert Mark Kantrowitz. IBR is an income-driven student loan repayment plan that adjusts monthly payments based on borrowers' income. Multiple paths to student loan forgiveness have disappeared in the past year. But it's understandable that borrowers -- deciphering confusing and misleading information as they wait for forgiveness -- may be skeptical of the Education Department's reassurances that IBR forgiveness is coming back. The Department of Education didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. Millions of borrowers enrolled in SAVE will start accruing interest on their loans again starting Aug. 1. You aren't required to switch plans until then, although interest will pile up during that time."

Your money grows faster, giving you a bigger balance to draw from when the time comes.

Retirement accounts like 401(k)s and IRAs are designed to help you maximize your tax advantages. While brief stock market swings can cause panic, investing is still critical for long-term financial stability.

Ookla is an internet speed-test company that collects data via its Speedtest.net tool, which gathers insights from millions of daily customer uses. For example, it can help you pinpoint when and where your connection may be laggy. Many things can affect a speed test, including whether or not you're using Wi-Fi or a hardwired Ethernet connection, the time of day you're running the test and so on.

This growth brings YouTube’s total ad revenue to $9.8 billion, up from $8.7 billion in the same period last year. The company slightly exceeded analyst expectations, which had forecast YouTube’s Q2 ad revenue to be around $9.6 billion. For years, YouTube has been striving to capture a larger share of television ad dollars, especially as its popularity in TV has grown, accounting for a significant portion of its viewership. A recent report from Nielsen indicated that YouTube held the largest share of TV viewing for three consecutive months, representing 12.4% of the total audience time spent watching television. In response to YouTube’s success, rival streaming services, such as HBO Max and Amazon Prime Video, have ramped up their advertising strategies, increasing ad placements to stimulate growth. Additionally, Netflix is emerging as a key competitor to YouTube, particularly after it announced its intentions to double its advertising revenue within the year during the company’s earnings call last week. Although Netflix has not publicly disclosed its ad revenue figures, an analyst from Madison & Wall estimates that it’s around $3 billion.

On Wednesday, Android Authority said it managed to uncover a banner of the Pixel 10, 10 Pro, 10 Pro XL, and 10 Pro Fold while “poking around” on the Google Play Store on Android. The banner doesn’t appear directly on the Play Store right now, which means Android Authority likely took some extra steps to enable it. Still, it clearly shows all four devices with the text, “Meet the new Pixel 10 Series.” The Pixel 10 Pro XL, 10 Pro Fold, and 10 Pro seem to appear in the silver-blue “Moonstone” color, while the base Pixel 10 is shown in bright blue. This is the banner that Android Authority got to surface on the Play Store. Image: Android Authority The designs — and colors — of the devices in the banner line up with the flood of leaks we’ve seen in recent weeks, including the teaser shared by Google itself. The banner also shows a promotion offering $50 off the devices that will remain in effect until October 13th."

    "summary": "After largely focusing Google I/O 2025 on the ways the company wants Gemini to change everything from searching the web to filmmaking, Google is finally ready to launch new hardware. The next Made by Google event is on the books for August 20, and Google has already confirmed what at least one of its new Pixel 10 phones will look like.\nAs in past years, Google isn't the only source for information on its new phones and wearables. Nearly all the new hardware the company is expected to announce has leaked in one form or another ahead of the event. With that in mind and after sifting through what's leaked, here's what Google is likely to show off at the Pixel 10 launch event in New York City on August 20.\nPixel 10, 10 Pro, 10 Pro XL and 10 Pro Fold\nAndroid Headlines / Onleaks \nGoogle's invitation for the event says that the company is sharing \"the latest on our Pixel phones, watches, buds and more,” which more or less confirms the company will introduce a slate of products that's similar to what it launched in 2024. That means a Pixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro, Pixel 10 Pro XL and Pixel 10 Pro Fold are absolutely on the menu.\nGoogle's tease of the Pixel 10 confirmed what leaked renders have already signaled: the company isn't abandoning the new design language the Pixel 9 established. The pill-shaped camera bump and flat front display will still be present on the Pixel 10, and the real changes will be in the details, like for example, how the flat sides of the Pixel 10 join with the phone's back.\nThose subtle changes will apparently also include the thickness of the Pixel 10s. While both the Pixel 10, 10 Pro, 10 Pro XL and 10 Pro Fold will use the same sized OLED screens as their Pixel 9 counterparts, they'll be housed in thicker and heavier bodies, according to Android Headlines. Google's new Pixels are also supposed to come in new colors. The Pixel 10 will come in \"Frost\" (a royal blue), \"Lemongrass\" (a yellow), \"Indigo\" (a light purple) and \"Obsidian\" (a dark gray), while the Pixel 10 Pro / Pro XL will come in Obsidian, \"Porcelain\" (off-white), \"Moonstone\" (a bluish gray) and \"Jade\" (a light green). Less information is known about the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, though recent leaks suggest it'll come in Moonstone and Jade, as well.\nAndroid Headlines\nThe most visible external change that'll be introduced on the Pixel 10 is the addition of a new telephoto camera. The new telephoto camera is a 11-megapixel 5x telephoto, Android Authority reports, similar to the one on the Pixel 9 Pro Fold. Meanwhile, the Pixel 10 Pro and 10 Pro XL are expected to feature a 50-megapixel wide, 48-megapixel ultrawide, 48-megapixel telephoto and 48-megapixel selfie cameras. The Pixel 10 Pro Fold could feature a different lineup, with a similar main camera, but 12-megapixel ultrawide and telephoto cameras, and 11-megapixel selfie cameras.\nInside the new phones, Google is laying the groundwork for future performance gains with a new Tensor G5 chip. It's likely be much more power-efficient thanks to the company switching to a 3nm design produced by TSMC. Reports suggest the chip might not be all that different in terms of raw power, but the Tensor G5 is likely designed to be extra capable when it comes to using local AI features.\nPixel Watch 4\n91mobiles / Onleaks\nThe third time was the charm for the Pixel Watch 3, so the main task Google has with the Pixel Watch 4 is to not squander the solid base it already has. Leaks for the company's new smartwatches have been limited so far, but renders of the Pixel Watch 4 shared by 91mobiles do suggest Google has a few changes planned.\nNamely, much like the company's phones, the new Pixel Watch seems like it'll be a little bit thicker and come with smaller bezels. The Pixel Watch 4 should be available to purchase in the same 41mm and 45mm sizes as before, but a thicker frame that could accommodate a larger battery, or a new wireless charging system. Notably, the renders are missing the charging pins used on the Pixel Watch 3.\nBeyond that, Google has already indicated how Wear OS is evolving. The new Wear OS 6 update is debuting on the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8, and will presumably be available on the Pixel Watch 4 at launch. It includes built-in access to Gemini, among other tweaks. Given Google also manages the Fitbit Premium subscription, it wouldn't be all that surprising if the Pixel Watch 4 gets some exclusive fitness tracking features, too.\nPixel Buds 2a\nBilly Steele for Engadget\nGoogle launched the Pixel Buds Pro 2 last year, and it typically doesn't update its premium earbuds on a yearly cadence. So instead, Tom's Guide reports Google might pair the Pixel 10 with the Pixel Buds Pro 2 in a new color, and save its new hardware announcements for a sequel to the Pixel Buds A-series called the Pixel Buds 2a.\nUnlike the company's premium wireless earbuds, the A-series Pixel Buds have historically skimped on things like active noise cancellation to hit a lower price. There's little reporting on where Google will take the Pixel Buds 2a, but you can expect the new earbuds to come in some of the new colors being introduced on the Pixel 10.\nPixelsnap\nThe Qi2 wireless charging standard is available for all phone makers to use, but it hasn't been widely adopted among Android phone makers. Qi2 uses magnets to offer improved charging speeds, just like Apple's MagSafe, and the Pixel 10 could mark Google's adoption of Qi2 through a new feature called \"Pixelsnap.\"\nA report from Android Authority suggests the Pixel 10 will include the necessary magnets to make Qi2 happen, and will be introduced alongside a lineup of Pixelsnap accessories. Adding some weight to the report, the Wireless Power Consortium has announced that its faster Qi2 25W charging is coming to \"major Android phones.\" It would make sense if Google's Pixel 10s were included.\nGemini and other exclusive software features\nGemini is Google's current favorite, and the company is pushing the AI assistant everywhere it makes sense. The last few Pixel Drops — Google's regular Pixel-focused software updates — have primarily included Gemini features. It would make sense for Google to include a few more software exclusives on the Pixel 10.\nGoogle is hosting the Pixel 10 launch event on August 20 at 1PM ET / 10AM ET. The company has invited press to attend in person, and you can read coverage of everything Google announces right here on Engadget.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/what-to-expect-at-the-google-pixel-10-launch-event-on-august-20-214510264.html?src=rss",

Carr’s proposal argues that this is a flawed way to measure progress toward closing the digital divide. It all hinges on one key sentence used in Section 706: “The Commission shall determine whether advanced telecommunications capability is being deployed to all Americans in a reasonable and timely fashion.” Carr’s proposal argues that the FCC has been (wrongly) measuring where broadband has been deployed already, not where it is in the process of being deployed. “That interpretation seemingly found anything short of 100% was insufficient to warrant a passing grade and thus disregarded Congress's use of the present progressive tense in ‘is being deployed.’” Section 706 requires that if broadband is not being deployed to all Americans, the FCC must “accelerate deployment of such capability by removing barriers to infrastructure investment and by promoting competition.” It says that the previous FCC read “several extraneous universal service criteria” into section 706. Most broadband experts agree that cost is the main reason people don’t have home internet, not a lack of availability."

In an example of \"the good kind,\" Google DeepMind has created an AI model that restores and contextualizes ancient inscriptions. Aeneas (no, it's not pronounced like that) is named after the hero in Roman mythology. Best of all, the tool is open-source and free to use.\nAncient Romans left behind a plethora of inscriptions. But these texts are often fragmented, weathered or defaced. Rebuilding the missing pieces is a grueling task that requires contextual cues.

(Think of it as filling out a crossword puzzle where you don't know how many letters are in each clue.) The tool is also multimodal, meaning it can analyze both textual and visual input. DeepMind says it's the first model that can use that multi-pronged method to figure out where a text came from.\nDeepMind says Aeneas is designed to be a collaborative ally within historians' existing workflows. It's best used to offer \"interpretable suggestions\" that serve as a starting point for researchers. \"Aeneas' parallels completely changed my perception of the inscription,\" an unnamed historian who tested the model wrote. \"It noticed details that made all the difference for restoring and chronologically attributing the text.\"\nAlongside the release of Aeneas for Latin text, DeepMind also upgraded Ithaca. (That's its model for Ancient Greek text.) Ithaca is now powered by Aeneas, receiving its contextual and restorative superpowers.\nResearchers can take Aeneas for a spin at DeepMind's \"Predicting the Past\" website.

    "full_text": "Got some subscriptions on an Apple device you're looking to cancel? You might be in for an extra step in the near future -- or a deal you decide you can't pass up. I don't know about you, but often when I'm trying cancel a subscription (like Starz, when Outlander isn't airing), I get an offer to stick around for a temporarily discounted price. It can be annoying sometimes, but I'd be lying if I said I've never taken them up on the deal. However you feel about that common customer retention practice, you can expect to see it on your Apple devices in the near future, according to findings from 9to5Mac. Spotted in the company's App Store documentation, developers now have a few options for presenting you with a further message whenever you attempt to end a subscription, including messages encouraging you to consider a different price tier, or a message offering you a promotional discount. At that point in the process, you'll still have the standard \"Confirm Cancellation\" and \"Don't Cancel\" options available to you, so no need to worry about further complications to cancellation beyond this extra decision. It comes just after the US Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals struck down the Federal Trade Commission's \"Click to Cancel\" rule, which sought to make cancelling subscriptions as simple as the push of one button. The rule might make a comeback soon, as the ruling was only because the FTC had not undertaken the necessary regulatory analysis for a move that would have an impact on the US economy greater than $1 million. Apple did not respond to CNET's request for comment prior to publication."

I should note that I performed this testing a couple days before T-Satellite went live, so it was technically during the T-Satellite beta period, and using a beta version of the Messages app on Android. The only difference over satellite is that it took around two and a half minutes to send. T-Mobile has cited AllTrails as an example of apps that'll be compatible with the service. But at one point after sending a message, some text below it said the app was waiting to connect. I also ran into some confusion with my iPhone 16 Pro running T-Satellite as a secondary eSIM. On further research, I discovered that an active third-party satellite connection shows \"SAT\" in the menu bar. Will satellite services cover the remaining dead zones and allow easy communication even in remote areas? As companies build up the capacity and performance of satellite services, it's easy to see a near future where you don't have to think about how you're getting data, just as we currently don't ever think about which cellular tower is relaying our data. As someone who lives in cellular-saturated Seattle, I probably won't need to rely on satellite data."

YC laid off most of the folks putting on this event between a small layoff about a year ago and a larger one in 2023. These layoffs were surprising at the time because Y Combinator’s events have always been highly popular and were a major force in making San Francisco the hub for the burgeoning AI startup community. (Of course, the center of that universe is YC-affiliated OpenAI, also headquartered in San Francisco and run by former YC president Sam Altman.) The people putting on this event are doing it because they are appalled at how often early-stage startups are led to believe they must pay tens of thousands of dollars to hire PR and social media agencies, one person involved told TechCrunch. Still, in the wake of startups that routinely go viral, like Cluely, founders feel pressured to do the same. It’s also true that a single social media post can make an early-stage startup go viral these days. The founders of app vibe coding startup Rork were almost broke when a viral tweet led them to raise $2.8 million and nab a spot in a16z’s Speedrun program. Defense tech startup Theseus landed a contract with the U.S. Special Forces, $4.3 million in funding, and a spot in YC, from a viral X post. If the folks behind the new event could help YC founders, they believe they can help founders who aren’t part of the famed program — and on the cheap without giving up equity."

Unfortunately, you can't simply get a $10 price adjustment. You'll have to refund the full $80 and then pre-order again for $70. I'm beginning to think consumer-friendliness isn't the priority here.\nThe $80 pricing push began with Mario Kart World. Comments by Gearbox CEO Randy Pitchford initially suggested Borderlands 4 might have followed. Fortunately, 2K Games saw something in the backlash that made it balk; it's launching at $70. A Bluesky user summed it up in a reply to Obsidian's U-turn. \"Consumer advocacy in this awful state of the industry WORKS,\" ‪@johnbrebbia posted.\nNintendo\nThe gaming industry is caught in a godawful whirlwind of layoffs, studio closures and price increases. That's happening against a backdrop of rising costs for consumers. Meanwhile, the gaming industry is projected to reach $189 billion this year, a 3.4 percent increase. That's a combustible mixture if ever there was one.\nIronically, Obsidian's sci-fi RPG deals with themes of late-stage capitalism. The developer even deployed in-world satire to announce the pricing change: \"Dear Galactic Citizens! We have received your SOS via skip drone about the pricing...\" Winking at one's audience is usually a good thing, but this strikes me as more of a \"dude, read the room\" moment.\nRegardless, The Outer Worlds 2 is set to arrive on October 29. It will be available for Xbox Series X/S, PS5 and PC.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/microsoft-backtracks-on-80-the-outer-worlds-2-pricing-173027532.html?src=rss",

    "full_text": "Open source X and Threads competitor Mastodon will begin experimenting with a new way to raise funds: in-app donations. The organization on Wednesday announced it’s launching a campaign that introduces banners inside its Android and iOS apps, prompting users to make a monetary donation. These banners will be easy to dismiss, Mastodon says, and will only be shown to people who have accounts that have existed for at least four weeks. The organization promises that it won’t continually prompt users to donate, either. Such campaigns can work well for nonprofit organizations at scale. Still, the banners could encourage people who haven’t actively sought out ways to contribute to now do so, as it makes the process more seamless as an in-app feature. The latter would allow individual server admins to receive direct support from their own users, which could help keep them operational. It has also accepted a handful of donations from open source-focused funds and foundations over the years. That decline could have pushed it to look into more aggressive fundraising tactics, especially as competition from Meta and newcomers like the VC-backed startup Bluesky is growing. “We know that collecting money can present complexities and questions,” a Mastodon blog post stated."

Any hypothetical hacker would not only have to be aware of the flaw, but would then have to trick their target into sending a web request over RDP or other traffic that uses port 3389. Even if all the dominos fell, the hacker could only see their target's real IP address, not any of the actual data they transmitted.\nEven if the danger was small, it's nice to see ExpressVPN responding proactively to flaws in its product — bug bounties are great, but a security product should protect its users with as many safeguards as possible. In addition to closing this vulnerability, they're also adding automated tests that check for debug code accidentally left in production builds.

    "summary": "2024 was an awful year for Sonos. Its long-awaited entry into a crowded headphones market was eclipsed by a bungled app launch which had a knock-on effect that impacted everything the company had planned to do for the rest of the year. Plus, those Ace headphones were missing a major feature.\nOne year later, that TrueCinema spatial audio enhancement is finally ready. And with that update, Sonos added a few more improvements to the Ace, including two-person TV Audio Swap, adaptive noise cancellation and better calls. I spent some time testing every aspect of the update that arrived in June to determine if Sonos’ headphones really are better after the tweaks.\nTrueCinema is finally here\nThe first time I tried the Ace at a press event last spring, TrueCinema was one of the main parts of the demo. From the jump, Sonos was clear this wouldn’t arrive when the headphones first went on sale, but I also didn’t expect the company to take a full year to have it ready.\nAs a refresher, TrueCinema is a feature for the Ace that takes into account the acoustics of the room where one of its soundbars is located. It then creates spatial audio for the headphones based on that info when TV Audio Swap is active. According to Sonos, it supposedly “understands the dynamics of your space, acoustically treats it and makes it sound like you have a beautifully tuned 3D audio system right in your headphones.” It’s similar to the company’s TruePlay tuning that calibrates its soundbars to your living room or home theater space.\nSonos has championed TrueCinema as a more realistic listening experience. Since it simulates the characteristics of the room, it’s supposed to make it seem like you aren’t wearing headphones at all. I’m not convinced on that point, but the feature does significantly enhance the spatial audio capabilities of the Ace for TV Audio Swap.\nFor example, subtle details in movies — things like footsteps, as well as various beeps, clicks and taps in Rogue One — are a lot more obvious with TrueCinema. There’s more overall depth and direction to the sound as well, which makes this the optimal mode for watching TV or movies with Sonos’ headphones. I’m confident my review score would’ve been higher if this was part of the original package since it makes such an obvious improvement to sound quality.\nTV Audio Swap for two\nBilly Steele for Engadget\nThe marquee feature for the Sonos Ace for the last year has been TV Audio Swap. This allows you to send the sound from a compatible Sonos soundbar to the headphones for an individual listening experience. Of course, this means you can watch an action flick at full volume after your family goes to bed or to tune in to a sporting event without annoying your partner. This has worked well for me both during my review and in the time since.\nUnfortunately, I don’t have a second pair of the Ace, so I can’t vouch for how well TV Audio Swap now works with a companion. But since the ability to send soundbar audio to two sets of Ace headphones is one of the main items in the recent software update, I can’t discuss the overall state of the device without mentioning this feature’s availability.\nImproved ANC and clearer calls\nAnother aspect of the Ace’s update is improved active noise cancellation (ANC), but not in the way you might expect. The company didn’t figure out a way to block more noise per se, but it does account for any sound leaks that may impact performance. Sonos says its refined ANC setup can adapt to changes in fit caused by hair, glasses and hats in real time using the sensors inside the Ace. With that tweak, I noticed the slightest difference in ANC performance when sunglasses or a hat kept the ear pads from sitting flush on my face, but it’s not quite as good as a tight seal. I’d characterize this update as a modest improvement, but it’s still an improvement nonetheless.\nSonos also claims that this software update offers an improved call experience thanks to higher resolution audio. The company also added Sidetone, or the ability for you to pipe in your voice during calls when ANC is enabled. Plenty of companies have this, to varying degrees, and the effectiveness depends on how natural the sound is and whether or not you’re able to make any adjustments. In the case of the Ace, Sidetone acts as an enhanced ambient mode, and it definitely improves the call experience. Since I could speak normally and didn’t feel the need to shout to hear myself, video and voice calls felt more natural.\nWrap-up\nA year after their debut, the Sonos Ace is living up to the lofty expectations the company set when the headphones arrived. After spending time with this batch of updates, I’m convinced the Ace would’ve benefitted from having all of this ready at launch, especially TrueCinema. Since one of the Ace’s main functions is personal living room listening, taking so long to deliver the feature that would boost sound quality this much is another misstep.\nOn the other hand, it’s good to see Sonos is still working to improve the Ace. When you consider the company spent most of 2024 fixing a majorly botched app redesign, it would have been understandable if Sonos left the Ace to languish until it was time for version 2.0. The company had to delay products last summer, and according to a report in March, it even canceled another entirely. When CEO Patrick Spence resigned in January, interim chief executive Tom Conrad expressed the need for “getting back to basics” (Conrad was named permanent CEO on July 23). Improving a major new product that was overshadowed by a poor run of form is certainly one way to reclaim some of your reputation. It also doesn’t hurt that the Ace is currently available for $149 less than its original $449 price.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/a-year-later-the-sonos-ace-is-finally-fulfilling-its-potential-170035355.html?src=rss",

Critics have accused xAI of bypassing environmental safeguards and exposing residents to harmful emissions from gas-powered turbines with its Memphis data center. Tying back to other Trump themes of beating China, the strategy focuses on locking out foreign tech and emphasizing security protections to keep “adversarial technology” — like Chinese-made chips and hardware — out of the U.S. supply chain. One of the recommended policy actions is to update federal procurement guidelines to ensure the government only contracts with frontier large language model developers who “ensure their systems are objective and free from top-down ideological bias.” The implications of Trump’s policy suggestion and his impending executive order, could be far-reaching. He added: “If the order instructs agencies to select AIs based on a combination of accuracy and neutrality, leaving each agency with some latitude to decide what that means, that might be more viable.” These resources are expensive and typically were only possible for tech companies that could strike million- or billion-dollar contracts with cloud providers. Under Trump’s plan, federal agencies will work together to collect intelligence on foreign frontier AI projects that could threaten American national security. These groups will also conduct assessments on the level of AI adoption among America’s adversaries."

    "full_text": "This includes moving a cursor, opening apps, and sending messages by writing in the air as if using a pencil. Meta’s wristband employs a technique called surface electromyography (sEMG), which detects electrical signals generated by muscle activity to interpret user movements, as explained in a research paper published in the journal Nature. These signals can sense a person’s intended actions, even before they do them. The goal of this wristband is to provide less invasive tools to interact with computers for people with motor disabilities. The company is collaborating with Carnegie Mellon to test the wristband with people who have spinal cord injuries, enabling them to use computers even if they are unable to fully use their arms or hands. Douglas Weber, a professor in the Department of Mechanical Engineering and the Neuroscience Institute, noted that even people with complete hand paralysis still exhibit some muscle activity. As a result, the device is able to interpret their intended actions. The wristband is a simpler alternative to other projects, such as Elon Musk’s Neuralink, which aims to implant brain chips in individuals with severe paralysis. Other non-invasive approaches include headsets that utilize electroencephalogram (EEG) signals; however, these have limitations due to the weak signals they produce. Meanwhile, Meta’s wristband could be used immediately without surgical intervention, and its use of sEMG signals means it operates at a higher frequency than EEG."

    "summary": "My dream projector delivers the brightest and sharpest image. But it also has to be easy to move around and set up anywhere — especially outdoors. Anker’s Nebula X1 long-throw projector promises all of that with a three-laser engine that beams out a category-leading 3,500 ANSI lumens at 4K resolution. It also has features never seen before on a home projector, like liquid cooling to reduce fan noise and a motorized lens gimbal that automates setup. Plus, it offers good sound that can be upgraded with optional satellite speakers.\nThe rub is the price. At $3,000 ($3,298 with the satellite speakers for a limited time) it’s one of the more expensive consumer projectors, right up there with models like Epson’s LS11000 or the Valerion VisionMaster Pro2. After testing it, I can say that it offers the clearest, most vivid image quality I’ve seen and has the simplest setup to boot. However, the high price puts it far out of reach for most portable projector buyers. \n\n\nFeatures and design\nThe Nebula X1 follows in the footsteps of other Anker projectors, like the original Nebula and Cosmos, with a tall rectangular design and handle that neatly retracts with a press. While that makes it easy to carry, it also means the Nebula X1 hangs down more than most indoor projectors when ceiling-mounted.\nTo eliminate the tedious setup that typically plagues projectors, Anker did a clever thing: it placed the lens mechanism on a gimbal that can tilt up to 25 degrees. When combined with a 1.67x zoom, autofocus, keystone correction and ambient light detection, the projector fully automates setup. First, you have to choose a screen or wall location and position the projector at a prescribed distance between 8 and 35 feet, depending on the screen or wall size. You should center the projector as well as you can to avoid any digital (keystone) correction that can adversely affect image quality. Then the magic happens at the press of a button.\nThe Nebula X1 uses a function it calls Spatial Adaptation to scan the area in front of it. The lens tilts up and down, before displaying a checkerboard pattern and then beaming the final image pretty much precisely where it should be. It’s not perfect, as some obstacles like small plants or fine wires can throw it off, but it worked nicely for me on both a wall and dedicated screen. The projector can adapt to ambient light and even the wall color, and another function called Spatial Recall lets you save those settings for frequently used locations.\n\n\n\n  The Nebula X1's Spatial Adaptation feature in action.\n \n\n  Steve Dent for Engadget\n \n\nLaser engines get hot and are normally cooled with fans that can generate distracting noise. However, the Nebula X1 is the first consumer model with liquid cooling which reduces fan noise to a barely audible 26dB whisper. Thanks to this cooling system, the projector can also have a smaller footprint. That’s a big quality-of-life improvement compared to much of the competition.\nAs for inputs, the X1 comes with two HDMI 2.1 ports, including one with Enhanced Audio Return Channel (eARC) functionality. That standard supports fast refresh rates of up to 240Hz at 4K, though the X1 tops out at 4K 60Hz so it’s not ideal as a gaming projector. It also offers USB Type-A and USB Type-C ports, along with a S/PDIF optical audio port.\nGoogle TV is built in for streaming and projector control. It provides a large library of apps via Google Play along with a familiar interface. You also get Netflix’s official application with support for 4K Dolby Vision without the need to plug in a streaming device, plus Chromecast support and Google Assistant for voice control. The downside is that it can occasionally be sluggish, particularly with menu settings like projector image control.\nImage quality\n\n\n\n\n  Steve Dent for Engadget\n \n\nAnker uses what it calls “cinema-grade glass” in the Nebula’s 14-element lens to increase brightness, color accuracy and lens durability. The 4K triple laser engine is rated at up to 3,500 ANSI lumens with a 5,000:1 contrast ratio. At the same time, it offers color accuracy with a Delta E value of less than 0.8 and an impressive 110 percent of the Rec.2020 color spectrum, matching high-end ultra short throw (UST) models from Samsung, LG and Formovie. That 4K Dolby Vision support I mentioned is also rare among the competition.\nThe result is the sharpest and brightest image I’ve seen on any projector in this price range. It was bright enough for me to comfortably watch a soccer match on a sunny day without the shades lowered. And if you switch it to Conference mode, you can ramp the brightness up further for a viewable image even with lights on, but there’s the downside of a slight blue color cast.\nWhen used in a darkened room or outside at night, the Nebula’s image quality is the best of any projector I’ve tested. Even though it uses the same Texas Instruments 0.47-inch DMD (digital mirror device) as many other 4K models, the image is clearer and sharper thanks to the glass element lens. Contrast and black levels are also tops in this price range and not far off high-end projectors from JVC and Sony that cost twice as much. Once again, that’s due to the optics along with Anker’s 6-blade dynamic iris — another feature usually only found on high-end projectors — and the company’s “NebulaMaster 2.0” picture quality algorithm.\nColor accuracy is outstanding out of the box in both HDR and non-HDR modes thanks to the ISF (Image Science Foundation) certification normally reserved for more expensive projectors. In fact, I found the color calibration nearly perfect on my unit in “ISF Night” mode. That meant images were close to how they were calibrated by the filmmakers for TV series and movies like Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, Andor, Dune 2 and Spider-Man: No Way Home. If the colors aren’t quite to your liking, you can make fine adjustments manually. Like many other 4K projectors of this type, the X1 has a slight amount of light spill around the edge of the image. However, it’s well-controlled and only noticeable when the projected image is particularly dark.\nSound\n\n\n\n\n  Steve Dent for Engadget\n \n\nAnker put some extra work into the sound as well. Audio quality is solid thanks to the four built-in speakers with 40 watts total output. The lack of fan noise is a big help here. By itself, the X1 offers decent high-end and bass, but more importantly, dialog is easy to hear and understand.\nFor a big sonic upgrade, you can add a pair of Anker’s optional Nebula-branded satellite speakers that connect to the projector automatically via Wi-Fi. Each one has a pair of 40-watt front drivers, a 20-watt upward-firing driver and a 20-watt side-firing driver that combine to create a surround effect. Together with the projector, they deliver an impressive 200 watts of sound with Dolby Audio support (though not Dolby Atmos unfortunately). They’re also battery-powered with up to eight hours of use, which is especially handy for outdoor viewing. However, that also means you need to keep them charged.\nTo test these speakers, I selected several music-oriented movies including A Complete Unknown, Maestro and Rocketman, along with an action movie that has an impressive score and sound effects, Dune 2. In spite of their small size, the satellite speakers kept elements like music, dialog and sound effects crisp, clear and evenly balanced with powerful dynamic bass. You could certainly do better with a dedicated 5.1 or 7.1 surround sound system, but these speakers offer very respectable audio quality, are easy to set up and automatically sync with the picture. The X1 also supports other external Bluetooth speakers, but you may have to adjust the timing in the menus to ensure perfect sync for picture and sound.\nAnker also offers a $4,000 package that includes a pair of its Soundcore microphones along with the speakers. Those also connect to the X1 automatically and let you use it as a very expensive karaoke machine. They provide clear sound but you don’t get the usual benefits of a karaoke setup like AI vocal removal and vocal enhancement.\nWrap-up\n\n\n\n  The Nebula X1 offers a pair of HDMI 2.1 ports along with USB-C, USB-A and S/PIDF\n \n\n  Steve Dent for Engadget\n \n\nThe Nebula X1 is an odd proposition. It’s marketed as a portable outdoor projector, but it also happens to be the best indoor projector I’ve ever tested. With an impeccably sharp, high-contrast and color-accurate image, the video quality is irreproachable. The ease of setup and overall size also makes it an outstanding choice if you want to move the X1 around. With the optional satellite speakers, it’s the best portable projector you can get, hands down.\nThe Nebula X1 doesn’t have a lot of competition in the portable category, apart from Valerion’s $3,000 VisionMaster Pro 2, which also has a 4K triple laser engine. However, the X1 beats that model on image quality, portability and ease of setup.\nThe thing is, most people looking for a portable projector won’t spend more than $500, let alone $3,000. So who is this for? I think it’s ideal for buyers looking at a UST or high-end long-throw projector who want a bit more versatility. Some may even use it as a standalone indoor projector as it can be mounted on the ceiling or on a stand. In other words, if you have the means, use it any way you want — it’s that versatile.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/anker-nebula-x1-projector-review-the-king-of-outdoor-movies-if-you-can-afford-it-161519956.html?src=rss",

And like with its best known service, Proton Mail, the company says Lumo is for those who want a private alternative to what big tech is offering.\nProton says every conversation with Lumo is secured with zero-access encryption, meaning only your device can unlock your content. In the context of an AI chatbot, that has several implications. Most notably, it means not even Proton can view your chats. As a result, the company can't share your data with governments, advertisers or, for that matter, any other company, and it can't use your data to train future AI models. \"By using Lumo, you can enjoy the benefits of an advanced AI assistant without the risk of your data being misused,\" says Proton.\nI briefly tried Lumo. It's a bit slow to generate a response, but you can broadly expect a similar experience to what you would find using ChatGPT or Claude for free. Lumo can search the web to answer questions beyond its knowledge cut-off date, but by default that feature is turned off to further protect user privacy. You can also upload files to Lumo. Here again Proton says the chatbot won't save any information.\nProton isn't touting the performance of Lumo's large language models, but if you're curious about this sort of thing, it's powered by a handful of open-source systems, including Mistral NeMo and Mistral Small 3, among others. Proton told The Verge Lumo will filter requests through the model best suited for the task. For example, it will use NVIDIA's OpenHands system for coding requests.\nLumo is free to use, with a weekly query limit. You don't need a Proton account to begin a conversation with the chatbot. In addition to being available on the web, Proton offers both Android and iOS apps. A $13 per month Plus plan offers unlimited usage, alongside perks like larger uploads, access to more advanced AI models, priority support and more.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/protons-privacy-focused-lumo-chatbot-encrypts-all-your-conversations-144551345.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Apple has introduced a new tier of its AppleCare insurance policy called AppleCare One. This allows you to cover up to three of your Apple products under a single plan for $20 per month. If you want to add extra devices beyond that, you can do so for an additional $6 per month, per product.\nApple first introduced AppleCare+ in 2011 as a means of insuring your iPhone against accidental damage, and has since expanded the plan to its entire product line, adding coverage for theft and loss. Currently, AppleCare+ costs from $10 per month to insure an individual iPhone, with subscription prices starting at $3.49 per month for a Mac, and $5 for an iPad, depending on the model you own. You can also insure your Apple Watch, Vision Pro headset, AirPods, Apple TV and HomePod either individually, or as part of your new AppleCare One plan.\nAppleCare One features all the same benefits as AppleCare+, including unlimited repairs for accidents such as drops and spills, round-the-clock support from Apple experts, servicing and battery coverage. The theft and loss protection that was previously exclusive to iPhone plans now also covers iPad and Apple Watch if they’re included in your AppleCare One plan. You can make up to three claims a year for theft or loss of an iPhone, iPad or Apple Watch.\nThe $20 monthly price is fixed regardless of which products you include (as is the $6 you pay to add an additional device), meaning the amount you actually save will depend on what they would cost to insure individually, so it’s worth looking into that before you take out the new plan. Apple says that people who cover their iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch could save as much as $11 per month on AppleCare One compared to what they’d pay if each device was insured under AppleCare+.\nAlso new with AppleCare One is the ability to add devices you already own to a protection plan. Previously you’d have to decide within 60 days of purchasing an Apple device. Apple says that providing they’re under four years old, are in good condition when added and are in your Apple account, they can be covered under AppleCare One. You may need to run a diagnostic check either on the device itself or at an Apple Store to get it approved.\nAppleCare One also simplifies the trade-in process. If you trade in a product covered by your plan directly to Apple, it is automatically taken out and replaced by the new device. Unlike AppleCare+, though, there doesn’t appear to be a way to pay annually for your plan. Instead, it rolls monthly for as long as you need it, and Apple will let you move products in and out of coverage whenever you want.\nAppleCare One launches tomorrow in the US, and can be activated either on your iPhone, Mac or iPad, or in an Apple Store.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/applecare-one-lets-you-protect-three-devices-under-one-subscription-135559271.html?src=rss",

    "full_text": "The Switch 2 Pro controller is the best controller Nintendo has ever made – and that’s saying something. It’s incredibly comfortable to hold, its joysticks are buttery smooth, and all of its buttons are wonderfully responsive. Nintendo even made it customizable this time with rear buttons that can easily be mapped inside of any game. The Switch 2 Pro Controller costs $85, which seems a bit egregious when you can get an excellent controller like 8BitDo’s Ultimate 2 wireless gamepad for $60. As good as the competition is, though, you won’t find anything that can be easily configured directly from within the Switch 2’s user interface. My hands often feel cramped when I play that game with the Switch 2’s Joy-Con 2 controllers for too long. But there’s none of that with the Switch 2 Pro controller. I was able to race for an hour without any discomfort, and I also noticed that it was easier for me to pull off the game’s tricky jump maneuvers and rail sliding. The Switch 2 Pro controller is also seriously helpful with fighting games, thanks to its smooth and accurate directional pad. It acquits itself to most genres easily, though it would have been nice to see analog triggers for more precise control in serious racing games."

Microsoft blamed the attack on state-sponsored Chinese hackers. \"It's a dream for ransomware operators,\" Google's Threat Intelligence Group said, adding that the flaw allows \"persistent, unauthenticated access that can bypass future patching.\" Attackers also accessed the US Education Department and Florida's Department of Revenue, along with government systems in other nations including the Middle East and Europe. Microsoft announced on Monday that it had released a new security patch \"to mitigate active attacks targeting on-premises [and not online] servers.\""

    "summary": "Meta is adding some of its teen safety features to Instagram accounts featuring children, even if they're ran by adults. While children under 13 years of age aren't allowed to sign up on the social media app, Meta allows adults like parents and managers to run accounts for children and post videos and photos of them. The company says that these accounts are \"overwhelmingly used in benign ways,\" but they're also targeted by predators who leave sexual comments and ask for sexual images in DMs. \nIn the coming months, the company is giving these adult-ran kid accounts its strictest message settings to prevent unsavory DMs. It will also automatically turn on Hidden Words for them so that account owners can filter out unwanted comments on their posts. In addition, Meta will avoid recommending them to accounts blocked by teen users to lessen the chances predators finding them. The company will also make it harder for suspicious users to find them through search and will hide comments from potentially suspicious adults on their posts. Meta says will continue \"to take aggressive action\" on accounts breaking its rules: It has already removed 135,000 Instagram accounts for leaving sexual comments on and requesting sexual images from adult-managed accounts featuring children earlier this year. It also deleted an additional, 500,000 Facebook and Instagram accounts linked to those original ones.\nMeta introduced teen accounts on Instagram last year to automatically opt users 13 to 18 years of age into stricter privacy features. The company then launched teen accounts on Facebook and Messenger in April and is even testing AI age-detection tech to determine whether a supposed adult user has lied about their birthday so they could be moved to a teen account if needed. \nSince then, Meta has rolled out more and more safety features meant for younger teens. It released Location Notice in June to let younger teens know that they're chatting with someone from another country, since sextortion scammers typically lie about their location. (To note, authorities have observed a huge increase in \"sextortion\" cases involving kids being threatened online to send explicit images.) Meta also introduced a nudity protection feature, which blurs images in DM detected as containing nudity, since sextortion scammers may send nude pictures first in an effort to convince a victim to send reciprocate. \nToday, Meta is also launching new ways for teens to view safety tips. When they chat with someone in DMs, they can now tap on the \"Safety Tips\" icon at the top of the conversation to bring up a screen where they can restrict, block or report the other user. Meta has also launched a combined block and report option in DMs, so that users can take both actions together in one tap. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/meta-is-adding-new-safety-features-to-kid-focused-ig-accounts-run-by-adults-110000524.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Whether you're backing up important files, editing videos on the go or just freeing up space on your laptop, a fast and reliable SSD drive can make your workflow a whole lot smoother. The best portable SSD options in 2025 combine speed, durability and wide compatibility, often using USB Type-C connections for quick transfers across devices. Unlike a traditional thumb drive or even the best external hard drives, these compact powerhouses can offer faster read speeds, often hitting several hundred or even thousands of Mbps, especially with high-performance NVMe SSD models.Whether you're managing large files or launching apps directly from your drive, we've rounded up the best SSDs that deliver excellent performance without weighing you down.\nTable of contents\n\nBest external SSDs for 2025\nOther external SSDs we tested\nWhat to consider before buying an external SSD\nHow we test external SSDs\nRecent updates\n\nBest external SSDs for 2025\n \n \n \nOther external SSDs we tested\nThe pre-built OWC Express 1M2 is a premium-feeling USB4 SSD that’s roughly as fast as the ADATA SE920, but it’s larger and significantly more expensive as of this writing. \nIf you’re in the relatively small group with a PC that supports USB 3.2 Gen 2x2 but not Thunderbolt or USB4, the Crucial X10 Pro is essentially a faster version of our top pick. The Lexar SL600 is a larger but slightly quicker option, while the Lexar SL500, Kingston XS2000 or Samsung T9 could also work if you see them on discount. As a reminder, though, drives like these are aimed primarily at content creators and other professionals, and you have to make sure you won’t upgrade to a device with a faster USB interface anytime soon.\nThe Samsung T7 Shield has a conveniently rugged design with a rubberized, IP65-rated shell. It also comes with both USB-C and USB-A cables. But it was consistently slower than the X9 Pro and XS1000 in our benchmark tests, plus it has a shorter three-year warranty.\nThe Silicon Power PX10 is an especially affordable USB 3.2 Gen 2 model. Its peak speeds weren’t too far off the X9 Pro or XS1000 in synthetic benchmarks, but it can get distractingly hot and its sustained writes are markedly worse. It took 50 seconds longer to move our 70GB custom test folder to this drive compared to the X9 Pro, for example.\nThe Crucial X6 is another low-cost option that’s a good bit slower than our top picks. It’s limited to a three-year warranty and lacks an IP rating as well. It’s not a terrible option for the basics, but there’s little reason to get it over the XS1000 when their prices are similar.\nThe OWC Envoy Pro FX is well-built and supports Thunderbolt 3 and USB 3.2 Gen 2, but it’s a smidge slower than the SE920 and Express 1M2, and it’s much pricier than the former.\n\n\n\n   The Samsung T9 portable SSD. \n \n\n   Samsung \n \n\nWhat to consider before buying an external SSD\nCapacity\nThe first thing to figure out before buying a portable SSD is just how much storage space you need. Most of the SSD drives we considered for this guide are available in capacities ranging from one to four terabytes, though plenty of smaller and larger options exist.\nThere’s no hard-and-fast rule for which size is “best” — that’ll ultimately depend on your budget and what exactly you’re looking to stash. But in general, it’s better to overcompensate than underdo it. Nobody wants to be forced into buying a second drive because they filled the first one up too quickly. If you’re backing up a PC, a good rule of thumb is to buy an external SSD with twice as much space as your computer’s internal storage. This way, you can save at least one full backup while also having room for additional data. If you want to store a bunch of PlayStation or Xbox games with huge install sizes, you may need more space. If you just want to back up a small collection of files, you may be better off saving your cash and just getting a smaller USB flash drive or thumb drive instead, which aren’t quite the same as the best portable SSDs we tested for this guide.\nPrice\nIn general, you get a better price-per-gigabyte ratio the further you go up the capacity ladder. As of this writing, the 1TB Samsung T9 is priced at $130, or $0.13 per gigabyte (GB), while the 4TB version is available for $297 or $0.07 per GB. That technically makes the larger model a better “value,” but not everyone needs to pay that much more upfront.\nSSDs in the same speed class tend to not vary too wildly in terms of performance, so part of our decision-making for this guide came down to which ones are often the cheapest. But prices can fluctuate over time; if you see that one of our top picks is priced way higher than a comparable honorable mention, feel free to get the latter. At this point in time, costs are broadly trending upwards for even the best SSDs.\n\n\n\n   The ADATA SE920 portable SSD connected to an Apple MacBook Pro. \n \n\n   Photo by Jeff Dunn / Engadget \n \n\nSpeed and USB interface\nJust about all external SSDs are significantly faster than mechanical hard disk drives (HDDs), so you’ll save time waiting for files to transfer and games to load no matter what. Within the market, however, there are distinct performance tiers. These are defined in large part by the USB interface a drive supports. While all of the SSDs we considered for this guide can connect over USB Type-C, some USB-C connections can supply faster transfer speeds than others. Sorting through this can get real confusing real fast, so we’ll try to put it in simple terms.\nYou can essentially divide today’s crop of portable SSDs into different segments. At the very top are drives that utilize the (relatively) new Thunderbolt 5 standard, which has a theoretical maximum transfer rate of 80 gigabits per second (Gbps). (You may see it advertise speeds up to 120 Gbps, but that boost doesn’t apply to storage devices.) But portable SSDs that support this tech only just started to trickle out toward the end of 2024, and the market for devices with Thunderbolt 5 ports is still fairly limited, with the most notable exceptions being Apple’s top-end Macs with an M4 Pro or M4 Max chip.\nThunderbolt 5 is built on a spec called USB4, which can technically reach up to 80 Gbps as well but is more typically available in a flavor that tops out at 40 Gbps. Portable SSDs based on that standard started to roll out toward the end of 2023 but are still relatively infrequent. The older Thunderbolt 3 and Thunderbolt 4, which other high-end external SSDs continue to use, support the same 40 Gbps maximum.\nA third version of USB4, meanwhile, maxes at 20 Gbps, as does an older yet more frequently used standard called USB 3.2 Gen 2x2. Below that is USB 3.2 Gen 2, which maxes at 10 Gbps. Then there’s USB 3.2 Gen 1, which is capped at 5 Gbps. Lastly, we’ll bundle together SSDs that use older standards and aren’t worth considering here.\nTo make this easy: For everyday folks, a good USB 3.2 Gen 2 drive is the sweet spot between fast-enough performance, wide-enough compatibility and cheap-enough price, so those make up our primary recommendations above. If you work in a creative field or don’t mind paying extra to shave seconds off your large file transfers, though, a “higher-tier” model would make sense. However, note that actual computers that utilize USB 3.2 Gen 2x2 aren’t super common — no Mac supports it, for one — and the interface is effectively being replaced by USB4.\nIn general, your chain is only as strong as its weakest link: If your computer only has USB 3.2 Gen 2 ports, for example, you could still use a Thunderbolt SSD, but you won’t get beyond Gen 2 speeds. Make sure you know what you’re working with before you buy.\nAs a refresher, storage devices are broadly measured in terms of read speeds and write speeds. The former refers to how long it takes to access something from the drive; the latter, how long it takes to save something to it. From there, you can break these metrics into sequential and random performance. Sequential speeds tend to matter more with portable SSDs, since most people use them to save or access long, constant streams of data such as a bunch of high-res photos. Random speeds would be important if you want to run video games or apps off the drive, since that’d involve reading and writing smaller, more scattered files. Either way, how well an SSD can sustain its performance with extended use is also critical.\nOther performance factors and enclosures\nA modern portable SSD’s speeds aren’t just about its USB interface, though. Its performance can also depend on how advanced its controller is, whether it has a native USB flash controller or a separate bridge chip to communicate with a host device, the kind and quality of NAND flash memory it uses, whether it has a DRAM cache or it’s DRAM-less, and more.\nWe’re simplifying things, but here are some quick tips: Drives with triple-level cell (TLC) memory aren’t as cheap as quad-level cell (QLC) SSDs, but they’re generally more reliable and they offer better write performance. Having a dedicated DRAM cache helps if you plan to hit your drive with more intense, sustained workloads, but may not be worth the extra cost for most people. Some models with native flash controllers may not perform as well as those with a bridging chip, depending on the SSD inside, but they typically draw less heat and are physically smaller. All of this is to say that an external SSD’s speeds aren’t quite as straightforward as what the manufacturer chooses to advertise on the box.\nIt’s also worth remembering that you can turn an internal SSD into a portable solution with a good enclosure. If you have a spare drive and don’t mind going the DIY route, this can be a cheaper and more flexible solution, though we’ve stuck to pre-built models for this guide for the sake of simplicity.\n\n\n\n\n   Photo by Jeff Dunn / Engadget \n \n\nSize, durability, endurance and warranty\nMost portable SSDs are impressively small and light, so they won’t be difficult to tuck in a bag (or even a pocket) and take on the go. We note above if any drive is bulkier than usual.\nNothing we’re talking about matters if your drive can’t last in the long term. It’s hard to definitively say which external SSDs are the most reliable, but we scoured through user reviews and feedback while researching this guide to ensure none of our picks show a pattern of catastrophic errors. If there was too much smoke around a particular model, we steered clear. We ruled out certain drives from SanDisk and Western Digital, for instance, after reports from Ars Technica and The Verge noted an issue that led to data loss (and lawsuits) in 2023.\nThat said, one of the big reasons you’d buy an SSD in general is its superior durability. Because it has no moving mechanical parts inside, an SSD has far fewer avenues to failure than an external hard drive. You still don’t want to be careless with them, but an accidental drop shouldn’t be the end of the world.\nSome portable SSDs build on this inherent ruggedness with plastic or rubberized casings and more robust waterproofing. These aren’t necessary for everyone, but if you’re a frequent traveler or someone who often works outdoors, there are options for you.\nStill, all drives can fail. If you have any sort of data you’d be distraught to lose, you should back it up regularly, then make a second backup, ideally with a cloud service. Along those protective lines, we also took note of the warranty policy for each drive we tested. Just about all of them are backed for either three or five years; of course, longer is better.\nEncryption and software\nIt’s not uncommon to store sensitive data on a portable SSD, so some models offer extra security features like hardware-based encryption — i.e., direct scrambling of data stored on the drive itself — built-in keypads and fingerprint readers to protect against unauthorized access if the drive is lost or stolen. While not top requirements, perks like these are certainly good to have. Some SSDs also come with companion software to further manage the drive. The best of those can be handy to have around, but we wouldn’t call them essential.\nHow we test external SSDs\nUnfortunately, we did not have access to a device that can make full use of USB 3.2 Gen 2, USB 3.2 Gen 2x2 and Thunderbolt/USB4 speeds interchangeably, so we had to split our testing across multiple devices, including an M1 Pro MacBook Pro and an Alienware gaming PC running Windows 11. Because of this, we primarily compared the portable SSDs within each “class” against one another. Before switching OSes, we reformatted each drive to each platform’s standard file system format: APFS for macOS and NTFS for Windows.\nAfter researching which SSDs had enough positive feedback to be worth testing in the first place, we put 13 drives through a range of synthetic and “real-world” benchmark tests. On Windows, these included CrystalDiskMark, PCMark 10’s Data Drive Benchmark and 3DMark’s gaming-focused Storage Benchmark. On macOS, we used AmorphousDiskMark (effectively a Mac version of CrystalDiskMark), BlackMagic Disk Speed Test and ATTO Disk Benchmark.\nWe also timed how long it took for each drive to read and write a custom 70GB folder filled with roughly 11,500 different files, including photos, videos, music files, PDFs and other large and small data types scattered across numerous subfolders. We performed multiple passes for each test to avoid irregularities, and we kept track of each SSD’s heat levels over the course of the whole suite. Our process wasn't a perfect science, but it gave us a general sense of how each drive compares to other models in its price and performance range.\nRecent updates\nFebruary 2025: We’ve checked to ensure the pricing info and links in this guide are still accurate. We’ve also added details on the (relatively) new Thunderbolt 5 interface, which has been implemented in a couple recent portable SSDs like the OWC Envoy Ultra and LaCie Rugged SSD Pro5. We’ll look to include testing notes for those for our next update, as they should be faster than the ADATA SE920, our current premium pick, albeit for a much higher price. For now, though, our top picks remain the same.\nOctober 2024: We’ve taken a sweep through this guide to ensure all pricing and availability info is still correct. Our recommendations are unchanged.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-portable-ssd-120043652.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Welcome to Video Games Weekly on Engadget. Expect a new story every Monday or Tuesday, broken into two parts. The first is a space for short essays and ramblings about video game trends and related topics from me, Jess Conditt, a reporter who's covered the industry for more than 13 years. The second contains the video game stories from the past week that you need to know about, including some headlines from outside of Engadget.\nPlease enjoy — and I'll see you next week.\n\nThis week, I’m fried. Maybe it’s the plodding and ever-present crumbling of society and human decency, or maybe it’s because Love Island USA just ended so I’m feeling extra listless. It’s a familiar summer sensation, but this year everything is exaggerated and extra tense, the stakes of every action seem higher, and instead of melting into the warmth of the season with a popsicle and a smile, I often find myself frozen and numb. I am the popsicle, coo coo ca choo.\nI’m not sure exactly what I’m trying to convey here, but I think it’s clear that I shouldn’t be writing anything too serious at the moment. I’m working on a few reports and trying to keep my composure amid the chaos, and all the while, the video game headlines keep rolling on. I’ve included a few more than usual this week, as penance for my popsicle state.\n\nThe news\nThe Chinese Room escapes from Tencent\nUK studio The Chinese Room, creator of Still Wakes the Deep and Everybody’s Gone to the Rapture, is independent once again. The Chinese Room leaders completed a management buyout with help from VC firm Hiro Capital to fully split the studio from Tencent subsidiary Sumo Digital, which acquired it in 2018. A number of people were laid off as part of the transition and the studio is left with a total of 55 employees. The Chinese Room is still working on Vampire: The Masquerade — Bloodlines 2 for Paradox Interactive, and it also has original projects in development.\nStill Wakes the Deep was one of my absolute favorite games of 2024. Whether you’re a fan of beautiful paranormal horror or you're just really into oil rigs, give it a go.\nRead these stories that Vice censored\nVice’s owner, Savage Ventures, doesn’t want you to read this story. Or this one.\nVice removed two articles about Steam’s new ban on certain “adult-only” content and the organization that pushed for the change, Collective Shout, which has the support of prominent anti-pornography groups with conservative religious foundations. The stories were written by contributor Ana Valens, who said the removals were “due to concerns about the controversial subject matter — not journalistic complaints.” Valens has vowed to never write for Vice again and a handful of reporters there have resigned in solidarity.\nCensoring stories about censorship is certainly a choice, Vice.\nSupermassive delays Directive 8020 and shrinks its team\nThe home of Until Dawn and The Dark Pictures Anthology, Supermassive Games, is laying off 36 people, restructuring its team and delaying one of its projects into 2026. A statement from the studio says the decisions were in response to the video game industry’s “challenging and ever-evolving environment.” It’s estimated that Supermassive had more than 300 employees before the layoffs.\nDirective 8020, the fifth installment in the Dark Pictures Anthology, is now due to come out in the first half of 2026, rather than this fall. Honestly, I’m not surprised to hear Supermassive needs more time to work on Directive 8020. I watched Engadget UK bureau chief Mat Smith play the demo at Summer Game Fest in June, and while it looked great, we were both surprised by how short and non-interactive the segment was. He summed up this feeling in his preview with the line, “Finally, I got to play (but only for a few minutes).”\nSupermassive is also working on Little Nightmares III, a series that it took over from Tarsier Studios. Tarsier created Little Nightmares and its sequel, but lost the rights to the IP when the team was acquired by a subsidiary of Embracer Group in 2019. Series publisher Bandai Namco kept the Little Nightmares brand and commissioned Supermassive to build the third game, while Tarsier is working on its own project, Reanimal.\nIt makes sense that Supermassive would prioritize Little Nightmares III in order to fulfill its obligations with Bandai. The game has already been delayed once, and it’s set to hit PC and consoles on October 10.\nFBC: Firebreak is getting less busted\nI still have high hopes for FBC: Firebreak to be the Left 4 Dead revival we’ve always wanted, but fact is, it’s not quite there yet. Remedy Entertainment is aware of this hard truth and has a plan to fix it. The studio laid out its pipeline for making FBC: Firebreak easier to jump into, more fun to play and less confusing overall, with most major changes coming in an update this winter.\nValve is still the best retirement community in game development\nPCGamesN published an interview with Counter-Strike co-creator Minh Le, who left Valve years ago to try out independent development. One sentiment stuck out to me.\n“They didn't force me out or anything,” Le told PCGamesN. “But a part of me kind of regrets it. Looking back, my decision to leave Valve was, financially, kind of a poor decision. If I had stayed with Valve, I would have been able to retire by now.”\nIt’s not presented as an indictment of Valve, but I find it notable that Le describes the studio as a place to retire, rather than a space to innovate and create the next generation of video games. At this rate, Valve will never outrun its reputation as the studio where talented game developers go to die (professionally speaking). \nBut, hey, at least they're not getting laid off en masse. Which, unfortunately, brings us to the next headline.\nYour favorite studio’s favorite studio faces layoffs\nCyberpunk 2077, Sea of Thieves and Dune: Awakening support studio Virtuos is laying off 270 developers, which is about seven percent of its staff. Virtuos is currently best known as the studio behind The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remastered alongside Bethesda, and it has more than 4,000 employees across Asia, Europe and North America. The cuts affect developers in Asia and Europe, with “fewer than 10” in France, where work on Oblivion Remastered was headquartered.\nHeck yeah, there’s gonna be a Hellraiser game\nMake sure to pin this one on your calendar. Saber Interactive is making Clive Barker's Hellraiser: Revival, a first-person, action-survival horror game that features actor Doug Bradley as Pinhead for the first time in nearly 20 years. Barker himself provided input on the story, too. It’s coming to PlayStation 5, PC and Xbox Series X/S, with no release date yet.\n\"The Hellraiser universe is defined by its unflinching exploration of pain, pleasure, and the thin and terrifying line that separates the two,\" a description from Saber Interactive reads. \"That essence is at the heart of our game.\"\n\nAn inside look at the fallout of the Zenimax layoffs\nGame Developer reporter Chris Kerr spoke with a number of employees at Zenimax who are still reeling from the layoffs that Microsoft enacted in early July. The vibes there sound pretty terrible.\n“This carcass of workers that remains is somehow supposed to keep shipping award-winning games,\" one senior QA tester told Kerr. The developer continued, “Microsoft just took everything that could have been great about the culture and collaboration and decimated it. Morale is terrible. It's grotesque. People are stressed. They're crying.”\nXbox cloud play anywhere\nWhen Xbox isn’t firing thousands of employees in one blow, it’s quietly laying the groundwork for the future of video game distribution. An update for Xbox Insiders this week introduces cross-platform cloud support, bringing your cloud library and play history to the Xbox PC app. This means you can access cloud activity on an Xbox console, PC or Windows handheld, and seamlessly play cloud games across devices. This is just how video games are going to work in the coming decades, and it’s interesting to watch our future slowly roll out in blog posts and software updates.\nSubnautica 2 scandal catch-up\nDid you miss all of the mess around Subnautica 2 last week? Or, more accurately, this past month? To quickly summarize, Subnautica publisher Krafton is being sued by the series creators after it fired them and then delayed their game, allegedly sabotaging a $250 million bonus payout due to developers. To not-quickly summarize, see my complete breakdown of the drama.\nMy Melody & Kuromi hits Netflix this week\nI don’t know who else needs a little levity in their life right now, but I certainly do. Thankfully, the stop-motion show My Melody & Kuromi is coming to Netflix on July 24, and there’s already an adorable tie-in music video by LE SSERAFIM to enjoy. Zen out, watch all of the Sanrio sweetness and finally settle the debate: Are you more of a Kuromi or a My Melody?\n\nAdditional reading\n\nKris Holt's weekly indie game roundup\n\n\nHave a tip for Jessica? You can reach her by email, Bluesky or send a message to @jesscon.96 to chat confidentially on Signal.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/video-games-weekly-censorship-shrinkage-and-a-subnautica-scandal-221839722.html?src=rss",

It makes sense that Supermassive would prioritize Little Nightmares III in order to fulfill its obligations with Bandai. Remedy Entertainment is aware of this hard truth and has a plan to fix it.

The company quietly ended the Threads bonus program, which offered some creators thousands of dollars a month in bonuses, earlier this year, Engadget has confirmed.\nThe company hasn't officially commented on why it stopped the payments, but an Instagram support page that once listed details about the creator incentives no longer references Threads at all. In posts on Threads, creators who were once part of the program have said they stopped receiving payments around the end of April. That's roughly one year after Meta first started paying creators for popular posts.

The company is still trying to lure more brands and notable faces to the platform, and has tested features to help people find popular creators they previously followed on X. Meta has also added creator-friendly tools, like the ability to add more links to profiles and more detailed analytics for the app.\nBut Meta has yet to clearly explain what it can offer creators in return. The platform is hardly driving any traffic to outside websites. It's also much harder to build a following on Threads, since the platform defaults to an algorithmic timeline consisting mainly of recommended content.

    "summary": "Gamers aren't usually known for their sartorial elegance. But that doesn't mean we don't deserve nice things. So after checking out a very utilitarian carrying case for the Switch 2, I wanted to explore the other side of things with a more lavish travel bag. And while Waterfield's Magnetic case for Nintendo's latest console certainly isn't the most rugged or affordable way to lug a handheld console around, it might just be the most luxurious.\nDesign: Drape me in this leather\nCompared to most Switch 2 travel bags that are made out of materials like plastic and polyester, Waterfield's case is an exercise in opulence. It's crafted from buttery full-grain leather that's softer than than a perfectly worn in baseball mitt or fancy Dior gloves. It really is that nice. \n \nI've been using the white leather model as I love how clean and simple it looks while still giving you that irresistible pillowy exterior. But for the kind of folk who get excited about patina, the chocolate model features a more distressed look that isn't afraid to show off oil, scuffs and blemishes. And if the need arises, you can always hit the case with hot air from a hair dryer to reduce the appearance of scratches.\nBut the thing that sets Waterfield's case apart from its competition is that instead of relying on a zipper, the pouch has a series of magnets to keep everything together. And honestly, there's just something really nice about not having any sharp objects near or around the case, so there's no fear of your Switch 2 getting nicked. This enclosure system also makes it super simple to thread a cable inside, allowing you to charge Nintendo's latest handheld without it needing to leave the safety of its case. On a practical level, I've also found that because taking the console in and out is so quick and easy, I'm much better about putting things back when I'm done gaming.\nThe obvious downside to this is that it's easier for stuff like sand to get inside and if you're storing tiny accessories like a microSD Express card, there's no real guarantee it won't fall out while you're in transit. Additionally, the trade-off for the case's fancy leather exterior is that it doesn't have the hard, rigid panels used in a lot of competitors, so it's not the most rugged travel companion. If you press down on the outside of the case, you can feel things like console's buttons and joysticks, so this definitely isn't something you'll want to cram into an already stuffed piece of luggage.\nOn the inside, Waterfield's case is lined with a plush microfiber fabric that will keep the Switch 2 nice and cozy. There are also two pockets for stashing small items like charging cables, game cartridges or Joy-Con straps. But I do mean small, because anything larger will cause the case to bulge, which may put undue stress on the console.\nOptional accessories\n\n\n\n\n   Sam Rutherford for Engadget \n \n\nThis case doesn't come with much in the way of bundled extras. Though like a lot of luxury products (just look at the options list on a Porsche or Ferrari), you can purchase additional accessories such as cord clips, AirTag holders and more. But the most important of these are Waterfield's game card holders, which are available in several sizes (4, 10 and 20). So I went and bought a 10-slot sleeve and it really is the perfect complement to the case. Cartridges fit snug and the holder itself nestles neatly into the pouch's built-in pockets. I just wish one came included, as you're looking at an extra $10 to $30 on top of an already pricey travel protector.\nWrap-up\nStarting at $90 for the nylon or waxed canvas models or $120 for the leather versions, Waterfield's Magnetic Case for the Switch 2 certainly ain't cheap. That's more expensive than Belkin's Charging Case, which comes with its own battery pack. And that's before you factor in a game card holder.\n\n\n\n\n   Sam Rutherford for Engadget \n \n\nBut the sheer suppleness of its leather and its super soft interior might be the comfiest cocoon Nintendo's handheld will ever experience. Then you add in a magnetic enclosure system and it feels like Waterfield has managed to transform a product that might normally be an afterthought into something that's a joy to use all by itself. So for those who want a travel pouch that looks and feels just as good as the console it's protecting (if not better), this case is in a class of its own.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/waterfield-magnetic-case-review-the-most-lavish-way-to-carry-your-switch-2-around-200052731.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Lucid EV owners will soon have full access to Tesla’s Supercharger network, which is something that's been in the works since 2023. This goes live on July 31, allowing folks to juice up at more than 12,000 Supercharger stations throughout North America. Some of the company's vehicles can already use these charging stations, with the Gravity SUV gaining access earlier this year.\nThat leaves the Air line of luxury EV sedans. These vehicles will be able to roll up to a Tesla Supercharger for a top-off at the end of the month, but there are some major caveats. First of all, Lucid Air EVs will require an official adapter that costs $220, as they don't ship with a built-in NACS ports. This adapter won't work with V1 or V2 charging stations, which whittles down the convenience factor a bit.\nThere's another problem for Air owners. The adapter is limited to a 50kW peak charge rate, which provides around 200 miles of range per hour of charging. The Air can typically achieve a 300kW peak charge rate. Not only is this hobbled charge rate bad for Lucid Air devotees, it's also annoying for people that own other EVs. Remember, the Air will have to sit at the charger for an entire hour, which will increase traffic at the station.\nLuckily, there are other charging stations available that make use of that 300kW peak rate. Air owners can use stations by Electrify America, EVgo and ChargePoint for a quick jolt. It's good to know that the Tesla Superchargers will be there in a pinch, which could come in handy during a road trip.\n\n\nThe company also recently unveiled the 2026 lineup of Air EVs.

    "full_text": "Lucid EV owners will soon have full access to Tesla’s Supercharger network, which is something that's been in the works since 2023. This goes live on July 31, allowing folks to juice up at more than 12,000 Supercharger stations throughout North America. These vehicles will be able to roll up to a Tesla Supercharger for a top-off at the end of the month, but there are some major caveats. First of all, Lucid Air EVs will require an official adapter that costs $220, as they don't ship with a built-in NACS ports. This adapter won't work with V1 or V2 charging stations, which whittles down the convenience factor a bit. The Air can typically achieve a 300kW peak charge rate. Air owners can use stations by Electrify America, EVgo and ChargePoint for a quick jolt. There's the Lucid Air Pure, which is a relatively streamlined option.

    "summary": "The Chinese Room, maker of Still Wakes the Deep, has bought back its independence. The studio will continue developing new franchises after splitting from the Sumo Group. The latter said earlier this year that it's pivoting away from original games and toward co-development work. Tencent bought the British studio Sumo for $1.27 billion in 2021.\nGame Developer reported that VC firm Hiro Capital facilitated the Chinese Room's independence deal. Studio head Ed Daly told the publication on Monday that the company is open to partnering with other developers moving forward.\nUnfortunately, the studio's good news is tainted with an all-too-familiar story. The studio confirmed to Game Developer that it will lay off an undisclosed number of employees as part of the split. \"Following the divestment process, a number of roles were regrettably made redundant,\" a company spokesperson said. \"The specifics are confidential, but the studio is currently 55 developers. This was a very difficult process as we sought a future for the studio outside of Sumo. No more layoffs are planned as the studio moves forward.\"\nThe Chinese Room / Secret Mode\nThe \"modern horror classic\" Still Wakes the Deep isn't all the studio is known for. The Chinese Room also made Little Orpheus, Everybody's Gone to the Rapture and the OG walking simulator, Dear Esther. The UK-based developer is also working on Vampire: The Masquerade — Bloodlines 2 with Paradox Interactive. The long-delayed title is scheduled to launch in October. The Chinese Room is also developing two other unannounced titles.\n\"This management buyout allows us to scratch the creative itch of continuing to work on new, original intellectual property but also to partner with other studios on other projects when they fit in with our vision,\" Daly told Game Developer. \"This is what we are doing and we want to carry on doing it, so we're happy to carry on in this vein.\"This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/still-wakes-the-deep-developer-the-chinese-room-regains-its-independence-182405167.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Since last June, when DuckDuckGo introduced AI Chat, you've been able to use chat bots like Claude directly through the browser. Now the company is making it easier to tweak the system prompts of those AI models while retaining your privacy. For the uninitiated, system prompts are a set of instructions given to a chat bot at the start of a conversation to guide things along. Often they'll set the tone of the dialogue, and can sometimes cause a chat bot to be overly sycophantic as was the case with GPT-4o this past March. \nBoth Anthropic and OpenAI give users a way to customize the responses of their respective chat bots, but if you don't know where to look for those settings, they can be tricky to find. DuckDuckGo's new system setting is available directly through Duck.ai's prompt bar and works a bit differently. Whatever customization you add is appended to the default system prompt for each model you chat with, meaning you don't need to set them independently of one another.

    "full_text": "Since last June, when DuckDuckGo introduced AI Chat, you've been able to use chat bots like Claude directly through the browser. Now the company is making it easier to tweak the system prompts of those AI models while retaining your privacy. For the uninitiated, system prompts are a set of instructions given to a chat bot at the start of a conversation to guide things along. Often they'll set the tone of the dialogue, and can sometimes cause a chat bot to be overly sycophantic as was the case with GPT-4o this past March. Both Anthropic and OpenAI give users a way to customize the responses of their respective chat bots, but if you don't know where to look for those settings, they can be tricky to find. DuckDuckGo's new system setting is available directly through Duck.ai's prompt bar and works a bit differently. Whatever customization you add is appended to the default system prompt for each model you chat with, meaning you don't need to set them independently of one another. Moreover, your tweaks are stored locally on your device, with no data being sent to Anthropic, OpenAI or any other model provider. It's a small addition, but if you use Duck.ai to compare the responses between different models, now you'll get more consistency in tone."

    "summary": "CMF, the budget-friendly sub-brand from Nothing, has announced its latest smartwatch. Billed by its maker as the ideal entry-level fitness watch, the $99 Watch 3 Pro is the most advanced CMF wearable to date, promising updated health tracking and various built-in AI coaching features.\nThe Watch 3 Pro introduces dual-band GPS, which should make its route tracking more accurate, as well as a new four-channel heart rate sensor that Nothing says offers \"improved accuracy across all skin tones and workout intensities.\" You can choose from 131 sports modes, which is 11 more than its predecessor, with a personalized AI coach providing post-workout summaries and guidance. This includes long-distance running endurance predictions to help you train for that looming 10K.\nIn addition to the updated heart rate and sleep tracking, the Watch 3 Pro is also capable of blood oxygen (SpO₂) monitoring, stress tracking, guided breathing exercises, hydration and inactivity reminders, as well as women’s health tracking.\nOn-wrist ChatGPT integration allows you to ask questions and set reminders using \"natural language\" voice prompts, and there’s a voice recorder with autotranscription for when you want to quickly log a mid-run thought. You can also use AI to generate custom watch faces using the Watch Face Studio, in which you’ll find more than 120 styles premade out of the box. Widgets can be applied for fitness, weather, music or reminders, with a full-screen option available.\nCMF’s latest wearable has a 1.43-inch AMOLED, always-on display, and you’re getting a 10 percent increase in screen-to-body ratio compared to the Watch Pro 2 before it. Battery life is 13 days with \"typical\" use, which Nothing says is a two-day improvement over its predecessor. If you're hitting the tracking hard you can expect around 11 days of juice on a full charge. With the always-on display enabled, battery life unsurprisingly takes a significant hit to around 4.5 days.\nNothing says the Watch 3 Pro and all other smartwatches in the CMF lineup now use the Nothing X app, with the new control centre promising improved stability and a more intuitive UI. It also plays nice with Strava, Apple Health, and Google Health Connect\nYou’re getting a fair bit of bang for your buck, then, but we’ll have to wait and see how the Watch 3 Pro fares against pricier alternatives where everyday performance is concerned. When TechRadar reviewed the Watch 2 Pro earlier this year, it had lots of positive impressions of the watch, but noted some spotty fitness tracking and sensor detection. 9to5Google was even more critical, finding fault with the heart rate tracking and concluding that the product felt unfinished. And while the Watch 3 Pro covers a lot of the bases for fitness watches with its various sensors, it still lacks NFC for payments, which could be a deal-breaker for some people.\nAvailable in Dark Grey, Light Grey, and Orange colorways, the CMF Watch 3 Pro costs $99 (a not insignificant $30 bump on the Watch Pro 2) is available to buy now.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wearables/nothings-99-cmf-watch-3-pro-offers-better-battery-life-and-ai-fitness-coaching-151058055.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "OpenAI has struck a deal with Oracle to add an astounding 4.5 gigawatts of US data center capacity to power the massive workload required by its large language models. The companies haven't specified where these new centers will be built, but Bloomberg is reporting that Texas, Michigan, Wisconsin and Wyoming are all under consideration.\nThe ChatGPT maker says this new capacity is a part of the Stargate Project, and that together with its one GW campus in Abilene, Texas, the company is projecting more than five GW of total capacity running over two million AI chips once the new centers are complete. Oracle began delivering its GB200 racks last month for the Abilene site as it begins operations. OpenAI estimates that the massive undertaking will create over 100,000 jobs, though data centers historically employ few full-time workers, with most of the jobs tied to construction.\nWhile details on budget were not shared, OpenAI says that these new data centers represent significant progress toward its promise of investing $500 billion in the United States to build out 10 GW of AI infrastructure over the next four years. These investments, which are all part of The Stargate Project, are being made alongside SoftBank and Oracle as partners, though SoftBank is not financing this phase.\nThis announcement comes as big tech companies are pouring billions into new data centers and power agreements to sustain the growth of AI and power future models. Google recently closed a £3 billion deal to secure 3,000 megawatts of hydroelectric power, while Microsoft is planning to restart the nuclear power plants of Three Mile Island.\nIn a press release announcing the new project, Open AI said \" Stargate is an ambitious undertaking designed to meet the historic opportunity in front of us.
