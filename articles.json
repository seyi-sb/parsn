    "full_text": "Skygazers rejoice, the summer isn't finished with delivering dazzling meteor showers. The Perseids meteor shower is about to give you a real light show, provided you're far enough away from light pollution to see it. The show started on July 17, and will run through Aug. 23. During its peak, the meteor shower is known to rain down as many as 100 meteors per hour, according to the American Meteor Society. Per NASA, fireballs tend to last longer than standard shooting stars and can come in a variety of different colors. Until then, it leaves behind an excellent tail of dust and debris to feed us yearly meteor showers. During this time, the shower will produce anywhere from 25 to 100 meteors per hour on average. Thus, if you're planning on watching this year's Perseids during their peak, you'll want to get out of the city and suburbs as far as possible. Like all meteors, Perseids are named after the constellation from which they appear. Thus, it is highly probable that light pollution from the moon may reduce the number of visible meteors by a hefty margin, depending on how things go."

    "full_text": "He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme. During its big GPT-5 livestream on Thursday, OpenAI showed off a few charts that made the model seem quite impressive — but if you look closely, some graphs were a little bit off. In one, ironically showing how well GPT-5 does in “deception evals across models,” the scale is all over the place. For “coding deception,” for example, the chart shown onstage says GPT-5 with thinking apparently gets a 50.0 percent deception rate, but that’s compared to OpenAI’s smaller 47.4 percent o3 score which somehow has a larger bar. OpenAI appears to have accurate numbers for this chart in its GPT-5 blog post, however, where GPT-5’s deception rate is labeled as 16.5 percent. With this chart, OpenAI showed onstage that one of GPT-5’s scores is lower than o3’s but is shown with a bigger bar. In this same chart, o3 and GPT-4o’s scores are different but shown with equally-sized bars. It was bad enough that CEO Sam Altman commented on it, calling it a “mega chart screwup,” though he noted that a correct version is in OpenAI’s blog post. OpenAI didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. And while it’s unclear if OpenAI used GPT-5 to actually make the charts, it’s still not a great look for the company on its big launch day — especially when it is touting the “significant advances in reducing hallucinations” with its new model."

Those states can be broken up into three categories. The very northern reaches of Indiana and Ohio may see something, but it's not likely. This week's aurora comes to Earth courtesy of an M-class solar flare that the sun ejected on Aug. 5. It was one of several solar flares observed in what has been a very active week for the sun, but this particular M-class flare was pointed right at Earth when it erupted. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicts a fairly active aurora on Aug. 7 and Aug. 8. NOAA also recommends viewing between 10 p.m. and 2 a.m. local time as that is generally when activity is at its zenith. Finally, if you can swing it, you'll want to get to an elevated position and look north for the best results. Since we are within a few days of a full moon, the moon's brightness may impact your ability to see things if you're at the southern reaches of this aurora."

It's a wide variety of games made by different independent developers. Some games are intended to be played solo, while others are meant to be played with others. The selection does feel random, but they're connected by the story of a fictional game studio, UFOSoft, that created these 50 games that it never released. Along with UFO 50, more than a dozen indie games were revealed during the showcase, including: Some games are set to come out in the coming weeks, while others will arrive in 2026. Those who want a physical copy of the game can preorder one from Fangamer for $35."

Samsung advertises that the Z Fold 7 can withstand 500,000 folds. Samsung didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. \"One thing I learned from this project is that there can be a clear difference between lab test results and results from real-world scenarios,\" said ITchelin. \"I also realized that in any durability test, it's important to assess not only the hardware but also how the internal software behaves over time.\" Given that foldable phones have complex hinge designs and flexible displays, they are more prone to damage or failure than regular slab-style phones."

Laptops are great, but sometimes it’s simply just more convenient to use a tablet like the iPad Air. And right now, the latest version of the Air is down to a new low price. The M3-powered 11-inch iPad Air with 128GB tablet is available for $449 ($150 off) at Amazon, Best Buy, Target, and Walmart. The 13-inch 128GB model is on sale as well, starting at $649 ($150 off) at Amazon, Best Buy, and Target. It’ll support windowed multitasking when iPadOS 26 becomes available this fall. (My colleague Todd Haselton has called windowed multitasking the iPad’s “best new feature in 15 years.”) Powered by the M3 chip, the Air is more powerful than the entry-level iPad and works with both the Apple Pencil USB-C and the Apple Pencil Pro, the latter of which has features like Find My support and squeeze gestures for quickly switching tools. Plus, the Air comes with support for Apple Intelligence, so you can take advantage of extra perks like generative AI-powered writing and image editing tools. The top-of-the-line M4-powered iPad Pro is still the most powerful iPad, capable of handling demanding games and advanced creative apps. But if you’re looking for a fast tablet for everyday work and play, the iPad Air strikes the perfect balance especially now it’s cheaper than ever."

It was trained to distinguish between safe messages and those that were previously reported because they violated Roblox's child-endangerment policy.

If you decide to turn on your location on Instagram Map, your location only updates when you open the app or have it running in the background, meaning it doesn’t provide continuous, real-time location updates. This is different from Snap Map, which lets users choose whether their location is updated only when they open the app or in real time. Meta says location sharing is off by default on Instagram Map. Following concerns around safety, Instagram head Adam Mosseri reassured users that the feature is opt-in, and noted that some people are “confused” about how the feature works. It’s worth noting that this isn’t new, as Instagram already had location tags visible to users in its map view. However, the new Instagram Map feature makes this information a lot easier to access. For those who want to ensure their location is turned off on Instagram Map, we’ll walk you through the steps below. If it’s your first time accessing the feature, you’ll likely see a pop-up message notifying you about the new Map. Here, you will be able to change your settings."

    "full_text": "During today’s Nintendo Indie World showcase, I had two epiphanies. My friends love “friendslop,” the initially derisive but now descriptive nickname given to indie co-op games with a loose gameplay structure that permits the kind of chaos that can make games go viral on social media. Friendslop is known for low-quality graphics (hence the “slop” part) that give a game a stylized look that’s common among other indie games. The term hasn’t become a ubiquitous genre descriptor like metroidvania or soulslike, but it’s still useful for labeling the kinds of casual co-op games that have recently exploded in popularity, primarily on Steam. If a game cannot be played from my couch, I don’t want it. GameChat sands down those spiky bits of friction, allowing you to connect with friends at the press of a button to play online together like in Mario Kart World, or play together separately, each person in the little four-player lobby chatting away while doing their own thing. The Switch 2 GameChat feature eliminates my barrier to entry in these kinds of games. With one button on one device, I can connect with my friends and yap to my heart’s content as we’re all eaten alive by underwater cryptids. Content Warning, for example, is a game where you and your friends explore an underwater ruin in hopes of filming supernatural phenomena to farm clout and ad revenue on social media. And they’re focused on partying with your friends, a key feature in some of the most popular games out there right now."

    "full_text": "It’s official: Skydance Media’s deal to purchase CBS parent company Paramount Global for $8 billion is complete, and incoming chairman / CEO David Ellison’s first order of business is a massive restructuring. “In doing so, we will be able to reduce our technology spend while driving substantial efficiency and performance gains and enabling leaders across the company to make faster and better decisions,” Ellison said. Ellison listed AI-assisted translation, virtual sound stages, and proprietary ad-tech stacks as some of the things he wants to see more widely implemented. “This integration will elevate the consumer experience across our services—enhancing our recommendation engine, accelerating delivery speed and quality, while also giving us the opportunity to position Pluto TV as the ‘top of the funnel’ to attract new customers to Paramount Plus,” Ellison said. The new company’s launch comes just weeks after the FCC’s approval of the merger, which hinged on Skydance and Paramount’s willingness to capitulate to the Trump administration’s push to eliminate diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs in corporate America. FCC Chairman Brendan Carr said at the time that Skydance had “made written commitments to ensure that the new company’s programming embodies a diversity of viewpoints from across the political and ideological spectrum.” Skydance also agreed to “adopt measures that can root out the bias that has undermined trust in the national news media,” which is why there will now be an ombudsman tasked with bringing complaints about “bias or other concerns” to the president of CBS News. It was clear that the FCC would not sign off on the Paramount / Skydance merger until Paramount agreed to pay $16 million to settle Donald Trump’s lawsuit against the company over claims that CBS News edited a 60 Minutes interview with Kamala Harris in a way that misled voters during the 2024 elections. Trump’s lawsuit was “so ill grounded that it comes close to being sanctionable as frivolous,” according to one legal expert, but had Paramount stood its ground, it could have jeopardized Skydance’s chances of securing a deal. There’s also widespread belief that Paramount’s payout to Trump contributed to the “financial” reasoning behind CBS’ decision to cancel The Late Show With Stephen Colbert last month. But now that all the dust has settled, we can all step back and plainly see what these deals were for: to get some shareholders paid."

    "summary": "Last month, a Pew Research Center report shed light on Google's AI Overviews' effect on web publishing. In short, the analysis painted an abysmal outlook for anyone relying on web traffic. But on Wednesday, Google Search head Liz Reid penned a blog post that puts quite a different spin on things. The Google VP claims traffic from search to websites is \"relatively stable\" and that click quality has increased.\nReid's framing boils down to everything is peachy, and AI is making things better — even for websites! She wrote that Google Search's total organic click volume to websites has been \"relatively\" stable year-over-year. Reid also claimed Google sends more \"quality clicks\" (visitors who don't quickly bounce) to websites than a year ago. The company says people are also happier with the search experience.\nThe company didn't share any numbers — the post has no data whatsoever — to support its claims.\nGoogle's explanation for the rosy outlook? \"With AI Overviews, people are searching more and asking new questions that are often longer and more complex,\" Reid wrote. \"In addition, with AI Overviews, people are seeing more links on the page than before. More queries and more links mean more opportunities for websites to surface and get clicked.\"\nReid does highlight a shifting landscape. She says user trends are resulting in lower traffic for some sites and increased traffic for others. Of course, the Google Search head didn't call out any specific websites. But she claims forums, videos, podcasts and posts with \"authentic voices and first-hand perspectives\" are thriving. Reid added that content like \"an in-depth review, an original post, a unique perspective, or a thoughtful first-person analysis\" does well.\nGoogle / Engadget\nThe Google VP said people seeking simple Q&A types of searches are leaning more on AI. \"For some questions where people are looking for a quick answer, like 'when is the next full moon,' people may be satisfied with the initial AI Overviews response and not click further,\" Reid wrote. \"This has also been true for other answer features we've added, like the Knowledge Graph or sports scores. But for many other types of questions, people continue to click through, as they want to dig deeper into a topic, explore further or make a purchase. This is why we see click quality increasing — an AI response might provide the lay of the land, but people click to dive deeper and learn more, and when they do, these clicks are more valuable.\"\nIt's quite the contrast from the Pew report. It found that visitors who saw an AI summary clicked a traditional search result in eight percent of all visits. Those without an AI summary? They clicked on a traditional result in 15 percent of their visits. As for actually clicking the source links in AI summaries? Pew's study found that one percent of Google searches that included AI summaries resulted in a user clicking on those source links. Users were also more likely to end their browsing after visiting a page with an AI summary.\nThat aligned with comments Cloudflare CEO Matthew Prince made in June. He said search traffic referrals keep plummeting. \"The future of the web is going to be more and more like AI, and that means that people are going to be reading the summaries of your content, not the original content,\" he said. Prince said that a decade ago, Google sent a publisher one visitor for every two pages it crawled. Early this year, it dropped to one visitor for every six pages. He said that, in June, it was down to one for every 18.\nI can't tell you who to believe. But here's what the ultimate source had to say:\nGoogle / Engadget\nCorrection, August 7, 2025, 2:55PM ET: This article has been updated to note that Pew's study found one percent of Google searches with AI summaries had someone click on a source link in those summaries. It previously stated that one percent of search users clicked on those source links. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/google-actually-ai-in-search-is-driving-more-queries-and-higher-quality-clicks-204946965.html?src=rss",

    "full_text": "That means it can now directly issue credit and debit cards and offer its spend management products to any business in all 30 EU countries with “no workarounds required,” as co-founder and CEO Pedro Franceschi wrote in a blog post. While the corporate spend management startup previously supported 60 currencies in 200 countries, it could only sell its products to companies with a U.S. presence. With the expansion, Brex is now authorized to sell spend management (complete with issuing cards) and other tools like embedded payments to EU companies and startups, a spokesperson tells TechCrunch. However, there’s a caveat: Banking and bill pay will not be initially available. Brex’s claim to fame is offering startups expense management cards for their employees even if they wouldn’t yet qualify from traditional banks. Without a bank account offering, the youngest EU startups will still have to weigh their options. That’s quite the turnaround from a shaky moment in 2023 when Brex conducted layoffs and reportedly told employees that its cash burn was too high. There has been no hint yet as to when that IPO may take place, though. Brex’s competitive win in the international market comes as its U.S. fintech competitors are having an overall moment. Brex has not publicly announced new equity VC funding since 2022, when it raised $300 million in a Series D-2 round at a $12.3 billion valuation."

    "summary": "Yesterday, Meta introduced a new map feature that's almost identical to Snapchat's Snap Map. The feature has quickly sparked a backlash, though, and not just because it's yet another example of Instagram ripping off a Snapchat feature.\nWhile the map requires users to opt-in to share their location, many users were surprised and alarmed to see that their Instagram map was already populated with the locations of some accounts when it launched. That's because the map automatically pulls in location info when someone has recently shared a Story or Reel with a location tagged.\nFor example, I posted a Story that tagged San Francisco's botanical gardens and it tagged me there on Instagram's map even though I have my map location set to share with \"no one.\" This isn't that different from how Instagram has worked in the past: location tags have always been visible to your followers, and the app has always had a map view that let people see public posts that have been tagged with specific places.\nMy story post tagged me on Instagram's map even though location is set to \"no one\" because I tagged a location (in this case San Francisco's botanical gardens).Instagram screenshot\nBut Instagram's map makes this information much more prominent and easy to access. While before you would have to tap into specific posts to see location tags, the new map puts all of this into a single view. Depending on how often you tag locations, this can make it seem like your real-time info is being shared, even when it isn't.\nAll that, combined with Meta's messy history with user privacy, has understandably ignited new concerns from people worried about their location being accidentally exposed by Instagram. Some users have questioned  why the map exists at all given the potentially serious implications of unknowingly sharing your location with all of your Instagram mutuals.\nIt's also led to a lot of misunderstanding. A number of prominent accounts on Threads have suggested that location sharing is on by default. At the time of this writing, \"Instagram map\" is the top trend on Threads, with more than 850,000 posts — most of which are privacy related. Instagram head Adam Mosseri has replied to more than a dozen accounts attempting to explain how it actually works.\nScreenshot / Threads\n\"We're double checking everything, but so far it looks mostly like people are confused and assume that, because they can see themselves on the map when they open, other people can see them too,\" Mosseri wrote in response to a Threads user who asked why people were reporting seeing themselves on the map without opting in. \"We're still checking everything though to make sure nobody shares location without explicitly deciding to do so, which, by the way, requires a double consent by design (we ask you to confirm after you say you want to share).\"\nHow to check your Instagram Map settings\nYou can find the Instagram map by swiping over to your inbox and selecting the \"map\" icon at the top. The settings menu in the top right corner allows you to confirm who you want to be able to find you on the map: you can choose between \"friends\" (mutuals), \"close friends\" or a list of specific accounts. The default setting is \"no one,\" and the app also shows a red location arrow when \"no one is selected.\"\nInstagram screenhsot\nIt's also worth checking whether you've tagged a location on any posts within the last 24 hours. If you have, then you'll be tagged at that place on the map even if you've set your sharing settings to \"no one.\" Location tags only appear on the Instagram map for 24 hours, according to Meta, so it won't keep a running log of everywhere you've been, and it won't show your live location. Still, these tags could reveal more about your whereabouts than you intended. If you have tagged a place, you can either delete the post entirely or edit it to remove the tag, which should keep it from showing up on the map.\nWhen you do opt to share your location on the map, the friends you select will be able to see where you're at in real time. You can still set some limitations, though.\nThe map also has a \"hidden places\" feature that allows you to always hide specific locations that may be sensitive, like your home. The feature itself is, ironically, somewhat hidden. You can find it by tapping the \"...\" menu on the map's location settings and choosing \"hide places.\" The app will then let you drag a pin on the map and choose a surrounding radius to hide. The feature works well if you want to hide the place you're currently at, but it's a bit clunky if you want to block off multiple locations because you can't enter specific addresses.\nInstagram screenshot\nRegardless, if you're worried about exposing your whereabouts, the safest option is to keep location sharing set to \"no one\" and to not use location tags in any of your content. It's unclear if Meta plans to change anything about how the Instagram Map works in response to user concerns.\n“Instagram Map is off by default, and your live location is never shared unless you choose to turn it on,\" a Meta spokesperson said in a statement. \"If you do, only people you follow back—or a private, custom list you select—can see your location.”This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/adam-mosseri-says-people-are-confused-about-how-the-instagram-map-works-184736070.html?src=rss",

The three-layer stacked image sensors enable fast shooting speeds and high-frame-rate 8K video in smartphones. The statement was part of Apple's overall announcement that it was launching the American Manufacturing Program, part of a $600 billion investment to increase its supply chain and manufacturing in the US. More US-based manufacturing of iPhone parts could mean \"significantly higher\" prices for iPhones, depending on how many parts are made in the US, said Andrew Chang, director of corporate ratings at S&P Global. \"However, subsidies or better financing terms by wireless carriers could lessen the impact to the consumer,\" Chang said. Thursday's report by the Financial Times clarifies what Apple's \"innovative new technology\" will mean for the iPhone 18. Apple's move will allow it to avoid penalties from President Trump, who on Wednesday announced 100% tariffs on computer chips but added, \"If you're building in the United States of America, there's no charge.\" Amid Trump's push for more US-based manufacturing of tech products, he has had to backtrack on claims that his new T1 phone would be \"designed and built in the United States.\" Chang said it's unlikely that all iPhone parts will be made in the US. Last month, CNET reported that Samsung Display Company -- a separate entity from Samsung -- would be producing the screens for the first iPhone foldable, reportedly to be launched next summer."

    "full_text": "He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme. Meta’s consumer VR headsets are already among the best you can get for their price points, but at a conference next week, the company is showing off some impressive-sounding research prototypes that could be a peek at what its headsets might be capable of in the future. Tiramisu has “high contrast — roughly 3x that of Meta Quest 3 — combined with an angular resolution of 90 pixels per degree (PPD) — 3.6x that of Quest 3 — and brightness up to 1,400 nits — 14x that of Quest 3.” There are apparently some trade-offs, including that it’s “bulkier and heavier” than consumer headsets available today and has a limited field of view (FOV), but it’s “the closest we’ve come to a visual experience that passes the visual Turing test yet.” Meta’s “Tiramisu” research prototype headset. Two other headsets, the “Boba 3” and the “Boba 3 VR,” instead have a very wide FOV. While the Quest 3 has a horizontal FOV of 110 degrees and a vertical FOV of 96 degrees, the Boba 3 headsets have a horizontal FOV of 180 degrees and vertical FOV of 120 degrees. The Boba 3 headsets, which leverage “displays in mass production and similar lens technologies to those found in Quest 3,” have a display resolution per eye of 4K by 4K. That’s higher than the 3K by 3K display resolution per eye of last year’s Boba 2 prototype and the 2K by 1K display resolution per eye of the previous Boba 1 prototype. The prototype headsets will be shown at next week’s SIGGRAPH 2025 conference, and I recommend checking out Meta’s blog post to see videos of them in action. While Meta says they are “purely research prototypes, with novel technologies that may never make their way into a consumer product,” you can see how they might eventually lead to headsets that can offer much more immersive VR experiences."

    "summary": "A couple of days after announcing its first open-weight models in six years, OpenAI is releasing the long-awaited GPT-5. What's more, you can start using it today, even if you're a free user. With GPT-5, the company is touting across-the-board enhancements, claiming the model is its best yet when it comes to coding, writing, safety, accuracy and more.\n\"GPT-5 is the first time that it really feels like you're talking to an expert in any topic,\" said OpenAI CEO (and hypeman) Sam Altman during a press briefing the company held before today's announcement. \"It reminds me of when the iPhone went from those giant, old pixel [screens] to the Retina Display, and then I went back to using one of those big pixelated things and I was like, 'Wow, I can't believe how bad we had it.'\"\nAt the start of the year, Altman said GPT-5 would offer a unified experience for users, and the new model delivers on that promise. For the first time, OpenAI's default offering is a reasoning model, meaning the system is programmed to tackle complex problems by breaking them into smaller parts. Previously, if you wanted to force ChatGPT to use one of OpenAI's reasoning models, you had to select the \"Think Longer\" option from the prompt bar. This meant most free users didn't even know OpenAI had more capable models. With GPT-5, the company has significantly simplified the ChatGPT experience.\nOn the consumer side of things, there are only three versions of the new model. One of those — GPT-5 mini — only crops up when free and Plus users run into their regular GPT-5 usage limit. The other variant, GPT-5 Pro, is, as the name suggests, only available to subscribers of the company's $200 per month Pro plan. On the subject of query limits, Plus users can use GPT-5 \"significantly\" more than those with a free account, while Pro customers can chat with GPT-5 as much as they want.\nOpenAI\nWhen it comes to reasoning, GPT-5 is much faster than o3, OpenAI's previous state-of-the-art AI. \"It's so fast that I've had the psychological experience of wondering, like, is it really thinking enough? And then it gives a great answer,\" said Altman. Perhaps more importantly, it suffers from fewer hallucinations, with OpenAI claiming the model delivers more accurate answers than any of its previous reasoning systems. For instance, when thinking, GPT-5 is approximately 80 percent less likely to include a factual error in its answer than o3. We'll see how GPT-5 responds in real-world use, but if OpenAI has made meaningful improvements here, it would be a big deal; hallucinations have typically been a major weakness of reasoning models, particularly relative to traditional large language counterparts.\nAt the same time, OpenAI says GPT-5 is its safest AI to date. For one, it includes a new feature called Safe Completions. \"In the past, we've approached this from a sort of a binary, if we thought that the prompt was safe, we would comply. If we thought it was unsafe, the model would refuse,\" said Alex Beutel, safety research lead at OpenAI. \"This worked well, but as a challenge that there can be kind of carefully worded prompts that could be confusing. So if someone says how much energy is needed to ignite some specific material that could be an adversary trying to get around the safety protections and cause harm, or it could be a student asking a science question to understand the physics of this material.\"\nWith Safe Completions, GPT-5 will try to give the most helpful answer within the safety constraints OpenAI has imposed on it. In tricky situations like the one Beutel outlined above, the model will only provide high-level information that can't be used to harm anyone. \"On average, the system is both safer and more helpful for users, and we think that'll be much better,\" Beutel added.\nAdditionally, when it comes to health-related questions, GPT-5 is better at flagging concerns and suggesting questions the user should ask of their healthcare provider. It will also answer those prompts more precisely, thanks to the ability to adapt to the person's knowledge level and geography.\nOn top of everything else, OpenAI says GPT-5 is its best model for coding yet. It's supposedly a better writer too, with the company promising the chatbot is better at translating your drafts into \"compelling, resonant\" copy.\nAlongside GPT-5, OpenAI is adding a handful of new features to ChatGPT. To start, users can now choose a color for their chats, with a few exclusive options available for paying customers. OpenAI has also made it easier to connect ChatGPT to Gmail, Google Calendar and Google Contacts. Once you enable the connections, the chatbot will know when to automatically reference your Google accounts; you won't need to select anything before you start chatting. OpenAI will begin rolling out this feature to Pro subscribers starting next week, with availability for other users to follow.\nOver in the Custom Instructions pane, where you can write system prompts to tweak how ChatGPT interacts with you, OpenAI is introducing a handful of pre-set personalities. The four options — cynic, robot, listener and nerd — are available as part of a research preview, and can be changed or disabled at any time.\nLast but not least, OpenAI is releasing an updated version of its Advanced Voice feature the company introduced last summer. OpenAI says the tool is better at understanding instructions and adapting its speaking style to the moment. As part of this change, OpenAI is retiring Standard Voice Mode. In practice, that means the company can now offer a better voice experience to everyone since it doesn't need to fall back on Standard Voice Mode, which isn't natively multi-modal like Advanced Voice and therefore worse at understanding the nuances of human speech.\nIf you're wondering where this leaves OpenAI on the path toward artificial general intelligence, Altman had this to say when asked about the topic. \"I kind of hate the term AGI, because everyone at this point uses it to mean a slightly different thing, but [GPT-5] is a significant step forward towards models that are really capable. We're still missing something quite important,\" he said, noting GPT-5 can't continuously learn on its own. \"But the level of intelligence here, the level of capability, it feels like a huge improvement. Certainly, if I could go back five years before GPT-3 and you told me we have this now, I'd be like that's a significant fraction of the way to something very AGI-like.\"\nUpdate 2:00PM: Added more context about hallucination rates.  This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/gpt-5-is-here-and-its-free-for-everyone-170001066.html?src=rss",

Leucine is one of the three essential branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), along with isoleucine and valine, that are vital to muscle growth and repair. “You can rotate or combine them based on your routine and dietary goals,\" he says. It should be mixed with water and ideally taken after a workout. Clear whey protein is perfect for people who don’t like protein shakes or their milky disposition when served.It's best if you’re looking for a refreshing and light hydrating drink that won’t leave you stuffed after a workout. As long as you don’t have dairy allergies or sensitivities, a clear whey protein could be an option to have on hand on those hot summer days. Sometimes the residual lactose, artificial sweeteners or flavor additives can also trigger your stomach. Clear whey protein is a refreshing alternative to regular whey protein, particularly if you want something easily digestible after your workout or if you’re a heavy sweater. You can switch up the type of whey protein you take after your workouts, but like most supplements, clear whey protein should be taken alongside a well-balanced diet that works for your lifestyle and needs."

    "full_text": "But Barbarian also worked surprisingly well as a commentary on who really benefits from the redevelopment of decaying cities. Barbarian’s unpredictable tonal shifts and impressive production value made it feel like Cregger had captured lightning in a bottle — the kind that is often difficult to replicate. Though Barbarian wasn’t exactly subtle, Weapons pretty immediately establishes its themes about what motivates mob mentalities and mass hysteria. And yet, you would be hard-pressed to guess what the movie has in store. The film opens on Justine Gandy (Julia Garner), an enthusiastic third grade teacher with a deep affection for her students. Whatever school board policies Justine might have broken in the past, parents like Archer Graff (Josh Brolin) don’t seem all that concerned because she’s never done anything that would suggest she harmed them. That is until every single one of Justine’s students — save for a quiet boy named Alex (Cary Christopher) — disappears in the middle of the night. Cregger spells out just enough of what’s going on to make the movie read, on one level, as a dark allegory for the devastation caused by school shootings. But one of Weapons’ more impressive feats is the way it builds on that contentious dynamic to make a point about how communities often conjure up convenient boogeymen to blame, rather than confronting the things that actually endanger children. That feels like one of the bigger ideas Cregger is trying to get at through Weapons’ Rashomon-inspired structure, which revisits a series of key moments from different characters’ perspectives."

The character models were detailed, but not to an exceptional degree. It was filled with different pieces that felt authentic for the time period -- symphonic strings and other classical Italian fare -- yet also dramatic and really added to those tense moments.

    "summary": "The PS5 might be lacking the cadence of first-party exclusives that made its predecessor so successful, but that doesn’t appear to be slowing it down. Sony has announced that the console had shifted just north of 80 million units as of June 30, 2025. This puts it just behind the Xbox 360 (84 million) and well on the way to overtaking the PS3 (around 87 million) in lifetime sales.\nThe 80.3 million figure was confirmed in Sony’s first set of quarterly results for the current financial year, during which time it sold 2.5 million PS5s, a slight downturn from 2.8 million in the previous quarter. Compared to the same period in the last financial year, however, the company has actually shifted around 100,000 more consoles in the last three months.\nSony also sold approximately 66 million PS4 and PS5 games this quarter, almost 7 million of which were first-party titles. That’s around a 12 million year-on-year increase in overall software sales. Digital accounted for 83 percent of PS4 and PS5 games sold in the last quarter, which is a larger share than in any three-month period in the previous financial year.\nThe last few years saw Sony briefly shift its focus towards live service games, but one of those was a well-documented disaster, and others have since been cancelled. Clearly none of that has noticeably hurt software sales, though, as Sony has continued to grow in that area.\nThe PS5 turns five this November, and attention will then turn to whether it will hit the all-important 100 million mark in its lifetime. The PS4 managed that in five years and seven months, and at the time it was the fastest console to reach that number. It also didn’t have to contend with tariffs. PS5 prices increased in the UK, Australia and New Zealand earlier this year, with Sony blaming a “challenging economic environment” in which it is fighting against high inflation and fluctuating exchange rates. The company has since said it is not ruling out moving PS5 manufacturing to the US in the future.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/ps5-sales-have-passed-the-80-million-mark-161131719.html?src=rss",

This puts it just behind the Xbox 360 (84 million) and well on the way to overtaking the PS3 (around 87 million) in lifetime sales. The 80.3 million figure was confirmed in Sony’s first set of quarterly results for the current financial year, during which time it sold 2.5 million PS5s, a slight downturn from 2.8 million in the previous quarter. Compared to the same period in the last financial year, however, the company has actually shifted around 100,000 more consoles in the last three months. Sony also sold approximately 66 million PS4 and PS5 games this quarter, almost 7 million of which were first-party titles. That’s around a 12 million year-on-year increase in overall software sales. Digital accounted for 83 percent of PS4 and PS5 games sold in the last quarter, which is a larger share than in any three-month period in the previous financial year. The last few years saw Sony briefly shift its focus towards live service games, but one of those was a well-documented disaster , and others have since been cancelled. Clearly none of that has noticeably hurt software sales, though, as Sony has continued to grow in that area."

Early access, which started at 1 a.m. PT on Aug. 7. First open beta weekend available to all, starting at 1 a.m. PT on Aug. 9 and closing Aug. 11 at 1 a.m. PT. Simply download the Battlefield 6 beta client from your preferred platform. Doing a preload means you'll be able to jump on the beta as soon as it's available instead of waiting for it to download on the day of access. DICE is also adding additional days to get an early access code for those who missed out last week. Watch a single streamer participating in the Battlefield 6 Early Access Beta Key Drops for 30 minutes -- if you're having trouble finding one, search for \"Battlefield 6\" and look for streams that include \"Beta Key Drops\" or often just \"Drops\" in their titles. Players who have participated in Battlefield Labs, studio DICE's prerelease feedback program for the game, will be granted early access to play the beta starting Aug. 7. Just like with the maps, each weekend will also feature certain game modes. A special note if you haven't played a Battlefield game on PC recently: Studio DICE and EA recently started requiring players to set their computers to Secure Boot when playing Battlefield games to combat cheaters, and Battlefield 6 is no different."

Duolingo stock rose almost 30% on the news. In April, CEO Luis von Ahn shared that Duolingo would become an “AI-first” company, phasing out its use of contract workers. “Without AI, it would take us decades to scale our content to more learners,” von Ahn wrote at the time. While some Duolingo users have argued that these AI features are making the app worse, the company’s financial metrics tell a different story. Now the company anticipates making over $1 billion in revenue this year, and daily active users have grown 40% year-over-year. The growth is significant but falls in the lower range of the company’s estimates of growing between 40% and 45%, which an investor brought up to von Ahn on Wednesday’s quarterly earnings call. “The reason we came [in] towards the lower end was because I said some stuff about AI, and I didn’t give enough context. Snarky commenters will ask if videos with multiple people in them are made with AI, to which Duolingo will reply, “Nope. But even if public sentiment toward Duolingo has shifted, its bottom line has not … and from the company’s perspective, that’s what matters."

    "summary": "The most obvious question is “Why?”\nFramework builds modular, repairable laptops that anyone can take apart and put back together again. It’s a big deal in an era where laptops are regularly sold as a single unit that, should one part break, goes in the trash. Since every part of a Framework machine can be swapped out, you can keep one going for as long as your patience, and the supply of spare parts, allows. Desktops, however, are already modular and repairable — company founder Nirav Patel said “desktop PC ethos was one of the core inspirations for the Framework laptop to begin with.” So, if desktops are already modular and repairable, why do we need one from Framework? \nWhen the Desktop was announced, Patel said the genesis of the product came from seeing a preview of AMD’s Ryzen AI Max. It’s an APU (Accelerated Processing Unit) — AMD’s term for a chip combining a CPU, GPU and NPU in a single package, much like Apple Silicon — with plenty of hyped-up claims about its performance. Those claims were so compelling that Patel added the Desktop to the company’s roadmap just to harness that potential power. The big selling point for this chip is the sheer volume of RAM you can employ (up to 128GB) and the massive memory bandwidth (up to 265GB/s) it can take advantage of. AMD described it as a “workstation-level” chip that’ll work in a regular ‘ol PC, with the base model priced at $1,099.\nBut there’s a devil’s bargain in opting for such a powerful chip, since to get it means Framework has had to give up a lot of its founding principles. As someone probably once wrote, for what shall it profit a computer manufacturer if it shall gain searing power but lose its own soul?\n \nHardware\nThe major issue with the Ryzen AI Max is its inflexibility since it’s made as a single package. Much like Apple Silicon products, you’ll need to pick your chip spec in the knowledge that you don’t get to change things later. Consequently, you’ll be ordering the Framework Desktop in one of three unchangeable flavors:\n\nRyzen AI Max 385 with 32GB RAM, Radeon 8050S GPU\nRyzen AI Max+ 395 with 64GB RAM, Radeon 8060S GPU (the model I’m testing).\nRyzen AI Max+ 395 with 128GB RAM, Radeon 8060S GPU\n\nWith every other Framework machine, the mainboard has the CPU and fan soldered in place, but that’s it. Every other component can more or less be removed and reinstalled on the replacement mainboard. Here, if that APU goes or if your needs do evolve, then you’re losing pretty much everything (including the heatsink) since it’s all soldered to the mainboard. We'll get into pricing considerations later, but replacement mainboards from Framework run between $799 and $1,699. Otherwise, the only things you can recover here are the Wi-Fi module, SSD (there’s space for two), power supply and case.\nSpeaking of which, the Framework Desktop is a Mini-ITX desktop in a 4.5L case, complete with optional carrying handle. It’s less understated than the cases you’d have seen at a LAN party circa 2006, but that’s not the point. While the box itself is a stark black, you can add a big chunk of personality to it with the front panel, which has space for 21 plastic tiles. These tiles come in a variety of colors (including black, green, orange and lavender) for you to mosaic to your heart’s content. You can also pick up single tiles with specific images printed on, including the Framework, AMD and Linux logos, plus this fetching pride heart. Naturally, if you’re crafty, you can also make your own.\nBelow the front panel and irritatingly small power button, you’ll find two of Framework’s trademark expansion card slots. These are USB-C ducts into which you can slot any of the company’s expansion cards, letting you pick and choose what I/O you have up front. But the flexibility, so necessary on a laptop, is less of an issue here since this is a Mini-ITX mainboard. Lean over to the back and you’ll find two USB-C, two DisplayPorts, two USB-A sockets as well as dedicated connections for HDMI, Ethernet and 3.5mm audio.\nInstallation\nFramework is only selling its desktop in a “DIY Edition,” but that’s less of a big deal than you might initially expect. Whereas the company’s DIY laptops require you to put every component in the chassis, on the Desktop there’s very little to do at all. Everything bar the SSD is already in place, and all you need to do to add that is remove the heatsink and slot your drive into the M.2 slot. After that, you just need to attach the beefy 120mm fan to the equally beefy heatsink, pop the cowl on top and screw in the four screws. Framework’s wonderful iFixit-style guides claimed getting the hardware together would take between 30 and 45 minutes. I hit stop on the watch after 15 minutes and 15 seconds, and can’t imagine many folks will take much more time than that to put everything together. From there, you just need to install your operating system of choice and you’re ready to go.\nIn use\n\n\n\n\n   Daniel Cooper for Engadget \n \n\nWith the Desktop, Framework is targeting two groups: gamers, and developers eager to use AMD’s Ryzen AI Max. The pitch to the former group could easily be boiled down to ‘this is a fast PC you don’t need to do much to build.’ That’s an easy enough metric to judge it by, since we can just run some games on it and see how well it performs. I’ll admit that I am not an AI developer, and so can’t speak as authoritatively on the latter or how effective it would be at running large models if you — as the company expects — buy several mainboards to run in a cluster.\nI basically ran every title in my admittedly limited game library with the settings dialed up to max, and it didn’t break a sweat. AMD claims the Radeon 8060S GPU inside my machine goes toe-to-toe with an RTX 4070 laptop GPU. This is a ten pound hammer for the one ounce nail that is Fortnite, but even demanding titles like Hardspace: Shipbreaker breezed through. My gut tells me, however, that people wouldn’t be eyeing this up as a primary gaming machine. That’s not where this unit’s power lies, really, but in the more work-y tasks that better suit the APU.\nAs I said, I’m not an AI developer but I did mess around with LM Studio, which I tested with a chatbot running Google’s Gemma 3 27B model. Performance was a little slower than you may see on a web-based AI client, but not enough for it to be an issue. LM Studio, too, suggested that running this was only taking around a third of the Desktop’s CPU power, so there’s probably plenty more headroom there to run bigger and more demanding models.\nI am, however, on surer footing with big workstation tasks, like video editing and exporting, and I was impressed with the results here. For this, I took a 39GB HD video file with a runtime of 2 hours, made a few minor trims, and then compressed and exported it as an MP4 file. Crunching the file down to 6GB took just one hour and 12 minutes, a staggering speed boost for a job that could take half a day to export on lesser hardware. It’s worth remembering, too, that I’m testing the middle-tier version of the Desktop with 64GB RAM.\nWhen announcing the Desktop, Patel said the machine would run quietly even at peak power. He described it as “silent while sitting on your desktop under normal loads, and even under gaming, it’s impressively quiet.” If you’re familiar with Framework’s track record and products so far, that quote will have instantly provoked scoffing. The company does many things well, but it wildly overpromises on how quiet and cool its machines run.\nFramework trumpeted how much better its cooling was on its recently-released Ryzen AI 300 mainboard for the Laptop 13, which was noisy and lap roasting. Here, you’ve got a beefy APU expected to run for sustained periods of time at 120W and up to 140W in boost. I half expected to be able to use this thing as a space heater but, mercifully, the company does seem to have made good on its promises. The 120mm fan barely got noisy at all, and I can only recall it becoming noticeable when running heavier AI models in LM Studio and when I started exporting the video file.\nPricing\nThe starting price for the base model Desktop with the Max 385 and 32GB of RAM is $1,099. For that, you’ll get the case, power supply and mainboard, which includes its own Wi-Fi module. What the company is listing as optional extras, however, includes the SSD, CPU fan, OS and even the power lead. So, if you were looking to buy the base model as an essentially off the shelf purchase, including decorative tiles and two front-facing expansion cards, the price rises to $1,386. If you want to opt for the mid-tier option (the 395 with 64GB RAM) add $500 to the base model price. If you want to go for the high end 395 with 128GB RAM, then you’ll be adding $900 to the base price, bringing the total for an off-the-shelf model to around $2,286.\nBecause of the distinct nature of the Ryzen AI Max, an apples-to-apples comparison isn’t going to be perfect. But, if you were looking to spend around two grand on a high-performance PC, you could snag something like Lenovo’s Legion Tower 5 with AMD. $2,200 buys you a Ryzen 7 with 16GB DDR5 RAM, a 1TB SSD and NVIDIA’s GeForce RTX 4070 Ti with 12GB RAM. Alternatively, that figure could get you an ASUS ROG G700 with a Ryzen 7, Radeon RX 9070 XT Prime (with 16GB VRAM), 16GB RAM and a 2TB SSD. The real differentiator is how much you would value the faster memory bandwidth and speed the AI Max offers over its discrete rivals.\nFramework will also sell users the Desktop’s mainboard on its own, with the base model priced at $799. Certainly, if you’ve got boxes full of spare parts and the necessary Mini-ITX case, you could save a chunk of change that way. This will also be the most cost effective way for power users to run clusters of boards for bigger projects. Pre-orders are open, but the company won’t start shipping boards on their own until it’s fulfilled all of its system orders.\nWrap-up\nIn my time with the Framework Desktop, I’ve flip-flopped a few times on if this product is a hit or a miss. Framework was open about the fact this was something akin to a side project, outside its regular remit to build modular laptops, based on a particularly exciting chip. So while I think the all-in-one approach is a backward step compared to regular PCs, I get the rationale for doing so here.\nWhere I think Framework whiffed was to pitch this as a machine to make “PC gaming more accessible” by reducing “the mental and physical load” associated with building your own. Nightmares about thermal paste aside, I don’t think that’s a real issue for would-be gamers as they could easily pick up a pre-built system for similar cash. And I suspect most gamers would much rather use a PC with a standalone graphics card rather than slum it with an integrated GPU.\nBecause even mentioning gaming, really, does the machine a massive disservice, pulling the focus from its real strength. Which is the ease at which this machine handled productivity tasks, like running AI models and crunching video. The effortlessness at which it handled that brought to mind products like the Mac Studio, a creative powerhouse in its own tiny package. It’s this that Framework should have led with, especially since it’ll do all of those tasks and play games on the side.\nI’m not sure I’d recommend this product to people who are just looking to buy a powerful PC or a gaming PC. It’s a tool for a specific group of users capable of taking advantage of the AI Max’s benefits that you’d otherwise need a workstation for. So while its review score is justifiably high when the Framework Desktop is judged on its own merits, that doesn’t mean you need to own one.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/framework-desktop-2025-review-powerful-but-perhaps-not-for-everyone-150011909.html?src=rss",
    "full_text": "Framework builds modular , repairable laptops that anyone can take apart and put back together again. Consequently, you’ll be ordering the Framework Desktop in one of three unchangeable flavors: Ryzen AI Max+ 395 with 64GB RAM, Radeon 8060S GPU (the model I’m testing). Every other component can more or less be removed and reinstalled on the replacement mainboard. Here, if that APU goes or if your needs do evolve, then you’re losing pretty much everything (including the heatsink) since it’s all soldered to the mainboard . Framework’s wonderful iFixit-style guides claimed getting the hardware together would take between 30 and 45 minutes. I’ll admit that I am not an AI developer, and so can’t speak as authoritatively on the latter or how effective it would be at running large models if you — as the company expects — buy several mainboards to run in a cluster. I basically ran every title in my admittedly limited game library with the settings dialed up to max, and it didn’t break a sweat. The company does many things well, but it wildly overpromises on how quiet and cool its machines run. Where I think Framework whiffed was to pitch this as a machine to make “PC gaming more accessible” by reducing “the mental and physical load” associated with building your own."

    "full_text": "That's what made the 2025 Porsche Taycan 4S Cross Turismo such a standout. Porsche doesn't scream about it in bold letters, but those upgrades give you an extra 40 to 50 miles of range depending on spec and driving style. I first picked the car up from Porsche HQ with around 86% charge remaining, reading 272 miles of range in Sport Plus mode. I quickly learned that this wasn't an optimistic estimate like most other EVs. After around five hours of mixed driving -- some sporty backroad shenanigans, some motorway cruising, a little crawling through town -- I looked down and the car was actually going to make it the whole trip. The Provence paint might not have been my go-to color on paper, but in person? And it's not all show; I used that space on my rather long roadtrip. And once you've ticked a few of those tasty Porsche option boxes? That's steep, sure, but for the right buyer -- someone who wants a proper performance car that happens to be electric -- it might just be worth every penny. And you won't ever have to think twice about whether the car can make it on a longer drive."

During Nintendo's Indie World stream on Thursday, it emerged that Ball x Pit is coming to Switch, PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S and Game Pass on October 15. A Switch 2 version will arrive later this year.\nBall x Pit is a bit like if Breakout, Vampire Survivors and Space Invaders were blended together with a pinch of base building thrown in for good measure. Your character will (manually or automatically, it's up to you) fire destructive balls at waves of enemies that approach from the top of the screen, trying to destroy them before they reach the bottom and cause more damage. You'll collect more types of balls and augmentations throughout each run and upgrade both.\nThe action really kicks up a notch when you're able to fuse two balls and combine their effects. A fusion might grant you a ghost ball that passes through enemies but sticks a lightning rod into each one it makes contact with, dealing recurring damage to both that particular bad guy and others nearby. There are more than 60 different balls to play around with and combining a pair frees up a slot for another one, so you can end up with truly wild builds. You'll also unlock more characters with unique skills that you'll want to experiment with too.\nAlong with the brick-breaking action, there's a base-building element to Ball x Pit. You can help expand the settlement of New Ballbylon (chef's kiss on that name) with dozens of different buildings that can help you unlock more power-ups, characters and so on. The two sides of the game feed into each other and make for a very sticky, satisfying loop.\nAccording to Devolver, Ball x Pit had the 12th most-played demo during the most recent Steam Next Fest. More than 270,000 people have tried it out on Steam (demo progress carries over to the full game). Ball x Pit is easily one of my most anticipated games for the rest of the year.

DualFlow Tangle-Free System: Narwal calls this a system, but it’s a fairly common feature among robot vacuums, which use various methods to prevent brush tangles or to disentangle themselves. There’s also a 480mm detergent reservoir that should last for two months before needing to be refilled. Other parts of the Flow’s feature set are more standard and ones we typically expect to see on robot vacuums. While mopping, the Flow’s mop pops out to clean within 0.19 inches of walls and corners for full edge-to-edge coverage. The robot itself is 3.7 inches tall, allowing it to navigate under lower furniture such as beds and sofas."

    "full_text": "Bouygues Telecom, the third-largest phone carrier in France, has confirmed a cyberattack and data breach affecting millions of its customers. In a statement posted to its website, the telecommunications giant said the hack allowed the intruders to access the personal information on 6.4 million customer accounts. Bouygues said it detected the cyberattack on August 4, but did not give a time frame for when the breach was remediated. In a separate page dedicated to victims of the cyberattack, Bouygues said the stolen data includes customers’ contact information and contractual data, their civil status (or company data if the subscriber is a professional), as well as IBANs, or international bank account numbers. Bouygues said it has about 26.9 million mobile customers. The cyberattack has been reported to France’s data protection agency, CNIL. At the time of publication, Bouygues’ web page about the cyberattack contained a hidden “noindex” tag in its source code, which instructs search engines to ignore the page, making it difficult for anyone searching the web to find the page. A spokesperson for Bouygues did not immediately respond to a request for comment asking for details about the cyberattack, or explain why the page was hidden from search engines. News of the breach comes soon after a cyberattack at French telecom giant Orange, the country’s largest phone carrier and one of the largest telecommunication companies in the world. On July 29, Orange told customers to expect disruption as it moved to “isolate potentially affected services.” Orange serves more than 290 million customers worldwide."

These videos are not just professionally shot; they've got style. Princess Tiana's Bayou Adventure theme ride is featured in one video.

David James/Paramount Pictures Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation (2015) Netflix just released the first five movies in the Mission: Impossible franchise and while we really enjoy them all, 2015's Rogue Nation is one of our favorites. After reconnecting, the two friends explore their friendship and wonder what might have been had Nora never left. Grug doesn't always welcome learning new things from a human and Eep's curious, sometimes rebellious ways also contribute to family disagreements. Taylour Paige, Colman Domingo and Glynn Turman all co-star in the film that was adapted from August Wilson's 1982 play. Rustin's outspoken activism and homosexuality made him a target -- not just for political adversaries but sometimes even among his allies. After surviving an encounter with Godzilla, he and others realize the kaiju is gearing up to attack Tokyo.

As TechCrunch previously reported, parts of Section 8, as well as the entirety of Section 9 and Section 10, were deleted from Article 1 of the Constitution on the U.S. government’s official website over the past month. The changes to the sections, which pertained to congressional powers, the rights of individual states, and the rights to due process, sparked alarm at a time when the Trump administration has threatened to suspend habeas corpus. After the changes were reported, the Library of Congress tweeted that the sections were missing due to a “coding error.” TechCrunch reached out to the Library of Congress and received more insight into the issue: “This prevented publication of everything in Article I after the middle of Section 8. The problem has been corrected, and our updated constitutional analysis is now available. We are taking steps to prevent a recurrence in the future,” said Ryan. XML is a commonly used markup language used by the Library of Congress to format its website. A missing closing tag could plausibly result in missing text from the website, as anything outside of the tag would be ignored."

    "summary": "Finding a laptop that can juggle both gaming and schoolwork isn’t as tricky as it used to be. These days, you don’t have to choose between a machine that can handle your homework and one that can keep up with your favorite games. Whether you’re diving into an essay, editing video for a project or hopping into a round of Fortnite or Baldur’s Gate 3 after class, there are plenty of laptops that strike the right balance between performance, portability and price.The key is knowing what to look for. A solid schoolwork and gaming laptop should have enough processing power for multitasking, a GPU that can handle modern games (even if you're not cranking settings to ultra) and decent battery life to get you through a day of classes or study sessions. Some are sleek and lightweight enough to slip into a backpack while others double as full-on gaming rigs when you’re home and plugged in. We’ve tested a range of laptops to help you find one that fits your student schedule and your Steam library.\nBest laptops for gaming and school in 2025\n \n \n \n \n \nBest laptop for gaming and schoolwork FAQs\nAre gaming laptops good for school?\nAs we’ve mentioned, gaming laptops are especially helpful if you're doing any demanding work. Their big promise is powerful graphics performance, which isn't just limited to PC gaming. Video editing and 3D rendering programs can also tap into their GPUs to handle laborious tasks. While you can find decent GPUs on some productivity machines, like Dell's XPS 15, you can sometimes find better deals on gaming laptops. My general advice for any new workhorse: Pay attention to the specs; get at least 16GB of RAM and the largest solid state drive you can find (ideally 1TB or more). Those components are both typically hard to upgrade down the line, so it’s worth investing what you can up front to get the most out of your PC gaming experience long term. Also, don’t forget the basics like a webcam, which will likely be necessary for the schoolwork portion of your activities. \nThe one big downside to choosing a gaming notebook is portability. For the most part, we'd recommend 15-inch models to get the best balance of size and price. Those typically weigh in around 4.5 pounds, which is significantly more than a three-pound ultraportable. Today's gaming notebooks are still far lighter than older models, though, so at least you won't be lugging around a 10-pound brick. If you’re looking for something lighter, there are plenty of 14-inch options these days. And if you're not into LED lights and other gamer-centric bling, keep an eye out for more understated models that still feature essentials like a webcam (or make sure you know how to turn those lights off).\nDo gaming laptops last longer than standard laptops?\nNot necessarily — it really depends on how you define \"last longer.\" In terms of raw performance, gaming laptops tend to pack more powerful components than standard laptops, which means they can stay relevant for longer when it comes to handling demanding software or modern games. That makes them a solid choice if you need a system that won’t feel outdated in a couple of years, especially for students or creators who also game in their downtime.\nBut there’s a trade-off. All that power generates heat, and gaming laptops often run hotter and put more strain on internal components than typical ultraportables. If they’re not properly cooled or regularly maintained (think dust buildup and thermal paste), that wear and tear can shorten their lifespan. They’re also usually bulkier and have shorter battery life, which can impact long-term usability depending on your daily needs.\nGaming laptops can last longer performance-wise, but only if you take good care of them. If your needs are light — browsing, writing papers and streaming — a standard laptop may actually last longer simply because it’s under less stress day-to-day.\nWhat is the role of GPU in a computer for gaming and school?\nThe GPU plays a big role in how your laptop handles visuals — and it’s especially important if you’re using your computer for both gaming and school.\nFor gaming, the GPU is essential. It’s responsible for rendering graphics, textures, lighting and all the visual effects that make your favorite titles look smooth and realistic. A more powerful GPU means better frame rates, higher resolutions and the ability to play modern games without lag or stuttering.\nFor schoolwork, the GPU matters too — but its importance depends on what you're doing. If your school tasks mostly involve writing papers, browsing the web or using productivity tools like Google Docs or Microsoft Office, you don’t need a high-end GPU. But if you’re working with graphic design, video editing, 3D modeling or anything else that’s visually demanding, a good GPU can speed things up significantly and improve your workflow.\nGeorgie Peru contributed to this report.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/best-laptops-for-gaming-and-school-132207352.html?src=rss",

Both Samsung and Sony (along with Canon) have recently said that they're working on such chips.\nThe news marks a reconciliation of sorts between Apple and its frenemy Samsung. Apple stopped using Samsung in favor of TSMC as its primary contract manufacturer back in 2011, kicking off a decline in Samsung's chip business.

One big reason for Sony's domination is its cutting edge technology, having been first to market in nearly every major advance, including backside illumination, two-layer stacked sensors and global shutters on mirrorless cameras. According to a recent rumor, Sony was contemplating a spin-off its sensor division but held back due to Trump's tariffs. \n\"We remain confident that we are advanced in providing sensor technology to our customers, and we will focus on continuing further technological advancement through larger sensor size and density,\" Sony said in a statement in response to the news from Apple. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/apple-is-reportedly-working-with-samsung-to-build-iphone-image-sensors-in-texas-120021281.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "The Nintendo Switch 2 is here, and that means a whole lot more people will eventually need a new microSD card. While the new console comes with 256GB of built-in storage — eight times more than the original Switch and four times more than the Switch OLED — its improved performance means that some games will chew up a ton of that space. Cyberpunk 2077 is a 59GB download, for example, while Split Fiction checks in at 69GB. Other titles aren’t nearly as big (particularly those made by Nintendo itself), but chances are you’ll want to add more room at some point down the road.\nWhenever that is, you’ll need a microSD Express card. This is not the same as the old reliable microSD cards you may have bought for the first Switch or other gaming handhelds — they’re newer, faster and far more expensive. But if you want more space, they’re your only choice. If you’re looking to grab one today, we’ve laid out the best microSD cards for the Switch 2 and broken down what you should know before you buy. \nThe best microSD cards for the Switch 2 (aren't all that important)\n\n\n\n\n  Jeff Dunn for Engadget\n \n\nThe Switch 2 is the first mainstream device to require microSD Express for storage expansion, so there aren’t many options available to buy just yet. Of the six compatible models we’ve seen thus far, we’ve tested five: the SanDisk microSD Express Card, the Lexar Play Pro, the Samsung microSD Card for Nintendo Switch 2, the PNY microSD Express Card and the GameStop Express microSD Card for Nintendo Switch 2. The first four are made by genuine storage manufacturers, while the GameStop card appears to be a rebadged version of another model. (This should be the case with another card sold by Walmart under its Onn sub-brand, which we hope to catch in stock before our next update.) We used the 256GB version of every card except for Lexar Play Pro, which was 1TB.\nAfter timing these microSD Express cards across a range of Switch 2 games, our advice is simple: Get whichever one is available for the lowest price in the capacity you want. They aren’t identical, especially if you want to move a game to the card from the console’s internal storage (or vice versa). But the differences in load times and overall performance within actual games are tough to notice unless you have a stopwatch handy.\nAll five cards loaded up the digital version of Mario Kart World, for instance, between 18 and 20 seconds. Each loaded the first Grand Prix race in about 6.5 seconds. Getting to the start screen of Cyberpunk 2077 took about 38 seconds in each case. Loading a save in a particularly asset-heavy area (Jig-Jig Street) then took between 26 and 29 seconds, depending on the card.\nWith Fast Fusion, a smaller native Switch 2 game, the initial load always took six to seven seconds, while each card loaded the first championship race in roughly 4 seconds. It was a similar situation with the Switch 2 upgrade for The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild (using a Switch 1 cartridge): Each card took just over six seconds to get to the start screen, between 19 and 20 seconds to load a save just before the final boss, about 16 seconds to fast travel between Kakariko Village and Korok Forest, and so on. We saw no significant issues with in-game loads when playing each game, either.\n\n\n\n  The SanDisk microSD Express Card and Lexar Play Pro.\n \n\n  Jeff Dunn for Engadget\n \n\nAll of this suggests that the Switch 2 has a relatively specific target for these cards to hit, and that there may not be much room for one model to leap too far out in front of the others. We’ll also note that the console’s built-in storage was consistently faster than any external option: The gap wasn’t always big, but no card truly outpaced it in any of our tests. Loading that demanding area in Cyberpunk, for example, took about 22.5 seconds on average. So if you want the absolute fastest load times, don’t put your game on a card at all.\nIf you need the mental comfort of knowing you technically have the best card available, get the SanDisk microSD Express Card. It had no outliers across our many game loading tests, and it was consistently right near the top when it came to moving games to and from system storage, which means it offers strong sequential read and write performance. Benchmark testing on PC with tools like CrystalDiskMark backed this up, as noted in our broader microSD card buying guide.\n\n\nPutting Mario Kart (a 21.9GB file) on that card took four minutes and 39 seconds on average, which was only second to the Lexar Play Pro by six seconds. It was the fastest to write Fast Fusion (3.5GB), taking an average of 27 seconds across three runs. Only PNY’s card was faster to move games back to the console’s storage, but that one was far slower at writing games to the card — getting Mario Kart on there took seven minutes and 11 seconds on average. Just note that the 128GB version of SanDisk’s card has slower sequential writes than the larger versions, including much slower sustained write speeds (100 MB/s vs 210-220 MB/s). So transferring a game to that particular model will take much longer.\nPractically speaking, though, speed differences aren’t as important in this case as having lots of space to hold games at a price you can live with. To make things easy, we’ve listed every Express card we’ve seen at retailers at the time of writing below. Remember: You want microSD Express, not “Extreme,” like the branding SanDisk uses for some conventional microSD cards. A microSD Express card will have a big “EX” logo printed on it.\n128GB\n\nSanDisk microSD Express Card ($60 MSRP)\nPNY microSD Express Card ($47 MSRP)\n\n256GB\n\nSamsung microSD Express Card for Nintendo Switch 2 ($60 MSRP)\nSanDisk microSD Express Card ($73 MSRP)\nLexar Play Pro ($60 MSRP)\nPNY microSD Express Card ($61 MSRP)\nGameStop Express microSD Card for Nintendo Switch 2 ($60 MSRP)\nOnn microSD Express Card ($36 MSRP)\n\n512GB\n\nSanDisk microSD Express Card ($125 MSRP)\nLexar Play Pro ($120 MSRP)\nGameStop Express microSD Card for Nintendo Switch 2 ($100 MSRP)\nOnn microSD Express Card ($66 MSRP)\n\n1TB\n\nLexar Play Pro ($220 MSRP)\nGameStop Express microSD Card for Nintendo Switch 2 ($190 MSRP)\n\n\n\n\n  All microSD Express cards will have this \"EX\" logo printed on them.\n \n\n  Nintendo/Engadget\n \n\nAs you can see, while the SanDisk card is fast, it’s also the most expensive of an already-pricey bunch. Is it worth an extra $10-20 to shave a couple seconds off certain loads in certain games, or a couple minutes when moving a game to external storage? Probably not for most people.\nBut stock for all of these cards has been patchy since the Switch 2 landed, especially for the Walmart Onn model, which is by far the cheapest choice. If only one card is actually available by the time you read this — and you must have it today — it’s safe to just get it. You won’t lose or gain all that much when it comes to real-world performance.\nUltimately, though, we advise holding off on buying any microSD Express card for as long as possible. President Trump’s tariff shenanigans could spike prices a little higher in the short term, but in general, all of these cards are about as expensive today as they’ll ever be. And compared to traditional microSD options, they are pricey: The Samsung Pro Plus, for example, costs $17 for 128GB, $25 for 256GB, $43 for 512GB and $90 for 1TB as of this writing.\nThe Switch 2 is extremely popular, so more microSD Express cards will need to be made and prices will (eventually) come down. Ideally, we’ll see more high-capacity options as well: Nintendo says the Switch 2 technically supports cards up to 2TB, but so far only a couple even go up to 1TB. All of this means you should try to use all 256GB baked into the Switch 2 first, even if it means having to delete a game or two. But if you absolutely need more space right away, the cards above should be fine.\nWhat are microSD Express cards?\n\n\n\n  A microSD Express card like the one on the right has a second row of pins on the back.\n \n\n  Jeff Dunn for Engadget\n \n\nMost microSD cards are based on a standard called Ultra High Speed (UHS), of which there are three versions: UHS-I, UHS-II and UHS-III. The vast majority of cards you may have bought in the past utilize UHS-I. These have one row of pins in the back and a theoretical maximum data transfer speed of 104 megabytes per second (MB/s). (Though many cards are able to surpass that limit with proprietary tech and card readers.) The original Switch has a UHS-I microSD slot, as do most other gaming handhelds like Valve’s Steam Deck.\nUHS-II cards add a second row of pins and can reach up to 312 MB/s. These are pricier and much less common than cards based on UHS-I, but they’re supported by some cameras and higher-power handhelds like the ASUS ROG Ally X. UHS-III, meanwhile, is twice as fast as UHS-II in theory (624 MB/s), but no microSD cards have actually used it.\nUHS-I cards have held on over the years because they’re cheap, widely supported and fast enough for the things most people need them to do: record 4K video, stash photos and so on. But with the Switch 2, Nintendo needs more. The new console is dramatically more powerful, which allows it to run demanding games that may have originally been built for stronger hardware like the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X or gaming PCs. The device also uses UFS 3.1 storage internally, which is much speedier than the eMMC storage used by the original Switch. (A custom file decompression engine helps improve load times as well.) So if the Switch 2 is going to accept microSD cards, it needs ones that won’t bring a serious drop-off in performance and can hold up with modern games.\n\n\n\n  The Nintendo Switch 2.\n \n\n  Sam Rutherford for Engadget\n \n\nHence, SD Express. This standard has technically been around since 2018 but mostly went nowhere until the Switch 2 came along. It also uses a second row of pins, but it lets microSD cards take advantage of the PCI Express (PCIe)/NVMe interface, which is the same underlying tech used by modern SSDs. As a result, it can produce considerably faster read and write speeds, with a current theoretical maximum of 985 MB/s.\nAs noted above, real-world performance won’t be quite that fast. Even if it was, the best microSD Express cards would still be much slower than the NVMe SSDs used by the PS5 and Xbox. (Sony recommends SSDs with sequential read speeds of at least 5,500 MB/s.) And they’ll fall well below their peak speeds under sustained loads: SanDisk, for instance, says sustained write speeds for its 128GB Express card can drop as low as 100 MB/s.\nBut they’re still a marked improvement over old UHS-I cards, and in theory, they should be quicker than some older SATA-based SSDs when it comes loading game levels, asset streaming, retrieving saves or copying games to external storage. Whereas SanDisk’s microSD Express card can produce sequential read speeds around 900 MB/s, Lexar’s Professional Silver Plus — the top UHS-I pick in our general microSD card guide — topped out just over 200 MB/s, and that’s with a proprietary reader. (On the first Switch, it’d be closer to 100 MB/s.) Sequential writes and random speeds were three to four times better as well, and sometimes even more depending on the benchmark we used.\nIt remains to be seen how well these Express cards will hold up with years of use, and there’s no way to know exactly when their sky-high prices will drop. Non-Switch 2 devices that support microSD Express are still exceedingly rare, and the standard itself isn’t backwards compatible with UHS-II, so you’ll be limited to UHS-I speeds if you want to use your card with another device (unless you buy a pricey external reader). Still, while the increased costs and limited selection are annoying, the tech itself is worthy of a next-gen Switch.\nHow we test microSD Express cards\n\n\n\n\n  Jeff Dunn for Engadget\n \n\nWe put our microSD Express cards through a series of tests meant to simulate how people would use each card on the Switch 2 in the real world. We mainly worked with four games: a mid-sized title in Mario Kart World, a small one in Fast Fusion, a relatively large one in Cyberpunk 2077 and a hybrid in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, which ran off a Switch 1 cartridge but used a roughly 10GB Switch 2 upgrade pack that was downloaded and installed digitally.\nWe first timed how long it took to move each game from the system’s internal storage to the card in question, and vice versa. We then timed how long it took to load each game when installed to a given card. After that, we measured how quickly the cards could load certain in-game scenarios: the first Grand Prix race in Mario Kart; the first championship race in Fast Fusion; fast traveling between the Jig-Jig Street, Embers and Downtown Central areas in Cyberpunk and fast traveling between the Kakariko Village, Korok Forest and the Hyrule Castle Town Ruins areas in Zelda. (We chose those places in the latter two games because they’re more taxing than other regions.) With Cyberpunk and Zelda, we also timed how long it took to load up different save files in those locations.\nWith each test, we completed three to five runs to account for any irregularities and marked down the average time taken between them. We did each test in airplane mode, with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth off, to minimize any performance drain that could arise from background downloads. Between each test, we also spent at least an hour playing the games off each card to ensure there were no significant drop-offs compared to the console’s built-in storage.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/best-microsd-cards-for-nintendo-switch-2-160052947.html?src=rss",
    "full_text": "(This should be the case with another card sold by Walmart under its Onn sub-brand, which we hope to catch in stock before our next update.) But the differences in load times and overall performance within actual games are tough to notice unless you have a stopwatch handy. So if you want the absolute fastest load times, don’t put your game on a card at all. Benchmark testing on PC with tools like CrystalDiskMark backed this up, as noted in our broader microSD card buying guide. It was the fastest to write Fast Fusion (3.5GB), taking an average of 27 seconds across three runs. The original Switch has a UHS-I microSD slot, as do most other gaming handhelds like Valve’s Steam Deck. So if the Switch 2 is going to accept microSD cards, it needs ones that won’t bring a serious drop-off in performance and can hold up with modern games. This standard has technically been around since 2018 but mostly went nowhere until the Switch 2 came along. (We chose those places in the latter two games because they’re more taxing than other regions.) With Cyberpunk and Zelda, we also timed how long it took to load up different save files in those locations."

    "summary": "Choosing the best laptop can be a bit of a challenge — there are so many models, sizes and specs out there that it’s easy to feel lost in the shuffle. But the good news is that modern laptops are better than ever. Whether you're looking for a powerful AI PC, a travel-ready ultrabook or an affordable machine that can handle everyday tasks, there's something out there for everyone. Today’s systems combine improved performance, longer battery life and smarter features in sleek, lightweight designs that are built to keep up with work, play and everything in between.Out of all of the notebooks we've tested and reviewed recently, we consider Apple's 13-inch MacBook Air M4 to be the best laptop for most people, and this is still the case for our top picks to start off the new year. It's powerful enough to handle most tasks (even light video editing); it has a great screen and built-in speakers; and its battery could last over 18hours (depending on what you're doing, of course). The MacBook Air M4 is also one of the lightest and thinnest systems we've reviewed, and it's dead silent, thanks to a fanless design.Of course, not everyone wants a MacBook, and there are excellent Windows laptops and Chromebooks out there, too. Windows systems offer a range of configurations, from budget to high-end UHD screens with stunning IPS panels that boast high nits for vivid brightness. Chromebooks, on the other hand, tend to be more affordable and are great for users who mostly work online. Whether you need a powerhouse for creative work, a compact system for note-taking, or a laptop that can handle family movie night, there’s something for everyone in today’s laptop market.\nTable of contents\n\nBest laptops of 2025\nHow we test and pick laptops\nFactors to consider when choosing a laptop\nOther laptops we’ve tested\nLaptop FAQs\nRecent updates\n\nBest laptops of 2025\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBack to top \nHow we test laptops\nEngadget has been reviewing laptops for two decades, and while the definition of what a portable PC is has changed considerably since, our obsession with testing their limits and serving up informative buying advice remains the same. Be it a hybrid tablet like Microsoft's Surface machines, a rotating 2-in-1 convertible like HP's Spectre x360s or a plain old clamshell notebook, our review process follows similar beats. How does it look and feel? How fast is it? Whether it’s a Windows device powered by an Intel Core i5 or higher, a MacBook or a Chromebook, we aim to answer the most important question: Is it actually worth your hard-earned cash? We also pay close attention to portability, webcam quality and display features, including IPS panels and nits of brightness, as they can make a big difference in daily use.\nBack to top\nFactors to consider when choosing a laptop\nOperating system: Apple, Windows or Chrome OS\nThere's a good chance you've already committed to an operating system, but my advice is to be as flexible as possible. These days, most major software is compatible with both Macs and PCs. (Of course, it's another story if you've become dependent on an Apple-only app like Final Cut Pro.) Web-based apps, naturally, will work on any platform with an internet browser.\nIf you're an Apple-loyalist, there aren't many reasons to consider Windows laptops (unless you want a secondary gaming machine). But for Windows users, macOS is becoming more tempting every year. Apple's MacBooks, powered by its M-series Silicon chips, are among the fastest and most efficient laptops we've ever seen. They're incredibly well-built and have outstanding battery life to boot. MacOS itself is also an easy platform to learn, especially if you're used to iOS and iPadOS.\nThat brings up another point: iPhone users may want to consider Macs because of the seamless integration with Apple's other platforms. You can't respond to iMessage conversations easily or hop into FaceTime chats on Windows PCs, but doing so is simple on Macs. (Microsoft's Phone Link app lets you send iOS users individual texts, but not media or group chats.) Android users, meanwhile, may be better off with Windows, as Phone Link can make calls, synchronize all your texts and also access your phone's photos.\nIf cloud gaming is your priority, Windows laptops with NVIDIA’s GeForce Now or Xbox Cloud Gaming compatibility may offer more flexibility and decent performance, especially when paired with fast internet speeds. Chromebooks also make a compelling case here as an affordable, lightweight solution for casual cloud gaming sessions.\nAs for whether you’ll want a PC with a dedicated Copilot AI button on the keyboard, that depends on how often you see yourself using Microsoft’s generative tools. Given we’re only just seeing the first slate of AI PCs, it would be wiser to wait out the hype and see what improvements might come over time.\nAnd what about ChromeOS? Chromebooks are a smart and (typically) inexpensive way to do things like web browsing and hopping on a few video chats, but for most, they're not the best choice as a primary computer. There aren't many apps or games that work offline, and they also don't work with powerful software suites like Adobe's (you can use the stripped-down Adobe Express and Photoshop online tools, though).\nChromebooks are great secondary machines to use alongside a more powerful Mac or PC, and they're popular in schools because they're cheap and easy for IT workers to manage. And if all you need is web browsing access, or a notebook for a kid, a Chromebook might be enough.\nIf, for some reason, you’re looking for a powerful ChromeOS system, there are also Chromebook Plus models to consider. These machines sport faster processors and more RAM than typical Google notebooks, and they can also tap into a few of the company’s online AI features, like AI image generation and photo processing.\nPrice\nYou can expect to spend between $1,000 and $1,800 for a new laptop these days, depending on the configuration. If you're looking for more of a workhorse, that could cost you well over $2,000 for additional RAM, storage, as well as a beefier graphics card and CPU. But you can also find some good laptops under $1,000 if you're willing to overlook build quality (or buy a refurbished or previous generation machine, which we highly recommend). Systems with AMD chips tend to come in cheaper than their Intel counterparts, but the bulk of their cost will come down to other components like RAM and storage.\nI’ve included our favorite affordable model in this best laptop buying guide, but we have a list of the best budget laptops that you can check out as well.\nLaptop size and weight\nSo how portable do you want your laptop to be? That's the ultimate question you need to ask when choosing between various screen sizes. 13-inch machines have become a solid starting point for most shoppers — it's enough real estate for the majority of tasks like emailing and writing, and it also helps keep machines relatively light (typically between two to three pounds). Thanks to manufacturing advancements, these dainty machines sometimes even come with larger screens (the smaller MacBook Air actually has a 13.6-inch display).\nIf you have trouble seeing fine text, we’d recommend going for a display larger than 13 inches. ASUS’s Zephyrus G14 is a solid 14-inch option for gamers, and we’re also seeing more productivity-focused machines aim for that size, like the Dell 14 Premium and MacBook Pro. While 14-inch notebooks are a bit heavier than 13-inch models, coming in between three to four pounds, their screens are noticeably roomier.\nFor artists, or anyone else who needs a large canvas, a 15-inch laptop may make the most sense. They typically weigh between 3.5 and 4.5 pounds, but that extra heft may be worth it to fit wider video editing timelines or Photoshop windows. And, as you'd expect, you'll also pay a bit more for a 15-inch notebook compared to smaller ones (the 15-inch MacBook Air starts at $1,199, while the smaller model goes for $999). PC makers are also replacing 15-inch systems with 16-inch versions, which will give you even more space to work.\nIf you're in the market for a business laptop, size and portability might be key considerations. A lightweight yet powerful system with a long battery life can make a world of difference if you travel frequently for work.\nYou can still find laptops with 17-inch or 18-inch screens, but those are typically gaming systems or souped-up workstations. They're not meant for mere computing mortals.\nPorts and connectivity\nThese days, most laptops ship with a few USB-C ports, which can handle both charging and speedy data transfers. Apple's MacBooks also include a separate connection for MagSafe power, and you'll find custom power connections on some PCs like Microsoft's Surface. Older USB Type-A connections are less common now, but they still pop up in systems like HP's Spectre x360 14, as well as many models from ASUS.\nFor gamers or creators who rely on discrete graphics, ensuring your laptop has the right ports for external monitors or GPUs is crucial. DisplayPort or HDMI connections can also ensure you’re ready for dual- or multi-screen setups for more immersive experiences. Similarly, if you want to save high-resolution files or install multiple games, you might need to consider additional hard drive space; external hard drives are pretty affordable, as long as you have a proper port to connect them.\nIf you're a fan of wired headphones, it's worth keeping a close eye on headphone jack availability. They usually include a USB-C to 3.5mm adapter, but that's a clunky solution, and it also takes up a USB port. Sure, most people use wireless earbuds and cans today, but it's still helpful to have a wired one around for when those devices run out of juice.\nMost laptops today offer Wi-Fi 6 or 6E and Bluetooth 5.0 or later, which should mean faster and more stable connections if you have compatible routers and devices. While Wi-Fi 7 routers have started appearing, that spec hasn't made its way into laptops yet. As for cellular coverage, there are notebooks like the Surface Pro 9 and Samsung Galaxy Book models that offer integrated 5G. But from our testing, that feature may not be worth the cost of a separate data plan. Instead, you could tether to your smartphone or invest in a wireless hotspot that can keep multiple devices online.\nBattery life\nA laptop's battery life depends on several factors: The power draw from the screen and other hardware, the optimizations used to avoid unnecessary power drain, and, of course, the size of the actual battery. One of our previous favorite systems, the Dell XPS 13, lasted 13 hours and 15 minutes in the PCMark 10 battery benchmark. In real-world testing, I was able to use it for a day and a half without needing a recharge. The MacBook Air 13-inch, meanwhile, more than 18 hours in our benchmark and kept running for more than two work days of my typical workflow. In general, you should expect a modern laptop to last at least eight hours.\nIf battery life is your absolute priority, I'd strongly suggest looking at Macs over Windows PCs. Apple's M-series chips are essentially mobile hardware, with all of the power efficiency you'd expect from something originally designed for phones. Qualcomm’s upcoming Snapdragon chips could help Windows PCs compete with Apple’s astonishing battery life, but we’ve yet to see those in action. Chromebooks also typically get decent battery life (as long as you don’t overstuff them with power-draining tabs).\nRefresh rate\nA laptop's refresh rate refers to the amount of times its screen is cycled every second. Modern displays like IPS LCDs and OLEDs support 60Hz refresh rates at a minimum, but we're seeing more devices offering 120Hz, 240Hz and beyond. The higher the number, the faster the screen is refreshed, which ultimately leads to a smoother experience while mousing around or scrolling through web pages. (If you want to get a sense of what a slow refresh rate looks like, just grab an e-reader like the Kindle and try to flip between book pages.)\nWhile high refresh rates used to be reserved for gaming laptops, nowadays we're seeing more mainstream machines like the Dell 14 Premium offer 120Hz (or variable rates that move between 60Hz and 120Hz).\nCPU & GPU\nIf you’re buying a new laptop, you’ll want to make sure it’s powered by the latest CPUs. For Windows PCs, that includes Intel’s Core Ultra chips for thin-and-light machines or the 14th-gen HX chips for beefier systems. The Core Ultra series have NPUs for handling AI tasks, while the HX hardware does not – they’re based on Intel’s previous chip architecture, and they’re more focused on delivering raw horsepower. Intel's older 13th-gen and 12th-gen laptop chips also don't have NPUs, so keep that in mind if you're looking at used systems.\nYou'll also see AMD's Ryzen 8000 and 9000 chips in plenty of new systems like the ASUS Zephyrus G14 and Razer Blade 14. Those CPUs mainly target gaming laptops and high performance systems, while you'll still find AMD’s older Ryzen 7000 chips in ultraportables. AMD's main advantage is that its chips also include Radeon graphics, which are far more capable than Intel's Arc hardware (though those are getting better).\nQualcomm’s new Snapdragon X Elite and X Plus are also an option in Copilot+ PCs (more on those below). Since they’re based on mobile chip designs, they’re likely also more power efficient than AMD and Intel’s hardware. In the past, we’ve avoided recommending Snapdragon chips because they led to a slow and frustrating Windows experience. But Microsoft claims it’s rebuilt Windows 11 around Snapdragon’s Arm-based architecture, which should lead to far faster performance and better app compatibility.\nAs for Apple's laptops, you'll be choosing between the M4, M4 Pro and M4 Max, each of which is progressively more powerful.\nOn the graphics side of things, a GPU, or graphics processing unit, is the component that communicates directly with a laptop's display. Laptop CPUs all have some form of integrated GPU: Intel has either its standard graphics or beefier Arc hardware, while AMD's chips include fast Radeon mobile graphics. If you want to play demanding games at high speeds (measured in frames per second, or fps), or if you need some extra power for rendering video or 3D models, you can configure a laptop with a dedicated GPU like NVIDIA's RTX 40-series hardware or AMD's Radeon RX 7000. Just be sure to leave room in your budget if you want a powerful GPU, as they typically add $300 or more to the cost of a laptop.\nApple's M-series chips, meanwhile, have GPU cores that can perform as well as NVIDIA’s and AMD's lower-end dedicated GPUs. That's quite the accomplishment for systems like this (especially the MacBook Air and 14-inch MacBook Pro), and it's another reason we highly recommend Apple's notebooks.\nAI PCs, NPUs and Copilot+\nSimply put, an AI PC is a computer equipped with a neural processing unit (NPU), which is designed to handle AI-related tasks. Much like how GPUs tackle heavy-duty gaming and rendering workloads, NPUs are designed to handle the complex math necessary for AI workloads. They’re also far more power efficient than CPUs or GPUs, which could lead to better battery performance in laptops. While many factors go into NPU performance, for the most part we measure their potential speed by TOPS (tera operations per second).\nWe were primed for AI PCs based on the chips Intel and AMD announced in 2023. Intel unveiled its \"Core Ultra\" CPUs in December, its first to include an NPU for AI work. AMD also announced its Ryzen 8040 AI mobile chips that month (and it couldn't help but say they were faster than Intel's new hardware). But in May, Microsoft announced its Copilot+ initiative, which is pushing major PC makers to deliver premium AI PCs with specifications including 16GB of RAM, 256GB SSDs and NPUs with at least 40 TOPS of AI performance.\nCopilot+ is more than just a marketing term: Microsoft is also launching AI-powered features in Windows 11 that take advantage of powerful NPUs. That includes Recall, which can help you locate anything you’ve done on your PC (whenever it finally launches), as well as Cocreator in Paint, which can generate AI images based on text prompts and doodles.\nIf you buy an AI PC that isn’t Copilot+ certified, you’ll still be able to use some features like Windows Studio Effects, which can blur your background in video calls or keep you in frame. Developers like Adobe and Audacity are also building features into their apps that can take advantage of NPUs.\nAt the time of this post, Chromebook Plus notebooks can also access a few of Google’s online AI features, like image generation and photo processing.\nBack to top\nOther laptops we tested\nLenovo ThinkPad X9-14 Aura Edition\nThe ThinkPad X9-14 Aura Edition is a great spiritual successor to the ThinkPad X1 Carbon, offering the best that business laptops have to offer. That includes long battery life packed into a thin and light chassis. This is an optimal ultraportable business laptop.\nWhile the price might give you some pause, we tested the lowest configuration, and found that the X9-14’s performance is excellent for casual business users. The only issue with quality is that the keyboard is lacking. It’s mushier than we’d like, which could get a bit tiresome throughout the day. You’ll still miss out on a USB Type-A port, so you may need to carry a Type-C hub with you.\nWhere the ThinkPad X9-14 will win you over is its bold OLED screen. Combo that with its well-rounded audio, and the ThinkPad X9-14 makes for an excellent multimedia device in and out of the workplace.\nASUS Zenbook 14 OLED\nAside from its lovely OLED screen, the ASUS Zenbook 14 OLED doesn't stand out from the crowded laptop field in any way. It just looks dull and boring, especially compared to the strikingly beautiful ASUS Zephyrus G14, which also came out this year. While you can probably find the Zenbook 14 for a decent price, I'd recommend holding out for something with a bit more personality (and with a less wobbly screen hinge).\nRazer Blade 14\nThe Razer Blade has almost everything you'd want in a 14-inch gaming notebook, but it's far pricier than the Zephyrus G14 on this list, and it doesn’t even have an SD card reader. It would be a solid competitor once its price falls a bit, and it's certainly a great option if you just have to have a jet-black laptop.\nFramework Laptop 16\nFramework gave its modularity magic to the Laptop 16, delivering a gaming notebook where almost every single component is user replaceable. But you'll have to pay a pretty penny to snag it with upgraded hardware, and its optional Radeon 7700S GPU was surprisingly slow.\nAlienware m16 R2\nThe Alienware m16 r2 has been revamped with a slimmer case, but it’s otherwise a fairly typical gaming laptop. It’s a solid option for Alienware fans, but you’ll find better hardware and deals elsewhere.\nASUS Zenbook Duo (2024)\nThe Zenbook Duo is a fascinating dual-screened notebook, and according to my colleague Sam Rutherford it’s the first of its kind that’s worth buying. But its unique hardware isn’t really meant for mainstream consumers, and Windows 11 still doesn’t support multi-screen setups well enough to make full use of the Zenbook Duo’s ample canvas.\nDell XPS 16\nDell’s XPS 16 is big and beautiful, but it’s far too expensive compared to the competition. Plus, it uses a capacitive row of function keys that you basically can’t see under bright light and has too few ports for a machine of this size.\nSee Also:\n\nBest Gaming Laptops for 2025\nBest Cheap Windows Laptops\nBest 2-in-1 Laptops for 2025\nBest Chromebooks\nBest Laptops for College Students\n\nBack to top\nLaptop FAQs\nWhat is the average battery life of a laptop per charge?\nIt’s hard to come up with an average battery life for laptops, since that will ultimately depend on what you’re doing with them. An ultraportable like the MacBook Air that sips power can last around 20 hours in our battery benchmark, and around two full work days of real-world usage. But a gaming laptop may last only a few hours if you’re actively playing something while on battery. At this point, Macs are delivering far better battery life than PCs, thanks to Apple’s Silicon chips, but Microsoft claims Copilot+ systems with Qualcomm chips will also get over 20 hours of batter life.\nHow much RAM do I really need?\nThe more RAM you have, the more things your computer can do simultaneously. For that reason, we recommend buying PCs and Macs with at least 16GB of RAM. That gives you enough memory to have several applications open at once, as well as web browsers filled with RAM-hogging tabs. Many PC games also require at least 16GB of RAM. While you could use a system with 8GB of RAM for basic tasks, you’ll quickly run into slowdowns and error messages as your apps stack up. Many laptops, especially ultraportables, don’t let you upgrade RAM, too – so you’ll have to buy an entirely new computer if you didn’t equip enough memory at the start.\nIf you’re a hardcore gamer, programmer or planning to render videos or 3D models, then you may want to go for 32GB of RAM or more. And if you just need a secondary laptop for lighter work – perhaps a no-frills system for writing – then you can probably get by with 8GB. Just be sure to keep those browser tabs in check.\nWhat is the best storage capacity for a laptop?\nThere is no one-size-fits-all solution when it comes to laptop storage. You’ll typically find configurations between 256GB and 1TB SSDs (solid state drives) on most laptops, and I’d recommend most people get at least 512GB. That’ll be enough space for large apps, music and video files without stressing your system too much. If you’re a media hoarder, or want to play a ton of games, then it’s definitely worth getting a 1TB SSD.\nIf you’ll mainly be streaming your shows and music, and would rather invest in RAM or other hardware, then 256GB of storage would be serviceable. I’d recommend staying away from any machine with 128GB of storage though. Most of that will be taken up by the operating system, and you’ll likely run into issues cramming in large apps after a few months.\nWe recommend springing for extra built-in storage or investing in a portable SSD for backing up your most important files. It's also worth noting that Chromebooks tend to come with less built-in storage — 32GB, 64GB or 128GB — since ChromeOS encourages users to save their files in the cloud rather than on the device. In that case, 128GB is plenty.\nWhat's a good price range for a decent laptop in 2025?\nYou can expect to spend between $1,000 and $1,800 for a typical 13-inch laptop today. As I explained above, you'll pay more if you want to stuff in more RAM or better GPU hardware. But you can also find deals below $1,000 if you look for refurbished or older-generation models.\nWhat’s the difference between macOS and Windows? Which is better?\nSimply put, macOS is the operating system in all of Apple's notebooks and desktops, while Windows powers the vast majority of PCs. You'll also find Chromebooks running Google's ChromeOS, but those are basically just web browsers running on top of Linux.\nDebating the differences between Windows and Macs is something PC nerds have been doing since the '80s, so we won't be declaring a winner here. There are some small, negligible distinctions, like using a Command versus a Control key, how file explorers work and concerns about viruses and security. For the most part, those are minor issues or have become moot thanks to better built-in security.\nBut if you care more about playing the newest games, you'll want to have a Windows system. If you're more focused on creative apps, like Photoshop, Premiere and Final Cut Pro, then macOS may be a better fit (especially if you're running an iPhone).\nWhat are the best laptop brands?\nThere is no single \"best\" laptop brand, but judging from this guide alone, we're generally impressed by notebooks from Apple, Dell and ASUS.

    "full_text": "Windows systems offer a range of configurations, from budget to high-end UHD screens with stunning IPS panels that boast high nits for vivid brightness. Both MacBook Air models lasted for well over 18 hours in our tests, so they’ll likely last you two work days without needing to be juiced up. And while they’re far from gaming PCs, we were still impressed to see them run the graphically intensive game Lies of P at 60fps in 1080p. Thanks to manufacturing advancements, these dainty machines sometimes even come with larger screens (the smaller MacBook Air actually has a 13.6-inch display). They typically weigh between 3.5 and 4.5 pounds, but that extra heft may be worth it to fit wider video editing timelines or Photoshop windows. Intel's older 13th-gen and 12th-gen laptop chips also don't have NPUs, so keep that in mind if you're looking at used systems. Those CPUs mainly target gaming laptops and high performance systems, while you'll still find AMD’s older Ryzen 7000 chips in ultraportables. While many factors go into NPU performance, for the most part we measure their potential speed by TOPS (tera operations per second). AMD also announced its Ryzen 8040 AI mobile chips that month (and it couldn't help but say they were faster than Intel's new hardware). Most of that will be taken up by the operating system, and you’ll likely run into issues cramming in large apps after a few months."

    "full_text": "The Browser Company has launched a Pro subscription plan for Dia, its new web browser that heavily integrates AI features. The introduction of a paid tier means free users will now face usage limits on AI features. While The Browser Company hasn’t specified exact limits, CEO Josh Miller told The New York Times in July that the browser will remain free for those who use AI features “a few times a week.” Miller also indicated that the startup plans to offer multiple subscription tiers, ranging from $5 per month to hundreds of dollars monthly. The current $20 plan appears to be one of several options based on different feature sets. Earlier this week, users on Reddit and Threads noticed that The Browser Company had quietly made the Pro plan available online. Now the subscription option has been restored and can be accessed through Dia’s settings page. This Pro plan represents the company’s first revenue-generating subscription service. The startup faces growing competition when it comes to AI-enhanced browsers. Perplexity’s Comet browser is gaining steam, Opera is also prepping its Neon browser, and incumbents like Google and Microsoft are also integrating their AI assistants into their browsers."

According to reports citing local authorities, Coristine — who left DOGE in June but quickly returned to federal service at the Social Security Administration to help improve the agency’s website — was with a female friend around 3 a.m. Sunday in Washington’s Logan Circle when a circle of roughly 10 teens approached their car and made comments about taking it. He reportedly pushed the woman into the car for her safety before confronting the mob, which then attacked him until police drove up, called to the scene by Coristine’s companion, who’d phoned 911. On Tuesday, Musk praised Coristine for his bravery on his social media platform, X. President Trump separately shared an image of a battered Coristine on Truth Social, using the assault to call for prosecuting teens as young as 14 as adults, and for “federalizing” Washington."

    "summary": "Apple plans to invest an additional $100 billion in the US, the company announced on Wednesday. The investment follows President Donald's Trump's announcement yesterday that he would impose a 100 percent tariff on chip imports, with an exemption for any companies \"building in the United States.\" \nAlso relevant is the White House's previously announced plans to raise tariffs on India by an additional 25 percent (bringing the total tariff to 50 percent) for purchasing oil from Russia. Apple relies heavily on manufacturers in India to create the iPhone, so adding to its already $500 billion investment in the US is likely a way to avoid being impacted by the tariffs.\n\"Today, we're proud to increase our investments across the United States to $600 billion over four years and launch our new American Manufacturing Program,\" Apple CEO Tim Cook shared in a statement. \"This includes new and expanded work with 10 companies across America. They produce components that are used in Apple products sold all over the world, and we’re grateful to the President for his support.\"\nApple is expanding our US commitment to $600 billion over the next four years. And our new American Manufacturing Program will bring even more jobs and advanced manufacturing to the US. pic.twitter.com/6KWkTGJN3O— Tim Cook (@tim_cook) August 6, 2025\n\nIn February, Apple said its original $500 billion investment plan would go towards building Apple Intelligence servers in the US, and that the majority of the new jobs the funding would provide would be focused on R&D, silicon engineering, software development and AI and machine learning. As part of this additional investment, Apple says it's also deepening its relationship and investment in component makers working in the US, like Corning and Amkor. \nCorning produces the glass for iPhones and Apple Watches, and the company says that \"soon, every iPhone and Apple Watch sold around the world will be built with Kentucky-made cover glass.\" Apple is investing in Amkor to take advantage of the company's \"advanced chip packaging and test facility in Arizona.\" Apple says its \"leading the creation of an end-to-end silicon supply chain in the United States\" through its investments.\nIn addition, Apple said it would be working with Samsung \"to launch an innovative new technology for making chips, which has never been used before anywhere in the world.\" Those chips will reportedly be cutting-edge image sensors for iPhone cameras and be built in Texas, according to The Financial Times. Apple may be shifting at least part of its sensor purchases to Samsung from Sony due to tariffs — Samsung has chip plants in the US and Sony doesn't. Apple said that Texas Instruments, Broadcom and GlobalFoundries would expand component manufacturing in the US as well. \nIn a statement to Bloomberg before the announcement, a White House spokesperson suggested the new investment would \"help reshore the production of critical components to protect America’s economic and national security.\" The Trump administration has previously called for Apple to make the iPhone in the US, something CNN reports is difficult to downright impossible.\nApple's current strategy for dealing with Trump is similar to how it handled the President during his first term. In 2019, Cook and Trump \"opened\" a Mac Pro factory in Texas. The factory had been up-and-running since 2013, but the President was pleased by the optics of making a deal. Apple's partnership with Amkor was similarly announced years ago in 2023, but is being trotted out now because it fits with Apple's \"American Manufacturing Program.\"\nApple is a trillion-dollar company that can afford to spend a few billion to avoid paying tariffs, but it also likely planned to increase its investment in the US anyway to keep up with competitors. It's entirely possible the company is just packaging its spending in a way that flatters the President. \nSteve Dent contributed to this report.

    "summary": "\nYour iPhone's operating system is getting a big upgrade this fall with the release of iOS 26. One of the better changes — and also Apple's largest visual update in years — is the new Liquid Glass design (think Windows Vista, but arguably more thoughtful). We spent two weeks test-driving it — you can check out our detailed hands-on iOS 26 preview, or you can try it out yourself by downloading and installing the public beta. That software is a more stable iteration of the separate developer version, which recently hit the beta 5 waypoint, and offers a few more flashy features not yet available in the public version. (While the public beta is open to everyone and quite stable, always remember there's a degree of risk involved with beta software.) Not ready to upgrade your smartphone this year? No worries, we'll help you find out if your phone will be able to run iOS 26.\nWhile Apple didn't nix any iPhones from its eligibility list last year, that's not the case for 2025 — a few models are getting cut this time. All iPhone 8 models and the iPhone X were the last to get the boot in 2023, and this year the 2018 models are getting left behind. If you have an ineligible device, you won't be able to download iOS 26 when it becomes available this fall.\nWe'll get to the bottom of which iPhones will support iOS 26 this year. To see what's coming with the latest OS and more, check out everything announced at Apple's WWDC June 9 event. One thing you shouldn't immediately expect is Apple's updated version of Siri, though the company is reportedly working on a 'stripped-down' AI chatbot to compete with ChatGPT.\nThese three iPhones won't be compatible with iOS 26\nUnlike last year, several iPhone models won't be eligible to download the newest iOS when it makes its debut this fall. This trio of models first released in 2018 won't be coming to the iOS 26 party:\n\niPhone XR\niPhone XS\niPhone XS Max\n\niPhones compatible with iOS 26\nWhile we don't yet know the new iPhones Apple will be dropping this fall — though there are iPhone 17 rumors — we do know, per Apple's site, that the phones listed below will be compatible with iOS 26. Basically, if you have an iPhone that was announced in 2019 or later, you're in the clear:\n\niPhone SE (second generation or later)\niPhone 11\niPhone 11 Pro\niPhone 11 Pro Max\niPhone 12\niPhone 12 mini\niPhone 12 Pro\niPhone 12 Pro Max\niPhone 13\niPhone 13 mini\niPhone 13 Pro\niPhone 13 Pro Max\niPhone 14\niPhone 14 Plus\niPhone 14 Pro\niPhone 14 Pro Max\niPhone 15\niPhone 15 Plus\niPhone 15 Pro\niPhone 15 Pro Max\niPhone 16e\niPhone 16\niPhone 16 Plus\niPhone 16 Pro\niPhone 16 Pro Max\n\nWhat if I don't want to buy a new iPhone?\nIf you want to continue using your older iPhone that isn't supported by iOS 26, that's fine. However, you'll miss out on security updates which could potentially put your phone at risk for malware and other threats. Additionally, some apps may stop working if they require a certain version of iOS or later. And of course, you won't be able to access the latest features iOS 26 offers.\nWhen will iOS 26 become available?\nApple usually rolls out its latest iOS in mid-September, just a few days before the new iPhones hit store shelves. Last year, it released iOS 18 on Monday, Sept. 16. Expect a confirmation of the release date at the iPhone 17 event, expected in early September. \niOS 26 features we're excited about\nLiquid Glass design: Your home screen is getting revamped with new app icons, including dark mode and all-clear options. You'll also notice buttons with a new floating design. Liquid Glass was designed to make all of Apple's OSes more cohesive.\nPhone app redesign: You'll finally be able to scroll through contacts, recent calls and voicemail messages all on one screen. It also comes with a new feature called Hold Assist that'll notify you when an agent comes to the phone so you can avoid the elevator music.\nLive Translate: iOS 26 is bringing the ability to have a conversation via phone call or text message with someone who speaks another language. Live Translate will translate your conversation in real time. \nPolls feature: Coming to group messages in the Messages app, chat members will be able to create polls. This can help prevent the unwanted 30+ messages when it comes to deciding which restaurant you're meeting at this weekend.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/can-you-download-the-ios-26-beta-today-heres-a-comprehensive-list-of-all-compatible-iphones-191854920.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Liquid Glass is a huge new change coming to iOS 26. (Apple)\nThe wait for upgrading your iPhone to iOS 26 keeps getting shorter, but we're still over a month out from the release, which is expected this fall. But if you want to start testing out the new features today, you can download and install Apple's public beta, which CEO Tim Cook recently said is (along with the other current beta operating systems) \"by far the most popular developer betas we’ve had,\" 9to5Mac reports. You can also take a look at our preview of the iOS 26 public beta release, which shows off the fresh home and lock screen redesign. Called Liquid Glass, the new translucent look will extend across all of Apple's upcoming operating systems. The overhaul is one of several big changes coming to iOS, macOS, iPadOS and the rest of Apple's software suite, all of which were showcased during the company's WWDC keynote on June 9. \nAfter overpromising on AI plans last year, Apple kept its iOS roadmap focused more on basic quality of life improvements this year. There are multiple useful additions coming to the Phone and Messages apps on your iPhone, for instance: Apple execs outlined the ability to weed out spam texts or other unknown senders and an option to hold your spot on a phone call when you've been waiting for a representative to pick up. Plus, a treasured feature that we took for granted is coming back (hint: it's in the Photos app).\nSiri, meanwhile, is in a holding pattern. Apple has previously specified that its smarter voice assistant — first promised at WWDC 2024 — is delayed until some point \"in the coming year,\" so you shouldn't expect any major changes in the current betas. But there are reports that Apple is aiming to give Siri a bigger brain transplant by basing it on third-party artificial intelligence models like OpenAI's ChatGPT or Anthropic's Claude, which could make 2026 a pivotal year. The company is also reportedly working on a 'stripped-down' AI chatbot to rival ChatGPT.\nWith each beta, it seems like additional new improvements are popping up, like this FaceTime feature that'll freeze your video if it detects nudity. Now that iOS 26 developer beta 5 is available, we're seeing more added features, like a new bouncy animation on the passcode screen and in the Control Center, MacRumors reports. Some or all of those changes will likely soon migrate into the separate public beta (see below). Most newer iPhone models are eligible to download iOS 26 (both the betas and final version). Want to see the full list of new features coming this fall? Read on.  \nWhat is iOS 26?\nThe current iPhone operating system is iOS 18, and Apple is still actively updating it — version 18.6 was just recently released. But don't expect to see iOS 19. Instead, Apple is skipping the numbering ahead to iOS 26 later this year. The company has decided to line up its iOS version numbers with a year-based system, similar to car model years. So while iOS and its sibling operating systems will be released in late 2025, they're all designated \"26\" to reflect the year ahead. (Meanwhile, iOS 18 is still getting new versions this summer, too.)\nIt's official, we're moving to iOS 26. (Apple)\nWhat is Liquid Glass design?\nLet's be honest. Out of everything announced at WWDC this year, the new Liquid Glass design was the star of the show. The iPhone's home and lock screens have looked pretty much the same year after year — the last exciting thing (in my opinion) was the option to add your own aesthetic to your home screen by customizing your apps and widgets. So seeing the home and lock screens' new facelift is refreshing.\nSo what exactly is Liquid Glass? Apple calls it a \"new translucent material\" since, well, the apps and widgets are clear. However, the screen can still adapt to dark and light modes, depending on surroundings. You'll also notice buttons with a new floating design in several apps, like Phone and Maps. They're designed to be less distracting than the current buttons, but are still easy to see. While the design overhaul has proven to be controversial since its announcement, some — including Engadget's own Devindra Hardawar — like the new direction, even if it's somewhat reminiscent of Microsoft's translucent Windows Vista Aero designs from nearly twenty years ago.\nThat said, as of the release of the iOS 26 beta 2, Apple has already incorporated some user feedback into the design, dialing back the transparency in at least some places. And while it will continue to evolve, Apple users won't be able to escape it: Liquid Glass was designed to make all of Apple's OSes more cohesive. Here's a look at how the translucent aesthetic will look with the new macOS Tahoe 26 on your desktop.\nWhat are the new and notable features of iOS 26?\niOS 26 has a laundry list of new features. Among the most worthwhile:\nPhone app redesign: You'll finally be able to scroll through contacts, recent calls and voicemail messages all on one screen. It also comes with a new feature called Hold Assist that'll notify you when an agent comes to the phone so you can avoid the elevator music and continue on with other tasks.\nLive Translation in Phone, FaceTime and Messages: iOS 26 is bringing the ability to have a conversation via phone call or text message with someone who speaks another language. Live Translation will translate your conversation in real time, which results in some stop-and-go interactions in the examples Apple shared during its presentation.\nPolls in group chats: Tired of sorting through what seems like hundreds of messages in your group chat? You and your friends will soon be able to create polls in group messages for deciding things like which brunch spot you're eating at or whose car you're taking on a road trip.\nFiltering unknown senders in Messages: If you haven't received spam texts about unpaid tolls or other citations, you're lucky. For those of us who have, those annoying messages will soon be filtered away in a separate folder.\nVisual Intelligence: Similar to a reverse Google image search, this new feature will allow you to search for anything that's on your iPhone screen. For instance, if you spot a pair of shoes someone is wearing in an Instagram photo, you can screenshot it and use Visual Intelligence to find those shoes (or similar ones) online.\nPhotos tabs are back: For anyone who's still frustrated with the Photos changes made last year, you'll be happy to know that your tabs are coming back. Library and Collections will have their own separate spaces so you don't have to scroll to infinity to find what you're looking for.\nFaceTime \"Communication Safety\" feature: A newer addition to iOS 26 appears to be the FaceTime \"Communication Safety\" feature that pauses communications if and when nudity is detected. The feature appears to be a child safety feature that uses on-device detection, thus obviating any cloud-based privacy issues. \nApple's Hold Assist will be nifty for those pesky services that put you on hold for 10 or more minutes. (Apple)\nWhich iPhones will be able to upgrade to iOS 26?\nA few iPhone models that run the current version of iOS — iPhone XR, XS and XS Max — won't be compatible with the latest upgrade. But any iPhones released in 2019 or later will be eligible for the iOS 26 update.\n\niPhone SE (second generation or later)\niPhone 11\niPhone 11 Pro\niPhone 11 Pro Max\niPhone 12\niPhone 12 mini\niPhone 12 Pro\niPhone 12 Pro Max\niPhone 13\niPhone 13 mini\niPhone 13 Pro\niPhone 13 Pro Max\niPhone 14\niPhone 14 Plus\niPhone 14 Pro\niPhone 14 Pro Max\niPhone 15\niPhone 15 Plus\niPhone 15 Pro\niPhone 15 Pro Max\niPhone 16e\niPhone 16\niPhone 16 Plus\niPhone 16 Pro\niPhone 16 Pro Max\n\nNot listed here are the presumed new iPhone 17 models (or maybe iPhone 26?) that are all but certain to be announced and released in September. \nHow to install iOS 26 beta\nThe iOS 26 public beta is now available to download via the Apple Beta Software Program. If you're not already a member, you'll need to sign up to try out all the latest features. Just visit beta.apple.com and sign up with your phone number or email address. It's free.\nOnce you're in, you can install it by going to Settings > General > Software Update and selecting iOS 26 public beta. \nA word of caution: Don't sign up with your main iPhone unless you're OK with any risks that occur with using an OS that isn't finalized.\nWhen will the final version of iOS 26 be released?\niOS 26 will be released to the public this fall. It usually comes in September, within a week of the Apple iPhone event. Last year, it rolled out to iPhone users on September 16 — exactly one week after the iPhone 16 lineup was announced.\nIf you're more interested in the Apple Intelligence features coming, here's everything Apple revealed for iOS, macOS and more during WWDC.

    "summary": "We already know the changes coming to our phones with iOS 26, but we're super excited to see what Apple's newest iPhone 17 lineup will look like. That's still more than a month away — assuming Apple sticks to its usual release schedule — so for now we can speculate what the new phones will look like. As with most unreleased iPhone models, rumors and leaks have trickled in about the hardware side ahead of the official introduction. Here's what we're expecting and what we can reasonably assume we'll get from Cupertino in September.\nWhat are the latest iPhone 17 rumors and reports?\nSurprisingly, the latest rumor isn't about the actual iPhone 17 details themselves, but rather when they'll finally be showcased. MacRumors highlighted a story originally reported by iphone-ticker.de that the Apple iPhone 17 event could be Tuesday, September 9, according to information gleaned from German mobile phone providers. \nWhile the iPhone events typically take place around the second week of September, we won't know the actual date until Apple makes the official announcement.\nWhen will the iPhone 17 series be announced?\nMost years, the flagship smartphones are introduced in September. It's a little early to have the specific dates; some years, Apple only gives a week or two of lead time between sending invites and hosting the event. But years of past precedent show that sometime in September should be when the 17 models make their debut. This family of smartphones may be the last to follow that trend, however. There have been hints that the introduction of the iPhone 18 collection in 2026 will be split into a pro-tier announcement in the fall and a standard model announcement the following spring.\nWhat will the new iPhone 17 lineup include?\nDesign leaks suggest that Apple is building an ultra-thin smartphone, likely to be named the iPhone 17 Air to match Apple's ultralight laptop designation. Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, often a solid source of advanced intel about Apple, reported in January that the iPhone 17 Air will be equipped with a basic A19 chip and will only have a single camera lens. It may also use Apple's new in-house modem, which was introduced in February on the iPhone 16e. More details about this development may leak ahead of September, but that's what we know for now.\nAn investor note from Apple analyst Jeff Pu indicated that the Air will have a titanium frame. If his reports are accurate, the lightweight smartphone will be the only entry in the iPhone 17 lineup to use that metal; the iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone 17 Pro Max are expected to be made of aluminum, which is oddly a lighter material than titanium. Other speculation had suggested that the Air would use a blend of aluminum and titanium, so the exact materials may not be known until the official announcement.\nAdditionally, an August 4 MacRumors report says the internal battery pack of the iPhone Air is just 2.49mm thick — half the thickness of the iPhone 17 Pro battery. The leak was posted on the Korean-langauge Naver blog, where they show the alleged batteries of the iPhone 17 Air and 17 Pro side by side. The same account claimed the 17 Air's battery capacity was a mere 2,800 mAh, MacRumors notes. (That's below the battery capacity of current iPhone 16 models.)\nEach new roster includes a base model, but over the years, Apple has shaken up the variety of phones it offers. Most likely there will be an iPhone 17 and an iPhone 17 Pro. Apple has also committed to the size matters philosophy, and has been building an iPhone Pro Max option with an even bigger screen and better battery life; the 17 roster will almost certainly have one as well. \nThe new Pro iPhones are said to have a full-width \"camera island\" on the rear, which would mark the first time an Apple model opted for that design. This feature can be seen in the purported iPhone 17 \"spotted in the wild.\" The pics, highlighted on MacRumors, show a black cased iPhone (17 Pro?) with the distinct back panel. Is it the real deal? The dual angles lend a degree of credibility in a social media landscape increasingly polluted with AI-enhanced fakes, but your guess is as good as ours.\nI just spotted a test development iPhone in the wild 🤩🤩🤩 pic.twitter.com/iS3PtKWqxJ— Fox Pupy 🦊🧡 (@Skyfops) July 28, 2025\n\nThe iPhone 17 Air seems primed to take the place of a potential iPhone 17 Plus. Since the iPhone 16e was only just introduced in February at a surprisingly high price point, it seems unlikely that there will be a new addition to that lower end of the spectrum, the models that were previously called SE. \nAt the very least, it sounds like the iPhone 17 Air won't take away the charging port and rely only on wireless connectivity. Bloomberg said that while Apple had investigated making the iPhone 17 Air without a single port, the company (fortunately) changed plans. He also says that the rumored phone will have a 6.6-inch screen and include the Dynamic Island and Camera Control button. Finally, the price is rumored at $900 — likely more than the standard iPhone 17 but less than the Pro.\nWe've also gotten what seems to be a reliable look at what the color lineup will be for the new smartphones. Macworld reported that the iPhone 17 will be available in black, white, steel gray, green, purple and light blue. The iPhone 17 Air will reportedly have four color options: black, white, light blue and light gold. While the Air colors will be less saturated, the visuals for the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max will go bold. The options for the Pro models are expected to be black, white, gray, dark blue and orange.\nOn July 30, Tom's Guide highlighted an X post from Sonny Dickson — a longtime and generally reliable leaker of unreleased iPhone information — showing \"dummy\" iPhone 17 models in the new colors that were the source of the aforementioned Macworld story. While these are literally just mock-ups — not real, leaked iPhones — it's interesting to see how the design and color rumors translate into a real-world look and feel.\nWhat will iOS 26 be like?\nApple upended its numbering conventions with WWDC 2025, and will match the name of each new operating system to the year it's released. So when the next wave of iPhones hits, they'll be running on iOS 26.\nOn the design side, the smartphone OS introduced during the big developer showcase took a contentious approach dubbed Liquid Glass. Apple has been scaling down the amount of transparency effects in the subsequent beta tests of iOS 26, but it will still have a glass-like visual.\nThe feature list includes big and small updates. On the more impactful side, the Phone and Photos apps have been redesigned. There will be several features leveraging artificial intelligence, such as live translation capabilities coming to Phone, FaceTime and Messages. Apple is also currently testing a sensitive content warning for child accounts that will freeze FaceTime video if nudity is detected by on-device machine learning tools. And the company is also launching Visual Intelligence, which will use AI to search for elements in an image.\niOS 26 also has a litany of minor, quality of life improvements. Group texts are getting support for polls. And for the slow risers out there, iOS 26 will finally let you escape the tyranny of the nine minute snooze alarm. \nThe next iOS is now available as a public beta. Here are our initial impressions of the Liquid Glass design and other new features. iOS 26 is compatible with all models back through iPhone 11.\nUpdate, August 6, 2025, 4:05PM ET: Added latest details about the potential iPhone 17 event date.\nUpdate, August 4, 2025, 5:23PM ET: Added latest battery leaks about the iPhone 17 models.\nUpdate, August 1, 2025, 8:15AM ET: Added new photos showing potential iPhone 17 colors.\nUpdate, July 30, 2025, 11:08AM ET: Added latest leaks and rumors about the iPhone 17, and updated information on the iOS 26 public beta.\nUpdate, July 17, 2025, 4:40PM ET: Added latest information about iOS 26, possible materials for the Air, and the color options for the different models.\nUpdate, March 17, 2025, 2PM ET: Added details about the rumored price and features of the iPhone 17 Air.\nUpdate, April 11, 2025, 3:45PM ET: Added details from Front Page Tech's new video that claims to reveal details from a leaked iOS 19 build.\nKatie Teague contributed to this story.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/apple-iphone-17-event-release-date-launch-date-colors-and-everything-else-you-need-to-know-153024258.html?src=rss",

    "full_text": "But Google on Wednesday denied that’s the case, at least in aggregate. Instead, the search giant says that total organic click volume from its search engine to websites has been “relatively stable” year-over-year and that average click quality has slightly increased. That word “some” is doing heavy lifting here, as Google doesn’t share data about how many sites are gaining or losing. Google also allows users to interact with an AI chatbot for some queries. (Google denies this, telling us that Reid’s commentary is only reflective of trends it’s seeing in traffic to sites from Google.) Back in 2022, a Google exec even said that social sites like TikTok and Instagram were eating into Google’s core products, like Search and Maps. Google has also long been worried that Amazon.com had become people’s first stop for online shopping searches, and Reddit.com had become the first stop for researching topics of interest. The company only points out that when people click through on an AI response to the source, they’re more likely to dive deeper, so those clicks are more valuable. One recent study from Similarweb indicates that the number of news searches on the web resulting in zero clicks to news websites has grown from 56% (when Google launched AI Overviews in May 2024) to 69% as of May 2025. It’s as if Google wants publishers to believe not what their own eyes — and graphs and charts — tell them, but instead take comfort in the fact that Google still sends “billions of clicks to websites” every day, just as the post claims."

This was primarily based on the item's superior suction power, especially when compared to rival units.

We also never got any alerts that the robot got stuck somewhere while working.\nThe bin here is on the larger side, but this unit is missing some key features found with other pricey robot vacuums. This is a really good vacuum and nothing else. It's not a hybrid unit, so there's no mopping functionality.

    "summary": "Key sections of the US Constitution were temporarily removed from Congress' website. Provisions including habeas corpus (due process) and the prohibition of nobility titles (like, say, King) vanished from the digital version of the document. They've since been restored. 404 Media first reported on the edits after users on Lemmy forums spotted them.\nThere are many ways to read a copy of the US Constitution. But the Library of Congress' online version is one of the easiest to find. Alongside its counterpart hosted by the National Archives, it's an official digital communication from the government. Those two websites also sit atop Google's search results for \"US Constitution.\"\nSo, when key sections vanish from the website, it's worth noting. And when they coincide with those that the Trump administration has said it wants to remove, it's a bit more eyebrow-raising.\nPortions of Section 8 of Article I, along with all of Sections 9 and 10 of Article I, were missing. \"The Privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended\" was part of that. Also gone was \"No Title of Nobility shall be granted by the United States.\" Ditto for the provision banning foreign emoluments for US officials.\nThe Lemmy thread that first caught the changes includes the complete list of edits. The National Archives version wasn't edited.\n404 Media notes that, before these edits, the website hadn't changed significantly since first being archived by the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine. (That archive goes back to 2019.) The US Constitution hasn't changed since 1992.\nBluesky\nThe Library of Congress said it was a mistake. \"It has been brought to our attention that some sections of Article 1 are missing from the Constitution Annotated (constitution.congress.gov) website,\" the official account posted on Bluesky. \"We've learned that this is due to a coding error. We have been working to correct this and expect it to be resolved soon.\" It was changed back sometime around 2PM ET on Wednesday.\nThe Trump administration doesn't have official control over the Library of Congress, which runs the website. But in May, the president fired Librarian of Congress Carla Hayden. (White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt claimed she \"did not fit the needs of the American people.\") Trump then named Todd Blanche, one of his former defense lawyers, as acting Librarian of Congress. The Senate must confirm a permanent replacement.\nThis isn't the first time official government websites have removed text that the Trump administration finds inconvenient. In March, The NY Times listed hundreds of words the administration removed from public-facing websites and other materials. They include terms like \"activism,\" \"disability,\" \"equality,\" \"female,\" \"prejudice,\" \"pollution,\" \"racism,\" \"sex,\" \"transgender\" and \"women.\" (\"Men\" wasn't on the list of banned words.)\nOf course, deleting text from the website doesn't change the legally binding document. (\"You realize that they still exist even if you don't post them, right?\" Jehosaphat Q. Blatte snarked on Bluesky.) But given the current state of affairs, you may want to look elsewhere to bone up on your rights.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/sections-on-habeas-corpus-and-nobility-titles-were-temporarily-removed-from-congress-us-constitution-website-182956441.html?src=rss",

When it's toggled on, Gemini will treat questions as more of a conversation, testing your knowledge, explaining concepts and even generating visual aids, Google says. The feature is powered by Google's LearnLM, a collection of models \"fine-tuned for learning and grounded in educational research.\"\nGoogle\nOn top of Guided Learning, Google is also offering a free year of its AI Pro plan for college students in the US, Japan, Indonesia, Korea and Brazil. Google technically announced this promotion back in April for its Google One AI Premium plan, but given the pace of AI and the never-ending complexity of Google's branding, Google One AI Premium is now called Google AI Pro. The subscription unlocks access to Gemini across Google Workspace apps, increases the amount of files you can upload to NotebookLM and Gemini 2.5 Pro and includes 2TB of storage. The subscription normally costs $200 per year, so the savings are meaningful, even for just the storage.\nGoogle has made deep inroads into education with Chromebooks and Google Workspace, so it makes sense that it would try and leverage that good will to create multiple generations of AI-dependent users. Besides the new feature and promotion, the company says it's also investing \"$1 billion in funding over three years for American education\" to cover things like research, cloud computing resources and AI literacy courses.

    "summary": "After largely focusing Google I/O 2025 on the ways the company wants Gemini to change everything from searching the web to filmmaking, Google is finally ready to launch new hardware. The next Made by Google event is on the books for August 20, and Google has already confirmed what at least one of its new Pixel 10 phones will look like.\nGoogle remains as leak-prone as ever, so nearly all the new hardware the company is expected to announce has all ready been reported on in one form or another. With that in mind and after sifting through what has leaked, here's what Google will show off at the Pixel 10 launch even in New York City on August 20.\nPixel 10, 10 Pro, 10 Pro XL and 10 Pro Fold\nAndroid Headlines / Onleaks \nGoogle's invitation for the event says that the company is sharing \"the latest on our Pixel phones, watches, buds and more,” which more or less confirms the company will introduce a slate of products that's similar to what it launched in 2024. That means a Pixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro, Pixel 10 Pro XL and Pixel 10 Pro Fold are absolutely on the menu.\nGoogle's tease of the Pixel 10 confirmed what leaked renders have already signaled: the company isn't abandoning the new design language the Pixel 9 established. The pill-shaped camera bump and flat front display will still be present on the Pixel 10, and the real changes will be in the details, like for example, how the flat sides of the Pixel 10 join with the phone's back.\nThose subtle changes will apparently also include the thickness of the Pixel 10s. While both the Pixel 10, 10 Pro, 10 Pro XL and 10 Pro Fold will use the same sized OLED screens as their Pixel 9 counterparts, they'll be housed in thicker and heavier bodies, according to Android Headlines. Google's new Pixels are also supposed to come in new colors. The Pixel 10 will come in \"Frost\" (a royal blue), \"Lemongrass\" (a yellow), \"Indigo\" (a light purple) and \"Obsidian\" (a dark gray), while the Pixel 10 Pro / Pro XL will come in Obsidian, \"Porcelain\" (off-white), \"Moonstone\" (a bluish gray) and \"Jade\" (a light green). Less information is known about the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, though recent leaks suggest it'll come in Moonstone and Jade, as well.\nAndroid Headlines\nThe most visible external change that'll be introduced on the Pixel 10 is the addition of a new telephoto camera. The new telephoto camera is a 11-megapixel 5x telephoto, Android Authority reports, similar to the one on the Pixel 9 Pro Fold. Meanwhile, the Pixel 10 Pro and 10 Pro XL are expected to feature a 50-megapixel wide, 48-megapixel ultrawide, 48-megapixel telephoto and 48-megapixel selfie cameras. The Pixel 10 Pro Fold could feature a different lineup, with a similar main camera, but 12-megapixel ultrawide and telephoto cameras, and 11-megapixel selfie cameras.\nInside the new phones, Google is laying the groundwork for future performance gains with a new Tensor G5 chip. It's likely be much more power-efficient thanks to the company switching to a 3nm design produced by TSMC. Reports suggest the chip might not be all that different in terms of raw power, but the Tensor G5 is likely designed to be extra capable when it comes to using local AI features.\nAs far as timing goes, it's worth noting that the latest rumors indicate that the Pixel 10, 10 Pro and 10 Pro XL will be available about a week after the event, on August 28. But the Pixel 10 Pro Fold (as well as the Pixel Watch 4 and Pixel Buds 2a aren't expected for more than a month after that. Those devices are rumored to be on sale as of October 9.\nWhile global tariff turmoil could justify a price increase, Google is reportedly keeping things consistent with the Pixel 10 family. They'll offer similar storage options, come in at the same prices and include the same freebies and incentives. The Pixel 10 will come with six months of Google AI Pro and Fitbit Premium, along with three months of YouTube Premium. Meanwhile the Pixel 10 Pro models will get a year of Google AI Pro, six months of Fitbit Premium and three months of YouTube Premium. The prices and storage options for the phones should breakout down as follows:\n\nPixel 10: 128GB ($799), 256GB ($899)\nPixel 10 Pro: 128GB ($999), 256GB ($1,099), 512GB ($1,219), 1TB ($1,449)\nPixel 10 Pro XL: 256GB ($1,199), 512GB ($1,319), 1TB ($1,549)\nPixel 10 Pro Fold: 256GB ($1,799), 512GB ($1,919), 1TB ($2,149)\n\nPixel Watch 4\n91mobiles / Onleaks\nThe third time was the charm for the Pixel Watch 3, so the main task Google has with the Pixel Watch 4 is to not squander the solid base it already has. Leaks for the company's new smartwatches have been limited so far, but renders of the Pixel Watch 4 shared by 91mobiles do suggest Google has a few changes planned.\nNamely, much like the company's phones, the new Pixel Watch seems like it'll be a little bit thicker and come with smaller bezels. The Pixel Watch 4 should be available to purchase in the same 41mm and 45mm sizes as before, but in new colors — including a Moonstone option to match the Pixel 10 — and with a brighter display.\nThe thicker frame will also help the smartwatch fit a larger battery and a new wireless charging system, according to Android Headlines. Rather than charge through a puck with pogo pins like the Pixel Watch 3, the Pixel Watch 4 will use a wireless charging stand that could fill it up even faster.\nBeyond that, Google has already indicated how Wear OS is evolving. The new Wear OS 6 update is debuting on the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8, and will presumably be available on the Pixel Watch 4 at launch. It includes built-in access to Gemini, among other tweaks. Given Google also manages the Fitbit Premium subscription, it wouldn't be all that surprising if the Pixel Watch 4 gets some exclusive fitness tracking features, too.\nPixel Buds 2a\nBilly Steele for Engadget\nGoogle launched the Pixel Buds Pro 2 last year, and it typically doesn't update its premium earbuds on a yearly cadence. So instead, Tom's Guide reports Google might pair the Pixel 10 with the Pixel Buds Pro 2 in a new color, and save its new hardware announcements for a sequel to the Pixel Buds A-series called the Pixel Buds 2a.\nUnlike the company's premium wireless earbuds, the A-series Pixel Buds have historically skimped on things like active noise cancellation to hit a lower price. There's little reporting on where Google will take the Pixel Buds 2a, but you can expect the new earbuds to come in some of the new colors being introduced on the Pixel 10.\nPixelsnap\nThe Qi2 wireless charging standard is available for all phone makers to use, but it hasn't been widely adopted among Android phone makers. Qi2 uses magnets to offer improved charging speeds, just like Apple's MagSafe, and the Pixel 10 could mark Google's adoption of Qi2 through a new feature called \"Pixelsnap.\"\nA report from Android Authority suggests the Pixel 10 will include the necessary magnets to make Qi2 happen, and will be introduced alongside a lineup of Pixelsnap accessories. New leaked images showing a Pixel 10 charging with a magnetic charging puck that looks a lot like Apple's MagSafe charger adds even more credence to the rumor.\nIf you need even more convincing, the Wireless Power Consortium has announced that its faster Qi2 25W charging is coming to \"major Android phones.\" It would make sense if Google's Pixel 10s were included considering runs Android itself.\nGemini and other exclusive software features\nGemini is Google's current favorite, and the company is pushing the AI assistant everywhere it makes sense. The last few Pixel Drops — Google's regular Pixel-focused software updates — have primarily included Gemini features. It would make sense for Google to include a few more software exclusives on the Pixel 10.\nGoogle is hosting the Pixel 10 launch event on August 20 at 1PM ET / 10AM ET. The company has invited press to attend in person, and you can read coverage of everything Google announces right here on Engadget.\nUpdate, August 6, 12:15PM ET: Added information about the timeline for when Google's new hardware is expected to arrive.\nUpdate, July 30, 2:30PM ET: Added information on pricing for the Pixel 10 lineup and new details on Qi2 support.\nUpdate, July 24, 3:44PM ET: Added details on the Pixel Watch 4's display, new colors and charging stand.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/google-pixel-10-launch-new-phones-foldables-and-watches-at-the-made-by-google-event-214510624.html?src=rss",

Qi2 uses magnets to offer improved charging speeds, just like Apple's MagSafe, and the Pixel 10 could mark Google's adoption of Qi2 through a new feature called \"Pixelsnap.\" If you need even more convincing, the Wireless Power Consortium has announced that its faster Qi2 25W charging is coming to \"major Android phones.\" It would make sense if Google's Pixel 10s were included considering runs Android itself. It would make sense for Google to include a few more software exclusives on the Pixel 10. The company has invited press to attend in person, and you can read coverage of everything Google announces right here on Engadget."

The report suggests that the country has been shuttling these recordings to Microsoft Azure cloud servers.\nCompany CEO Satya Nadella allegedly okayed the effort personally after meeting with a commander from Israel’s military surveillance agency, Unit 8200. He reportedly gave the country a customized and segregated area within the Azure platform to store millions of phone calls made each day without knowledge or consent from Palestinians.\nAccording to sources within Unit 8200, these recordings have assisted in the preparation of deadly airstrikes and helped shape military operations throughout the region. Israel has long been intercepting calls in the occupied territories, as it basically controls the entire Palestinian telecommunications infrastructure.\nThis new method, however, reportedly captures the conversations of a large pool of regular civilians. The mantra when building out the project was to record \"a million calls an hour.\" Leaked Microsoft files suggest that the lion's share of this data is being stored in Azure facilities in the Netherlands and Ireland.\nMicrosoft has been facing increased scrutiny regarding its role in Israel's 22-month offensive in Gaza. CEO Nadella was interrupted by an employee at a keynote speech in May, with the worker pleading for the executive to \"show how Israeli war crimes are powered by Azure.\"\n🎮 Microsoft workers are refusing to work on Israeli military tech.

Today's reporting suggests otherwise. Unit 8200 sources indicate that intelligence drawn from this data was used to identify bombing targets. Microsoft says it has \"no information\" about the kind of data stored by Israel on its servers.\n“At no time during this engagement,” a company representative added, “has Microsoft been aware of the surveillance of civilians or collection of their cellphone conversations using Microsoft’s services, including through the external review it commissioned.” Sources say that usage of the surveillance system increased during the campaign in Gaza. So far, 60,000 people in the territory have been killed, including over 18,000 children.\n\nMicrosoft isn't the only company that has been accused of assisting Israel in what many are calling a genocide in Gaza. A report recently found that Google employees have repeatedly worked with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and Israel’s Defense Ministry (IDM) to expand the government's access to AI tools.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/israel-is-reportedly-storing-millions-of-palestinian-phone-calls-on-microsoft-servers-161127912.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Thirteen years ago, the Curiosity rover landed on Mars, inside Gale crater in particular. It was originally sent to the red planet for a two-year mission, but it was extended indefinitely just a few months into its operations. The rover has several goals, most of which are meant to help scientists determine whether Mars could ever have supported life in the past. And while it's still very much operational and doing science, NASA has had to make adjustments and give it new capabilities to ensure that it can keep running. \nIn a new post celebrating the 13th anniversary of the rover's landing, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory has detailed the updates the Curiosity team has had to implement. To start with, the team manages the rover's daily power budget with great care to make sure it can do its job and last longer. See, Curiosity uses a power system called Multi-Mission Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator (MMRTG), which relies on decaying plutonium pellets to generate energy. As the plutonium decays over time, it takes longer and longer for the system to recharge the rover's battery. \nThat's why the team now meticulously factors in every device that draws on the batteries. They consolidate Curiosity's tasks to shorten the time the rover is active to also reduce the energy used. The ground team, for instance, tells Curiosity to talk to an orbiter while driving or moving its robotic arm instead of doing one task at a time. If the rover finishes its tasks early, it can go to sleep early and recharge for the next day, which JPL says maximizes the life of the MMRTG. \nOver the past years, NASA has also rolled out updates to change how the rover's robotic arm drill collects samples and to improve its driving capabilities. JPL developed an algorithm to reduce wear on the rover's wheels, as well, so they can last longer. \nFrom the time Curiosity had landed on Mars, it has provided us with multiple discoveries and new information. It discovered organic molecules in Martian atmosphere and soil, detected \"startlingly high\" levels of methane that's a gas typically produced by life as we know it, and it found evidence of ancient megafloods on the red planet. And water, as you know, could indicate the presence of life. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/science/space/nasa-explains-how-it-keeps-the-curiosity-rover-running-13-years-later-124530184.html?src=rss",

It's a good deal for anyone who wants to take advantage of the Switch 2's camera functionality in games like Mario Kart World and that recently-released campfire sim.\nThis was designed specifically for Nintendo's new console, so it's a plug-and-play affair. It's actually cheaper than the official Switch 2 camera with this sale and it looks a whole lot cooler. It's a Piranha Plant from the Mario franchise. We called it a \"work of art\" upon encountering the device and that holds true today. \n \nThis thing is not only stylish, resembling an Amiibo more than a camera, but it's downright useful. The pot the Piranha Plant sits in functions as both a stand and USB extension for the device. The plant itself detaches from the pot, so the camera can be used in portable mode by popping it into the USB port at the top of the console.\nThere's also a built-in privacy shutter. Just close the plant's mouth to obscure the lens. The actual camera specs here aren't going to win any awards, with a frame rate of 30FPS and a resolution of 640 x 480p.

It's a good deal for anyone who wants to take advantage of the Switch 2's camera functionality in games like Mario Kart World and that recently-released campfire sim. It's actually cheaper than the official Switch 2 camera with this sale and it looks a whole lot cooler. It's a Piranha Plant from the Mario franchise. We called it a \"work of art\" upon encountering the device and that holds true today. The actual camera specs here aren't going to win any awards, with a frame rate of 30FPS and a resolution of 640 x 480p. However, that's more than enough to capture footage of your floating head to accompany your kart as it races through the Mushroom Kingdom.

    "summary": "Every now and then companies make truly boneheaded decisions, which is exactly what happened when Dell killed off the name of its most iconic PC line and replaced it with something generic. It's like if Ford decided to rebrand Mustang and call it The Prime Sportscar instead. It doesn't make sense. But now that XPS has become Premium, it's time to see if Dell's latest flagship 14-inch ultraportable — the Dell 14 Premium (you see how dumb that sounds?) — still has the DNA that made its predecessors one of the best notebook families for more than a decade.\nDesign and display: How Dell puts the P in Premium\nInstead of doing a full redesign to match its updated name, for 2025 Dell kept the same chassis it used on last year's XPS 14. And I'm not mad at all because it's still one of the most beautiful and elegant notebooks on the market today. Its aluminum chassis has clean lines, a Gorilla Glass 3 surface and just the right amount of ports for a laptop this size: three USB-C slots with Thunderbolt 4, a 3.5mm audio jack and a microSD slot. That's important, because the 14 Premium's smaller sibling — the XPS 13 (which isn’t being renamed yet because it isn't getting updated this year) — doesn't have a headphone jack or a built-in card reader. That said, at between 3.66 and 3.79 pounds depending on which display you pick, the 14 Premium is a touch heavier than some of its similarly-sized rivals like a 14-inch MacBook Pro (3.4 pounds). The difference is small enough that I'm not bothered, though. \n \nThere's also a glass wrist rest with a touchpad that blends invisibly into the deck, which might make it seem potentially hard to use. However, because the tracking area is absolutely massive (it spans the entire area below the spacebar plus the right ALT and Copilot keys), I never felt cramped or like I needed to actively search for my cursor. I also appreciate how Dell found room for speakers on either side of the keyboard.\nOn the other hand, Dell's touch buttons above the number row may be a bit more contentious. I don't mind the ones for adjusting volume and display brightness, but replacing the physical keys for Escape and Delete with the touchscreen options just feels a bit weird. Especially if you ever need to use the classic Windows CTRL + ALT + DEL shortcut and have to press regular keys and touch controls in a single motion. The touch keys also don't turn off when you disable the keyboard's backlight, but at least they're dim enough that they're not distracting.\n\n\n\n\n   Sam Rutherford for Engadget \n \n\nAs for its display, by default the 14 Premium comes with a 14.5-inch 2K 120Hz non-touch IPS display. However, on our review unit, I've been using Dell's optional 3.2K 120Hz touch OLED panel and I must say, it's definitely worth the $200 upcharge. That's because while the OLED screen has slightly lower max brightness (400 nits versus 500 nits for the IPS), its wider color gamut and improved contrast ratio more than make up for that shortcoming.\nPerformance: Not the most up-to-date, but still very versatile\nA base Dell 14 Premium comes with an Intel Core Ultra 7 255H CPU, 16GB of RAM and 512GB of M.2 storage. However, our review unit includes extra memory (32GB), a bigger SSD (1TB) and perhaps most importantly, an optional NVIDIA RTX 4050 GPU.\n\n\n\n\n   Sam Rutherford for Engadget \n \n\nAll told, that's a pretty well-rounded package, as Dell's default config has more than enough performance to handle pretty much any level of regular productivity. And by adding in support for discrete graphics, suddenly you have a machine that's significantly better equipped to take care of more demanding tasks like video editing or even gaming in your off hours. Granted, the 14 Premium's RTX 4050 card is an entry-level component that recently became a generation old, but it was strong enough to hit 60 fps in Cyberpunk 2077 at 1080p on high settings (with DLSS set to balanced), which ain't too shabby considering its portability.\nBattery life: Good enough\n\n\n\n\n   Sam Rutherford for Engadget \n \n\nThe Dell 14 Premium packs good but not outstanding battery life thanks to its 69.5WHr power pack. On PCMark10's Modern Office rundown test, it lasted 8 hours and 30 minutes on the dot That’s significantly longer than ASUS' ROG Z Flow 13 (6:54) and last year's Razer Blade 14 (6:46), but still a far cry from true power-sipping systems like the ASUS Zenbook 14 OLED (12:43) or even Dell's own XPS 13 (13:15).\nWrap-up\nEven with a new and rather uninspired name, it probably shouldn't come as a surprise that the Dell 14 Premium remains one of the best Windows laptops on the market. It has the same sleek design from back when it was still called the XPS 14 but with some refreshed specs and components for 2025. Its chassis strikes a brilliant balance between modern minimalism and usability, while upgrades like its OLED display and discrete graphics give you the ability to build out a versatile but still very portable device.\n\n\n\n\n   Sam Rutherford for Engadget \n \n\nNow I admit that our fully loaded review unit is a bit pricey with a retail price of $2,450, though I'd be remiss to mention that Dell is currently running a sale that knocks $200 off that cost. Regardless, with the base model starting at $1,650 (before discounts) or $1,850 when paired with Dell's optional OLED panel (which everyone should at least consider), the 14 Premium still feels like a great deal. And when you consider that the XPS 13 isn't getting any updates this year on top of having fewer ports, the choice becomes even clearer. If I were going to spend my own money on a traditional Windows ultraportable laptop, this is the laptop I'd get.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/dell-premium-14-review-new-name-same-great-laptop-120047563.html?src=rss",

    "full_text": "UGreen’s MagFlow Qi2 3-in-1 charger station offers a ton of value for $100. The company managed to build a trio charger that works well as a permanent fixture on your bedside table or desk, as well as a compact portable charging station. As the former, it takes up very little space when fully setup, and the magnetic phone charger can be tilt-adjusted up to 70 degrees so you can get the right viewing angle if you’re watching videos on your iPhone while charging. The Apple Watch charging pad is similarly adjustable, and the space that wirelessly powers up AirPods or other earbuds sits right in front of that. The design is clever and feels premium without being too heavy, and I appreciate the soft-touch accents throughout. There are also four rubberized feet on the bottom so the device is less likely to move around or fall over when perched on a table. Plus, UGreen includes a USB-C to C cable and a 30W adapter in the box, so you’re given everything the station needs to power up all your devices as quickly as possible."

    "summary": "To find the best power bank out there, I tested around 50 portable chargers and batteries from big brands — Anker, Belkin, UGreen, Mophie — as well as some smaller players like Lion Energy, Nimble and Satechi. I used them to recharge a number of devices including iPhones, Galaxy phones, an iPad, a MacBook and even my ereaders and PlayStation controller. If you just want a brick that can charge anything, go for Anker’s 25kmAh Laptop Power bank. It has two built-in USB-C cables, a massive capacity and super fast charging speeds. But if that’s not quite what you’re looking for, you can check out ten more of the best power banks below.Editor’s note: Anker recently issued two recalls, one for its PowerCore 10000 power bank (model A1263) and another for multiple power banks (model numbers A1647, A1652, A1257, A1681 and A1689). All recalls are due to a potential fire risk in the lithium-ion cells. If you have one of these batteries, visit Anker’s recall page for the next steps. None of the batteries we currently recommend are part of the recall, and we haven’t recommended these specific models in previous iterations of this guide.\nTable of contents\n\nBest power banks for 2025\nHow we test best power banks\nWhat to look for in a portable battery pack\nOther power banks we tested\nPower bank FAQs\n\nBest power banks for 2025\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhat to look for in a portable battery pack\nBattery type\nNearly every rechargeable power bank you can buy (and most portable devices) contain a lithium-ion battery. These beat other current battery types in terms of size-to-charge capacity, and have even increased in energy density by eight fold in the past 14 years. They also don’t suffer from a memory effect (where a battery's lifespan deteriorates due to partial charges). \nFlying with portable batteries\nYou may have heard about lithium ion batteries overheating and catching fire — a recent Hong Kong flight was grounded after just such a thing happened in an overhead bin. Current restrictions implemented by the TSA still allow external batteries rated at 100Wh or less (which all of our recommendations are) to fly with you, but only in your carry-on luggage — they can’t be checked.\nRecently, Southwest Airlines was the first in the industry to take that rule one step further. Now, flyers on that airline must keep power banks in clear view when using them to recharge a device. If the portable charger isn’t actively in use, however, it can stay in your carry-on bag in the overhead bin.\nCapacity\nPower bank manufacturers almost always list a battery’s capacity in milliamp hours, or mAh. Smaller batteries with a 5,000mAh capacity make good phone chargers and can fill a smartphone to between 50 and 75 percent. Larger batteries that can recharge laptops and tablets, or give phones multiple charges, can exceed 25,000mAh and we have a separate guide that covers that entire category. \nUnsurprisingly, the prices on most batteries goes up as mAh capacity increases, and since batteries are physical storage units, size and weight go up with capacity as well. If you want more power, be prepared to spend more and carry around a heavier brick.\nYou might think that a 10,000mAh power bank could charge a 5,000mAh phone to 100 percent twice, but that’s not the case. In addition to simple energy loss through heat dissipation, factors like voltage conversion also bring down the amount of juice that makes it into your phone. Most manufacturers list how many charges a battery can give a certain smartphone. In our tests, 10,000mAh of battery pack capacity translated to roughly 5,800mAh of device charge. 20,000mAh chargers delivered around 11,250mAh to a device, and 25,000mAh banks translated to about 16,200mAh of charge. That’s an average efficiency rate of around 60 percent.\nWireless\nMore manufacturers are making power banks with wireless charging. Not hassling with cables is nice, but it’s important to note that wireless charging is less efficient than plugging in your phone. Outside of MagSafe options, wireless portable chargers historically didn’t make the cut for our top picks for this guide for that reason. The Qi2 wireless charging standard arrived in 2023 and improves performance for wireless charging, including for portable banks. Currently, iPhones are the only handsets that support the new tech, but as it’s an open standard, expect Google, Samsung and others to adopt it for future phones. In my testing, I’ve noticed an uptick in the performance of non-Qi2-enabled batteries as well, so you'll now see wireless options on this list.\nPorts\nSince Apple ditched the Lightning cable and adopted USB-C, we’re getting closer to a standard for charging connections — and all of our picks have at least one such port. But plenty of other devices use older interfaces, like USB-A and microUSB ports, plus Lightning for older iPhones. You can find cables with just about any combination of those connections, so when you’re picking out a battery, just check that one end of your preferred cord will fit.\nMost battery packs have more than one charging port, which gives you different charging options. You’ll typically see at least one port labeled “in/out,” which means you can use it to both charge the bank and charge your gadget. While USB-A output ports can power up cell phones and other small devices, they can’t charge larger devices. Plus, they aren’t as fast as USB-C ports overall. That’s something to keep in mind when you’re deciding which ports and charging cables to use to connect your phone to the pack.\nThere’s even more variation among USB-C ports themselves, with different ports on the same device supporting different power transfer rates. What that means in practical terms is an iPhone will charge just fine plugged into a power bank’s 18W port. But to properly charge, say, a MacBook or similar laptop, it’ll need the extra juice supplied by a 100W port (which larger power banks can offer). Power banks with more than one port can also charge multiple devices at the same time, but speeds and the overall charge delivered will be lower.\nYou’ll also want to consider your charging cable. For anything larger than a smartphone (and to access fast-charging capabilities) you’ll want to use USB-C ports and cables. But not all cables are created equal, even when they have the same USB-C plugs on the end. If you want power delivery from a 100W USB-C power bank port, you’ll need a 100W-rated USB-C cable. Luckily, power banks capable of delivering 100W tend to include a compatible cable. For any devices that don’t, we’ve tried and liked Anker’s 100W USB-C cable. For smaller devices, we used this 60W cable from Nimble and we don’t recommend bothering with cables under 60W. For around $20, higher-capacity charging cables will make sure you’re not wasting time with connections that limit your potential power transfer.\nDesign\nFor the most part, these rechargeable batteries have a squared-off, brick-like design, though many nod towards aesthetics with attractive finishes and detailing. While that doesn’t affect how they perform, it’s a consideration for something you’ll interact with regularly. Some portable power stations include extra features like MagSafe compatibility, a built-in wall plug or even a kickstand. Nearly all have some sort of indicator to let you know how much available charge your power bank has left, usually expressed with lighted pips near the power button. Some of the newer banks take that a step further with an LED display indicating remaining battery percentage.\nHow we test best power banks\nBefore I even put my hands on a battery pack, I did extensive research. I considered brands Engadget reviewers and staff have tried over the years and checked out customer ratings on retail sites like Amazon and Best Buy. Then, I acquire the most promising candidates and test them in my home office.\n\n\n\n\n   Amy Skorheim for Engadget \n \n\nHere’s the full list of power banks we've tested, which range from small wireless banks to large, multi-device batteries:\nMagSafe-compatible\n\nApple MagSafe Battery Pack (5,000 mAh)\nSpigen ArcHybrid Mag (5,000mAh)\nAnker 521 Magnetic Battery (5,000 mAh)\nMophie snap+ PowerstationMmini (5,000mAh)\nBaseus Magnetic (10,000mAh)\nAnker MagGo Power Bank (6.6K) (6,600 mAh)\nAnker 633 Magnetic Battery (10,000mAh)\nAnker MagGo Power Bank (10K) (10,000 mAh)\nUGREEN 10,000mAh Magnetic (10,000mAh)\nEcoFlow Rapid Magnetic (5,000mAh) \n\nLow capacity (≤10,000mAh)\n\nMophie Juice Pack (2,400mAh)\nAnker 511 Power Bank (5,000 mAh)\nAnker 313 Power Bank (10,000mAh)\nNimble Champ (10,000mAh)\nBiolite Charge 40 PD (10,000mAh)\nAnker Nano (5,000mAh)\nNimble Champ (10,000mAh)\nSatechi Quatro Wireless bank (10,000mAh)\nAnker 10K Fusion power bank (10,000mAh)\n\nMid capacity (10,001 - 20,000mAh)\n\nBaseus Blade 2 (12,000 mAh)\nOtterbox Fast Charge (15,000mAh)\nMophie Powerstation Pro (20,000mAh)\nAnker Prime (20,000mAh)\nNestout Portable Charger (15,000mAh)\nNimble Champ Pro (20,000mAh)\nInfinaCore P3 Pro (10,500mAh)\n\nHigh capacity (20,001mAh+)\n\nMophie Powerstation Pro XL (25,000mAh)\nUGREEN Power Bank 25,000mAh 145W (25,000mAh)\nAnker 737 Power Bank (25,600 mAh)\nZendure Supertank Pro (26,800mAh)\nMophie Powerstation Pro AC (27,000mAh)\nLion Energy Eclipse Mag (27,000mAh)\nLion Energy Trek (27,000mAh)\nHyperJuice 245W (27,000mAh)\nAnker Prime 27,650mAh Power Bank (27,650mAh)\nAnker laptop power bank with built-in cable (25,000mAh)\nBelkin Boost Charge 20K with built-in cable (20,000mAh)\n\nWe're continuously updating this guide as companies release new products and we test them. We remove some products as we find picks that are more worthy of the best portable charger designation. We also add updated specs and prices where necessary. \nFor testing, I used each battery with some combination of an iPhone 15, an iPhone 14 Plus, an iPhone 11, a Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra, a Galaxy S23 Ultra, a 5th-gen iPad Air and an M1 Pro 16-inch MacBook Pro. I charged one phone battery at a time, even though some packs are capable of multiple-device charging. I charged the phones and tablets from between zero and five percent until they were 100 percent full (or until the power bank was dead), and didn’t use the phones or tablets while they charged other than to power them on and enter the unlock code. In the case of the MacBook, I used it while it was charging (it’s my work computer).\nI used the charging cable included with each power bank to charge the Galaxy S22 Ultra, MacBook Pro and the iPad Air. For the iPhones, I used the USB-C to Lighting cable that Apple provides. In the case of the lower-capacity power banks that didn’t include a cord or included one with USB-C to USB-A connectors, I used this 60W-rated USB-C to USB-C cable.\nFor reference, here are the battery capacities of each device we used for testing:\n\niPhone 11: 3,110 mAh\niPhone 14 Plus: 4,325 mAh\niPhone 15: 3,349 mAh\nGalaxy S22 Ultra: 4,855mAh\niPad Air: 7,729mAh\n16-inch M1 Pro MacBook Pro: 27,027mAh\n\nI noted the times for each charge and the number of charges each bank provided. I also paid attention to things like ease of use and overall design.\nOther power banks we tested\nHyperJuice 245W\nHyper’s massive-but-sleek brick is one nice looking power bank. The HyperJuice 245W packs a hefty 27,000mAh capacity, enough to refill my tester phone about four times and get a MacBook Pro from near-dead to 75 percent. It only has USB-C ports, but you at least get four of them. USB-C only is probably fine for most situations, but a USB-A port would be nice for charging the occasional older peripheral. The 245 wattage is pretty high for a power bank and it was indeed speedy. It filled a Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra in just over an hour. But it’s the same price and capacity as our Mophie Powerstation pick for laptop banks, and that one has a better variety of ports. Hyper’s battery is also comparable to Anker’s laptop battery, which is cheaper, has built-in cables and has nearly the same capacity. Plus, that bank is just as swanky looking.\nAnker Prime 20,000 mAh power bank\nAnker’s Prime bank was our previous pick for the best premium power bank, but I thought it worked best with the expensive (yet very convenient) base. Considering it also doesn’t have any built-in cables, we decided to bump the Prime battery from its position and replace it with the Anker Retractable Cable Laptop Bank. There’s still plenty to like about the Prime battery: it’s solid, attractive and tells you just how much charge it has left with its onboard display. When you add the optional base, you not only get a convenient drop-and-go way to recharge, it also acts as a charging hub with three additional USB ports.\nEcoFlow Rapid magnetic power bank\nI was curious to try out the first power bank from EcoFlow, a company that primarily makes larger power stations and whole-home backup batteries. The first offering in the brand’s Rapid series is a Qi2-enabled magnetic charger with a 5,000mAh capacity. It looks quite nice with shiny silver accents and soft-touch grey plastic on the MagSafe-compatible front. There’s a little pull-out leg that sturdily displays your phone as it charges and the attached USB-C cable lets you refill devices directly, then tucks out of the way when it’s not in use. But it didn’t outperform our top pick in the MagSafe category, in terms of both charging speeds and the amount of charge delivered.\nBaseus Blade 2\nThe Blade 2 from Baseus has a unique, flat shape that’s just a little wider than an ereader — which may make it easier to slip into a low profile laptop bag. It charged a Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra considerably faster than any other battery bank we tried, getting it from four percent to full in just over an hour. It then filled the phone back to 62 percent from dead on a second charge in about a half an hour. But $100 is a lot for a standard power bank that holds fewer than two full charges. But if you can find the Blade 2 on sale, snap it up.\nAnker MagGo (6.6K)\nAnker’s 6.6k MagGo is pretty similar to our top pick for a MagSafe-compatible battery pack. It supports the Qi2 charging standard and props up your iPhone so you can use it or enable StandBy mode while powering up. This one even lets you set the viewing angle from 30 to 65 degrees. It was speedy in getting an iPhone 15 up to 50 percent in about 40 minutes. But for the added bulk, it doesn’t have as much capacity as the 10K MagGo, holding just enough juice for a single full charge plus about 5 percent. But it is $20 cheaper, which may be key for some.\nMophie Snap+ Powerstation Mini\nThe Mophie snap+ Powerstation Mini is terribly well-built. It feels premium with a rubberized contact point for the MagSafe charging pad and a stand that runs the entire width of the bank itself, making it extra sturdy. It’s compact, too, but only carries a 5,000mAh capacity, which gets you a partial charge on most newer or larger phones. Our current MagSafe/iPhone pick has double the capacity, a stand and a digital display — for just $20 more than the Powerstation Mini.\nPower bank FAQs\nWhat's the difference between a portable power bank and a portable charger?\nA slew of terms are used to describe power banks, including portable batteries, portable chargers, external battery packs and even, somewhat confusingly, USB chargers, which is what wall chargers are often called. They all mean the same thing: a lithium ion battery that stores a charge so you can refill a smartphone, tablet, earbuds, console controller, ereader, laptop, or just about any other device with its own built-in, rechargeable battery. \nThere’s little difference between the terms, so the specs you’ll want to pay attention to are capacity (expressed in mAh), size and weight so you can find the right balance between recharging what you need and portability.\nPower stations, on the other hand, are distinct. These are bigger units (often around the size of a car battery) that can be used to charge multiple devices multiple times, but notably, they can’t be taken on airplanes.\nDoes fast charging actually ruin your battery?\nNot exactly. The real enemy of a battery’s longevity is heat. The faster you charge a battery, the more heat is generated. Modern phones have features that keep the battery cool while charging, like physical heat shields and heat sinks, as well as software features that slow down processes that generate too much heat. Phone manufacturers are keen to promote a phone’s fast-charging abilities, so they had to figure out ways to make faster charging work.\nWhile there aren’t long-term studies on what fast charging does to a phone, a study on EV batteries (which use the same general concept of charged lithium ions flowing from one side of the battery to the other, absorbing or releasing a usable charge) showed a very slight decrease in capacity over time with only fast charging — though what actually made a larger difference was how hot the battery itself was, due to ambient temperatures, when it was charged.\nIn short, fast charging could be slightly harder on your battery than normal charging. But the safeguards most smartphones have make that difference fairly negligible. To really ensure you’re taking the best care of your battery, limiting heat exposure overall is one of the best things you can do.\nCan you use a power bank for all your devices?\nThat depends on the size of the bank and the size of your device’s battery. A small 5,000mAh battery isn’t strong enough to charge laptops, but a portable charger with a 20,000mAh capacity will give your computer a partial refill. You also have to consider port compatibility. If your device has a USB port, you’ll be able to easily find a cable to connect it to a battery. If your device has a more unique port, such as a DC port, you won’t be able to use a battery. Devices with an AC cable and plug can be charged, and sometimes powered (such as in the case of a printer or speaker), by larger laptop batteries with AC ports.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-power-bank-143048526.html?src=rss",
    "full_text": "For reference, it took our former top pick in this category an hour and a half to do the same. There’s no digital screen to tell you how much charge remains in the battery, just four indicator LEDs. While color options probably won’t make or break your battery pack purchase, I appreciate that the BoostCharge 20K comes in something other than standard black. Mophie’s Powerstation Pro AC is so massive it necessitates a grab handle and get close to the edge of that max carry-on size. So it might be better to just remember how much you’ve used the brick rather than relying too heavily on its indicators. The Anker laptop power bank with built-in cable forgoes any clever naming scheme, but makes sure you’re never left without a way to charge your stuff. Current restrictions implemented by the TSA still allow external batteries rated at 100Wh or less (which all of our recommendations are) to fly with you, but only in your carry-on luggage — they can’t be checked. In addition to simple energy loss through heat dissipation, factors like voltage conversion also bring down the amount of juice that makes it into your phone. What that means in practical terms is an iPhone will charge just fine plugged into a power bank’s 18W port. For around $20, higher-capacity charging cables will make sure you’re not wasting time with connections that limit your potential power transfer."

    "summary": "Welcome to Video Games Weekly on Engadget. Expect a new story every Monday or Tuesday, broken into two parts. The first is a space for short essays and ramblings about video game trends and related topics from me, Jess Conditt, a reporter who's covered the industry for more than 13 years. The second contains the video game stories from the past week that you need to know about, including some headlines from outside of Engadget.\nPlease enjoy — and I'll see you next week.\n\nLet’s all agree to stop talking about that awful conservative activist group out of Australia. You know the one — like a parasite, it attached itself to the censorship campaign that erased thousands of adult games from Steam and Itch.io, and successfully positioned itself at the center of the delisting narrative. However, logic and evidence suggests this group had very little to do with the mass removals.\nThis Australian anti-porn organization led a movement in April to remove the edgelord simulator No Mercy from Steam, and since everyone agreed that game sucked, the campaign worked and the title disappeared from the storefront. This is where I believe the organization’s involvement in the current drama ends.\nIt seems No Mercy spurred payment processors including Visa, Mastercard and PayPal to turn their attention to the PC gaming market (an irony that I would find funnier if it weren’t actively eroding an industry I love). These institutions took the opportunity to dictate the types of games they would support, and in response on July 16, Steam added a clause to its ruleset banning content that \"may violate the rules and standards set forth by Steam’s payment processors,\" including “certain kinds of adult only content.” Censorship on Steam is not new; Valve has for years had rules banning mislabeled adult content, hate speech, anything violating local laws and many other regulations. But outsourcing censorship to payment processors is new, and hundreds of games were removed from the platform following the rule change. On July 24, Itch.io rolled out its own changes and summarily de-indexed every adult and NSFW game it hosted, which amounted to roughly 20,000 titles being hidden from search and browse pages.\nThe conservative Australian group claimed responsibility for the Steam bans on July 19, three days after the platform’s rule change went live. The organization said the censorship was the direct result of two of its recent efforts: an email campaign that sent 1,067 messages to Visa, Mastercard, PayPal and others claiming Steam and Itch.io were hosting illegal sexual content, and an open letter addressed to the same financial institutions, signed by faith-based, anti-sex work and anti-queer activist groups.\nThere is no evidence that these campaigns were directly responsible for payment processors’ renewed enforcements. It’s actually ludicrous to suggest that roughly 1,000 emails or an open letter would even register at companies the size of Visa, Mastercard or PayPal. What’s more, after taking credit for the removal of hundreds of Steam games, the Australian group has attempted to distance itself from the whole shebang. Following intense scrutiny from players, industry watchdogs and media outlets, every group in this situation is trying to avoid accountability, in fact. Valve says Mastercard made this happen, while Mastercard says it’s just following the law, and PayPal says it’s simply doing what companies like Mastercard tell it to do. Meanwhile, the Australian group is trying to avoid blame for the sweeping Itch.io delistings while simultaneously attempting to exploit the Steam bans and gain momentum for its conservative bullshit.\nIn the most likely scenario, the Australian activist group saw these PC gaming audits coming and, in a strange act of stolen puritanical valor, took steps to center itself in the conversation. We can stop helping it do so. Forget its name and, as the IGDA suggests, direct your ire toward the organizations with power in this situation, namely Mastercard and Visa.\nStill. It’s notable that an organization backed by conservative Christian groups that loudly oppose sex work, queer rights and freedom of expression was able to so cleanly align itself with financial companies censoring content on Steam and Itch.io. This uncontested endorsement is especially worrisome in a political and social climate where women, the queer community, people of color and those who don’t conform to a traditional conservative lifestyle are under attack. At a time like this, subversive and raw art is more necessary than ever, but it’s also in its most vulnerable position. Choosing this moment to activate a censorship campaign is not only dangerous for our most vulnerable communities, it’s cowardly.\nThere’s been some additional misinformation wrapped up in this censorship mess, of course. Three games were incorrectly reported as delisted or removed from Itch.io or Steam as part of this situation: Mouthwashing, Trials of Innocence and Console Me. One game that was unjustly removed during the chaos was the psychological horror game VILE: Exhumed — read my interview with creator Cara Cadaver right here.\n\nThe news\nBioShock 4 enters a new circle of development hell\nIn most contexts, I’d be pretty stoked on the thought of a hell-based BioShock, but this is the worst possible iteration of that idea. According to Bloomberg, BioShock 4 failed a recent review with executives at its publisher, 2K Games, and it’s heading back to developers at Cloud Chamber for a narrative revamp. Plus, Cloud Chamber studio head Kelley Gilmore is gone and creative director Hogarth de la Plante was moved to a publishing role. Not much is known about the game that’s assumed to be BioShock 4, but it was revealed in 2019 alongside the formation of Cloud Chamber, so it’s already been in development for quite a while.\nIn related Rapture news, 2K’s remake of the original BioShock was canceled earlier this year, Bloomberg reports. Ken Levine, the creator of the BioShock series, is currently working on a familiar-looking FPS called Judas at his own studio, Ghost Story Games.\nGOG gave away millions of games to protest censorship\nGOG partnered with developers to release 13 games with adult themes for free from August 1 to 3, in protest of all the censorship going down on Steam and Itch.io. None of the free titles were specifically banned in the censorship campaign, but they featured sexual, queer or violent content that could easily be targeted by similar efforts. GOG handed out its free games to more than 1 million players.\nItch.io is reindexing free NSFW games\nAfter deindexing all of its adult games on July 24 — like, all of them — Itch.io on August 1 relisted all free games in this category. Itch.io is currently auditing thousands of adult and NSFW games that it swept up in the payment processor ban, and it’s unclear how the platform will support titles with these themes going forward. One of Itch.io’s longstanding partners, Stripe, said it will no longer facilitate transactions of titles \"designed for sexual gratification,\" but there’s apparently room for negotiation in the future.\nBattlefield 6 will land on October 10\nIn a shocking twist, EA also revealed that Battlefield 6 will have multiplayer content.\nAge verification is coming to an Xbox near you\nThe video game world is feeling the effects of the UK's Online Safety Act. Platforms including Discord and Xbox are implementing new age-verification methods to comply with the law in the UK, and Microsoft is planning to expand its program to other regions. It's in no rush, though, saying it'll use the UK as a guinea pig for these systems first, and then implement what it learns across the globe.\nSony is suing Tencent over its blatant Horizon clone\nAt its unveiling in 2024, viewers instantly called out Polaris Quest’s Light of Motiram for looking an awful lot like Guerrilla Games' Horizon series — our headline called it a \"pretty blatant Horizon ripoff,\" even. It took the better part of a year, but PlayStation's lawyers have finally kicked into gear. Sony is now suing Tencent, which owns Polaris Quest, over what it calls a \"slavish clone\" of its IP.\nRaven finally has a union contract with Microsoft\nRecent layoffs at Microsoft have only heightened the importance of proper labor organizing in video games, and one of the industry’s first unions is finally making things official. Three years after initiating the process, Call of Duty support studio Raven Software has ratified its union contract with Microsoft. Raven Software initially voted to organize under Activision Blizzard, but after Microsoft completed its acquisition of the studio in October 2023, it continued negotiations with the tech titan.\nPlay VILE: Exhumed, the game that Steam doesn't want you to see\nAfter VILE: Exhumed was removed and permanently banned from Steam for reasons that don't actually apply to the game, developer Cara Cadaver and publisher DreadXP have rolled out their own distribution model, and prices start at $0. You can download and play the game right now for free, and there's an option to throw some money Cara's way. A portion of the profits will benefit the Toronto-based charity Red Door Family Shelter.\n\nAdditional reading\n\nKris Holt’s indie game roundup\nSam Rutherford’s review of the Legion Go S powered by SteamOS\n\n\nHave a tip for Jessica?
