    "summary": "Meta is no longer paying creators to post on Threads. The company quietly ended the Threads bonus program, which offered some creators thousands of dollars a month in bonuses, earlier this year, Engadget has confirmed.\nThe company hasn't officially commented on why it stopped the payments, but an Instagram support page that once listed details about the creator incentives no longer references Threads at all. In posts on Threads, creators who were once part of the program have said they stopped receiving payments around the end of April. That's roughly one year after Meta first started paying creators for popular posts. Though Meta never publicly shared a lot of details about how the program worked, creators who previously spoke with Engadget reported that they were able to earn monthly bonuses ranging from $500 to $5,000 in exchange for hitting specific metrics around post counts and views.\nIt's not clear what Meta's strategy for creators on Threads is going forward. The company is still trying to lure more brands and notable faces to the platform, and has tested features to help people find popular creators they previously followed on X. Meta has also added creator-friendly tools, like the ability to add more links to profiles and more detailed analytics for the app.\nBut Meta has yet to clearly explain what it can offer creators in return. The platform is hardly driving any traffic to outside websites. It's also much harder to build a following on Threads, since the platform defaults to an algorithmic timeline consisting mainly of recommended content. This means that it's easier for a post from an unknown account to go viral, but viral posts rarely lead to an influx of new followers.\nMeta may simply be calculating that Threads already has enough momentum without paying people for viral content. At the same time, Mark Zuckerberg has repeatedly said he believes the app can be Meta's next billion-user platform. It's difficult to see how that happens without the buy-in of creators.\nHave a tip for Karissa? You can reach her by email, on X, Bluesky, Threads, or send a message to @karissabe.51 to chat confidentially on Signal.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/meta-has-ended-its-bonus-program-on-threads-201627935.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Gamers aren't usually known for their sartorial elegance. But that doesn't mean we don't deserve nice things. So after checking out a very utilitarian carrying case for the Switch 2, I wanted to explore the other side of things with a more lavish travel bag. And while Waterfield's Magnetic case for Nintendo's latest console certainly isn't the most rugged or affordable way to lug a handheld console around, it might just be the most luxurious.\nDesign: Drape me in this leather\nCompared to most Switch 2 travel bags that are made out of materials like plastic and polyester, Waterfield's case is an exercise in opulence. It's crafted from buttery full-grain leather that's softer than than a perfectly worn in baseball mitt or fancy Dior gloves. It really is that nice. \n \nI've been using the white leather model as I love how clean and simple it looks while still giving you that irresistible pillowy exterior. But for the kind of folk who get excited about patina, the chocolate model features a more distressed look that isn't afraid to show off oil, scuffs and blemishes. And if the need arises, you can always hit the case with hot air from a hair dryer to reduce the appearance of scratches.\nBut the thing that sets Waterfield's case apart from its competition is that instead of relying on a zipper, the pouch has a series of magnets to keep everything together. And honestly, there's just something really nice about not having any sharp objects near or around the case, so there's no fear of your Switch 2 getting nicked. This enclosure system also makes it super simple to thread a cable inside, allowing you to charge Nintendo's latest handheld without it needing to leave the safety of its case. On a practical level, I've also found that because taking the console in and out is so quick and easy, I'm much better about putting things back when I'm done gaming.\nThe obvious downside to this is that it's easier for stuff like sand to get inside and if you're storing tiny accessories like a microSD Express card, there's no real guarantee it won't fall out while you're in transit. Additionally, the trade-off for the case's fancy leather exterior is that it doesn't have the hard, rigid panels used in a lot of competitors, so it's not the most rugged travel companion. If you press down on the outside of the case, you can feel things like console's buttons and joysticks, so this definitely isn't something you'll want to cram into an already stuffed piece of luggage.\nOn the inside, Waterfield's case is lined with a plush microfiber fabric that will keep the Switch 2 nice and cozy. There are also two pockets for stashing small items like charging cables, game cartridges or Joy-Con straps. But I do mean small, because anything larger will cause the case to bulge, which may put undue stress on the console.\nOptional accessories\n\n\n\n\n   Sam Rutherford for Engadget \n \n\nThis case doesn't come with much in the way of bundled extras. Though like a lot of luxury products (just look at the options list on a Porsche or Ferrari), you can purchase additional accessories such as cord clips, AirTag holders and more. But the most important of these are Waterfield's game card holders, which are available in several sizes (4, 10 and 20). So I went and bought a 10-slot sleeve and it really is the perfect complement to the case. Cartridges fit snug and the holder itself nestles neatly into the pouch's built-in pockets. I just wish one came included, as you're looking at an extra $10 to $30 on top of an already pricey travel protector.\nWrap-up\nStarting at $90 for the nylon or waxed canvas models or $120 for the leather versions, Waterfield's Magnetic Case for the Switch 2 certainly ain't cheap. That's more expensive than Belkin's Charging Case, which comes with its own battery pack. And that's before you factor in a game card holder.\n\n\n\n\n   Sam Rutherford for Engadget \n \n\nBut the sheer suppleness of its leather and its super soft interior might be the comfiest cocoon Nintendo's handheld will ever experience. Then you add in a magnetic enclosure system and it feels like Waterfield has managed to transform a product that might normally be an afterthought into something that's a joy to use all by itself. So for those who want a travel pouch that looks and feels just as good as the console it's protecting (if not better), this case is in a class of its own.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/waterfield-magnetic-case-review-the-most-lavish-way-to-carry-your-switch-2-around-200052731.html?src=rss",

Don’t miss the 20th anniversary of TechCrunch Disrupt, and a chance to learn from the top voices in tech — grab your ticket now and save up to $675 before prices rise. As the company waits for federal approval, Rocket Lab and VPA are seeking permission to use a temporary method called “kedging” to ensure the first five hardware deliveries can arrive on schedule starting in September. But the dredging application and Rocket Lab’s separate kedging request suggest that it’s not hardware delays, but maritime access that could be a bottleneck for the first launch. The company received permission for up to three beach barge landing test events – but these cannot take place between March 15 and August 31, so it is far from a long-term solution. Both filings highlight the importance of maritime access for Rocket Lab’s Virginia ambitions."

    "full_text": "Democrats already introduced legislation earlier this month to codify the rule, which would require subscription services to let customers cancel as easily as they signed up, through congressional vote. But now a group of lawmakers are also pressuring Republican FTC Chair Andrew Ferguson to reinstate it. It’s not yet clear whether either path toward restoring it will be fruitful, given that passing bills in a deeply divided legislature is a tall task, and Ferguson alongside Republican Commissioner Melissa Holyoak voted against the rule the first time around. But Democrats’ insistence on reviving it shows they believe it to be a politically winning consumer protection issue, a position some Republicans might also come around to. “A review of more than 16,000 comments from the public made clear what should be obvious: Businesses should not be allowed to trap consumers in costly subscriptions by making it difficult to unsubscribe—costing consumers valuable time and money while stifling competition,” the lawmakers wrote. “We urge the FTC to cure any perceived procedural defect and reissue the rule as quickly as possible to ensure consumers are protected from predatory subscription traps.” There’s some reason for hope that the FTC could get the rule back on track, even if it might look different than last time around. But that path forward still looks murky, especially in light of President Donald Trump’s upheaval of the FTC, an issue that’s still working its way through the courts. But Klobuchar and other Democrats aren’t looking at it as an either-or proposition. “The FTC should always be looking out for consumers and they did the right thing when they issued this rule,” Klobuchar said in a statement."

Honda has unlocked access to the Tesla Supercharger fast-charging network for the two electric SUVs and is now offering a Honda-approved adapter for connecting to any North American Charging System (NACS) DC fast-charging point. Pioneered by EV giant Tesla before being opened to the rest of the North American automotive industry in 2023, the NACS standard and charging connection has been rapidly adopted by nearly every automaker that sells or plans to sell electric cars in North America. Honda declared two years ago that it would be adopting NACS for its EVs starting in 2025, and today we see the fruits of that announcement. To connect to a Tesla Supercharger or other NACS DC fast-charging station, Honda is now selling an OEM-approved NACS-CCS adapter at authorized dealerships in the US and on the web at its Acura and Honda DreamShop online retailer. Third-party NACS-to-CCS adapters have existed for some time now, many of which are less expensive. However, Honda warns that damage to a vehicle caused by an unapproved adapter may void your EV's limited warranty. In addition to the new charging hardware, the Google dashboard software that's built into Prologue and ZDX EVs is also being updated to find and navigate to authorized Tesla Supercharger locations when people are searching for charging on the go. Owners will still need to install the Tesla Supercharger app on their smartphone to connect and pay upon arrival, but the automaker tells us that more seamless plug-and-charge capabilities are currently \"under development.\""

This little adapter lets me use a variety of different connectors, including some that belong to my older devices. As I mentioned before, it includes a number of different ports, some of which are no longer in use but I prefer to have on hand. There are other, newer models with a different selection of ports. I also think the whole spin-the-disk-and-the-cable-disappears thing is a lot of fun. And a color other than black might have been nice.

Apple is releasing its Store app in Saudi Arabia as well, and also plans on opening its first physical locations in 2026. Though Apple previously offered its App Store in the country, people in Saudi Arabia had to purchase Apple products through authorized resellers. Apple’s store launch aligns with a broader trend of tech companies investing more in Saudi Arabia, despite the country facing numerous human rights issues. During President Donald Trump’s visit to the Middle East in May, Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman announced the formation of Humain, a new AI company owned by the country’s Public Investment Fund.

This goes live on July 31, allowing folks to juice up at more than 12,000 Supercharger stations throughout North America. Some of the company's vehicles can already use these charging stations, with the Gravity SUV gaining access earlier this year.\nThat leaves the Air line of luxury EV sedans. These vehicles will be able to roll up to a Tesla Supercharger for a top-off at the end of the month, but there are some major caveats. First of all, Lucid Air EVs will require an official adapter that costs $220, as they don't ship with a built-in NACS ports. This adapter won't work with V1 or V2 charging stations, which whittles down the convenience factor a bit.\nThere's another problem for Air owners. The adapter is limited to a 50kW peak charge rate, which provides around 200 miles of range per hour of charging. The Air can typically achieve a 300kW peak charge rate. Not only is this hobbled charge rate bad for Lucid Air devotees, it's also annoying for people that own other EVs. Remember, the Air will have to sit at the charger for an entire hour, which will increase traffic at the station.\nLuckily, there are other charging stations available that make use of that 300kW peak rate. Air owners can use stations by Electrify America, EVgo and ChargePoint for a quick jolt. It's good to know that the Tesla Superchargers will be there in a pinch, which could come in handy during a road trip.\n\n\nThe company also recently unveiled the 2026 lineup of Air EVs. There's the Lucid Air Pure, which is a relatively streamlined option. Prices for this one start at $70,900. The Lucid Air Touring boasts an estimated range of 431 miles per charge, which is a decent metric. It starts at $79,900. Finally, the Lucid Air Grand Touring is the baddest of the bunch, with an estimated range of 512 miles per charge.

Apple’s fourth iOS 26 developer beta has reintroduced Apple Intelligence-powered notification summaries for news and entertainment apps, MacRumors reports. The company temporarily switched off the feature earlier this year after botching some headlines and promised they would be available again in a future update. After installing the new beta, your iPhone will show a splash screen where you can choose to have your notifications summarized. On that screen, you can select News & Entertainment as a category to be summarized, though as part of that category, Apple warns in red text that “Summarization may change the meaning of the original headlines. Verify information.” The splash screen also notes that notification summaries are a beta feature and that “summaries may contain errors.” The new beta, which was released on Tuesday, also makes the Liquid Glass design elements a little more liquid, according to 9to5Mac. The company has been messing around with the translucency of Liquid Glass elements as part of its beta updates, and when I initially tried it with the first beta, I thought it was a wild change to my iPhone. Apple is set to launch a public beta of iOS 26 sometime this month. Last week, Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman said it would arrive “around the 23rd” of July."

    "full_text": "For the last few years, subscription gaming services like Apple Arcade and Netflix have offered mobile game developers something of a haven for high-quality, premium mobile games: a type of game that had become vanishingly rare following the rise of the microtransaction-stuffed free-to-play model. But as these services’ once enviable lineup of indie games dwindles, that haven appears to be shrinking. Both services offered an interesting value proposition: Pay a monthly subscription fee to get access to a library of premium games, with some of those games available as mobile exclusives. In addition to serving as a publisher, Netflix took the additional step of outright purchasing game studios like Oxenfree developer Night School Studio and Cozy Grove studio Spry Fox to make bespoke games for the service. Netflix is increasingly focused on games tied to its own content. In its most recent quarterly earnings report, the platform briefly extolled its continued investment in titles like Squid Game: Unleashed and Thronglets — games tied to Netflix-produced Squid Game and Black Mirror, respectively. While these services don’t share much about hard numbers, third-party reporting suggested that the majority of Netflix users never engaged with the platform’s gaming offerings. So far Apple has only purchased a single game studio to make content for Apple Arcade, though its retreat to more casual offerings follows a similar pattern as Netflix. The free-to-play model has conditioned users that spending money for gaming content can be optional. Casual games like Monopoly Go make money through in-game advertisements or opt-in consumer spending on microtransactions, and few traditional paid games outside of Minecraft are now able to break through that mindset."

You can't stop marketing folks from trying to sell their products, but the administration can and should be a wise steward of public resources and the public interest. I expect we'll see proposals for new ways to deploy AI in government service. But this technology isn't magic, and it serves nobody (except whoever sold the AI) to give it jobs that then have to be redone by humans.

    "full_text": "It doesn't matter how many times you open and close the Galaxy Z Fold 7 phone -- it's highly unlikely to give out on you. Samsung Display (SDC) announced Tuesday that its latest foldable OLED panel \"remained fully functional after a 500,000-fold durability test,\" more than doubling its previous benchmark of 200,000 folds. Bureau Veritas, a French leader in testing, inspection and certification, tested the screen with 500,000 folds over a 13-day period at a temperature of 25°C (77°F). For those of you trying to wrap your head around the math, half a million folds translates to the average user folding their phone 100 times a day for 10 years, or prolific users doing 200 folds a day for 6 years. Samsung Display -- a separate company from Samsung -- says the durability results prove that \"durability is no longer a limiting factor in the lifespan of foldable smartphones.\" \"This new panel ... builds consumer confidence in foldable OLED durability.\" Bulletproof glass technology has helped Samsung Display develop its creaseless screens. SDC also added high-elastic adhesive to each screen layer, thereby enhancing fold recovery performance by four times the previous design. CNET reported last week that Apple has tapped Samsung Display to manufacture screens for Apple's first foldable iPhone, set to launch in summer 2026. Despite the hype around foldable phones, a CNET survey published on Tuesday showed 64% of people have no interest in buying one of these smartphones in the next year."

Bee CEO Maria de Lourdes Zollo says on LinkedIn that the company is joining Amazon to help “bring truly personal, agentic AI to even more customers.” Bee makes a $49.99 Fitbit-like device that listens in on your conversations while using AI to transcribe everything that you and the people around you say, allowing it to generate personalized summaries of your days, reminders, and suggestions from within the Bee app. My colleague Victoria Song got to try out the device for herself and found that it didn’t always get things quite right. It tended to confuse real-life conversations with the TV shows, TikTok videos, music, and movies that it heard. When asked about Amazon’s plans to apply the same privacy measures offered by Bee, such as its policy against storing audio, Amazon spokesperson Alexandra Miller says the company “cares deeply” about customer privacy and security. “We’ve been strong stewards of customer data since our founding, and have never been in the business of selling our customers’ personal information to others,” Miller says. “We design our products to protect our customers’ privacy and security and to make it easy for them to be in control of their experience — and this approach would of course apply to Bee.” Miller also notes that the deal isn’t yet closed, and its terms are “confidential.” All Bee employees have “received offers to join Amazon.”"

Then tap Make and you can choose which yarn to create a Pokemon plush with. However, I can't see a way to make one particular Pokemon. For example, when you select Fiery Yarn, you can tap Plush Rates in the bottom right corner of your screen to see what Pokemon that yarn can create. After you've woven your Pokemon plush, it's time to decorate. Tap and hold the hourglass to rewind your room, kind of like an Undo button. To do so, tap Shop in the top left corner of your screen and you can buy different bundles. It's unclear if you can solve a limited number of puzzles every day without issue, or if you'll have to buy the Basic Pack at some point to continue playing.

Legends: Z-A brings back Lumiose City's fashion scene, detective work Detective work in Legends Z-A appears to be a system for accepting quests from people around the city who need help with their problems, like trash Pokemon hanging out on restaurant tables outside.

What gives me pause is the software, which feels quite unfinished just over a month before it’s supposed to ship. The Sugar Console app lets you turn off and swap screens, among other features. And since you can only swipe out of apps from the designated “primary” screen, I often try to close apps only to find it’s not working because I’m doing it the wrong way. Also note that the rear LED always stays on — it’s a battery and charging indicator. Lastly, I suspect you’re curious about the battery life from its 21.5Wh pack, I won’t be able to give you a good idea yet because my tool was clearly misreporting the battery drain.

    "full_text": "As meandering and largely uninspired as the MCU’s multiversal project has been, First Steps does a fantastic job presenting a reality that looks and feels truly different from what Marvel has been putting on the big screen. The story isn’t all that much to write home about. But the team’s status as global icons has a lot more to do with their popular cartoon and the fact that they have established something very close to world peace through their work at the Future Foundation — a philanthropic organization focused on education and technological innovation. But the new Marvel feature charts a very different course as it introduces Shalla-Bal (Julia Garner), an alien from a distant planet, who arrives on a silver surfboard and warns the Fantastic Four that their planet has been selected for destruction by her master, Galactus (Ralph Ineson). The alien villains are core parts of the Fantastic Four’s comics mythos, and there aren’t all that many ways to riff on their whole deal. Much of what’s different about First Steps‘ take on its villains boils down to the way Shakman spends time depicting them in strange, fantastical environments out in space. Unlike many previous Marvel features that save their big, VFX-heavy set pieces for the final act, First Steps shifts into that gear much earlier with a visually stunning chase sequence that feels like a tribute to 2001: A Space Odyssey and Alfonso Cuarón’s Gravity. You get the sense that Marvel made a point of giving its VFX teams ample time to really fine-tune their work and give it the kind of polish that can make projects like this gorgeous, even when they’re at their most ridiculous (complimentary). As solid as First Steps is, it’s arriving as Marvel is trying to course correct its way out of a flop era, and it feels like this chunk of the multiverse might have benefitted from being able to exist on its own for a little while longer before being added to the mainline MCU stew. Marvel’s movies have been hurting for a new gravitational center, though, and these characters are well suited to become headliners as the studio pivots to Doom — so it makes sense they might take their first step into the MCU a little prematurely."

This system uses six antennas that automatically adjust depending on how the laptop is being held or used. “We developed a custom multi-layered laminate that meets all of these needs, enabling reliable 5G performance without compromising portability or design.” Microsoft has tested its 5G hardware with more than 100 mobile operators across 50-plus countries."

    "summary": "Elgato’s latest capture card supports 4K at 60 fps to capture rich in‑game imagery in all its glory. The Game Capture 4K S works with just about any modern console, PC or handheld gaming device, including the Switch 2. Retailing for $160, this is the CORSAIR subsidiary’s best value yet for capturing in 4K. Elgato's higher-end 4K X supports 4K capture at 144 fps but costs quite a bit more.\nThough a more affordable model, the 4K S doesn't skimp where it matters. The new capture card features zero-latency passthrough to your main display, and Elgato says latency in software previews can be as low as 30 milliseconds. Short of the most competitive FPS games, this is fast enough to play on a single screen if you must. If you are trying to capture a game like Valorant or CS2 and care more about frame rate than raw resolution, the 4K S can record at 1440p120 or 1080p240.\nThe 4K S also supports HDR10 passthrough up to 4K60, HDR10 capture to 1080p60 on Windows, VRR support and it has an analog audio jack for native team chat. The device is plug-and-play over USB-C for Windows 11, macOS and iPadOS. For those whose creative workflow lives on iPad, the 4K S can capture directly to iPad models with a USB-C port. Thanks to UVC compliance, the device is compatible with OBS Studio, Streamlabs, Zoom, TikTok Live Studio and other major broadcast apps.\n\nElgato is also releasing its newest capture application, Elgato Studio, which will replace 4KCU in the coming months. The software auto-detects the 4K S and offers ultra-low latency on previews. It will also include features like a snapshot tool for social media clips and allow creators to try out beta features through the software.\nThe Game Capture 4K S is available now for $159.99.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/elgatos-new-game-capture-4k-s-is-switch-2-compatible-164745527.html?src=rss",

During today's Pokemon Presents stream, we found out that new quality-of-life features will make competitive battling easier than ever before. Only time will tell how she (and her trusty Psyduck pal) deal with this turn of events. We heard about Pokemon Legends: Z-A today, but no dice when it comes to other Switch 2 games. The latest Pokemon Direct had a 24-minute runtime, so we were expecting to see some more new games. Here's everything that didn't make an appearance during the latest Pokemon Presents stream, leaving a Pikachu-shaped hold in my heart. Still, this Pokemon Presents stream didn't showcase anything especially groundbreaking and new on the gaming front. It'd be fantastic to turn over a new leaf and get good looking, polished Pokemon games on the Switch 2."

Etsy is not alone in profiting from this type of merchandise, as some sellers and buyers have also pointed out. Many major selling platforms have not banned “Alligator Alcatraz”-branded products at this time. Shopify didn’t respond, nor did smaller platforms like Redbubble and Teepublic. Walmart told TechCrunch it has clear guidelines around prohibited products, and those that don’t comply are “promptly removed.”) Etsy also featured a couple of sellers with pro-“Alligator Auschwitz” branded merchandise, among other listings for merchandise calling for its abolition (as seen in the screenshot below).

Watching the Human Torch set things on fire and the whole gang take on Silver Surfer -- in outer space -- not only gives us a taste of the danger they face, but also lets each character shine as part of a family of intelligent superhumans who care deeply about one another. We still don't learn much about his origins or motivations, but it serves as the great big bad for this story and gives these charismatic, heart-first heroes a chance to show off their powers and humanity.

The deal covers only streaming rights and doesn't include merchandising or what the pair's production company Park County gets in a separate deal with Comedy Central to keep the show running on that network. The show's 27th season was delayed to July 23 because of the behind-the-scenes maneuvering involving an ongoing acquisition of Paramount by Skydance Media. The TV series began on Comedy Central in 1997. Parker and Stone will take the stage at San Diego Comic-Con the day after the show's premiere on July 24 for a panel with Saturday Night Live alum Andy Samberg and Beavis and Butt-Head creator Mike Judge."

There are several ways to use a vibration plate, the most common being standing on its rectangular platform. However, experts agree that vibration plates offer the most benefits when used as part of an overall health and wellness plan. In other words, you shouldn't expect to lose weight or increase muscle strength just by standing on a vibration plate -- even if social media makes it seem so. \"The vibrations may also be disconcerting to people who have inner ear problems or balance abnormalities.\" \"You're going to experience much more muscle activation when doing it on a vibration plate machine.\" Scoot forward until you're hovering in front of the platform, only supported by your arms and legs. While it's true that vibration plates offer some compelling benefits, they aren't a shortcut to fitness. To get the best results from your vibration plate training, experts also recommend following a healthy diet and participating in other forms of exercise."

The Dreame X50 will take photos of your pets if you enable that setting. At its full price of around $1,700, the Dreame X50 Ultra is a very expensive robot vacuum.

You'd be statistically safer consuming unwashed food from the Clean 15 than the Dirty Dozen, but it's still a good rule of thumb to rinse all of your fruits and vegetables before eating them. The analysis focuses on which fruits and vegetables are most likely to contain one or more pesticides but does not measure how much of any one pesticide is on a given piece of produce."

The direct-to-cell messaging service represents a major step forward in mobile technology: It works with most phones made during the last four years, according to T-Mobile, instead of requiring dedicated hardware. It'll be available to T-Mobile, AT&T and Verizon customers for $10 a month -- or free for anyone on T-Mobile's Experience Beyond or Go5G Next plans. The company said 911 texting will be available later this year to \"any mobile customer with a compatible device, regardless of carrier or whether or not they are subscribed to the service.\" Satellite connectivity in cellphones isn’t exactly new -- iPhones have had it since 2022 -- but it’s typically been reserved for SOS messaging to connect you with an emergency dispatcher. Android users will also get MMS immediately, with iPhone support “to follow.” Even if you don’t pay the $10 a month, T-Mobile says 911 texting will be available later this year “to any mobile customer with a compatible device, regardless of carrier.” If you’re a Verizon or AT&T customer, you’ll have to activate T-Satellite as a second eSIM on your phone to take advantage of the service. Most phones released in the past couple of years will work with T-Satellite. When T-Satellite launches on July 23, the following devices will also be compatible:"

Billed by its maker as the ideal entry-level fitness watch, the $99 Watch 3 Pro is the most advanced CMF wearable to date, promising updated health tracking and various built-in AI coaching features.\nThe Watch 3 Pro introduces dual-band GPS, which should make its route tracking more accurate, as well as a new four-channel heart rate sensor that Nothing says offers \"improved accuracy across all skin tones and workout intensities.\" You can choose from 131 sports modes, which is 11 more than its predecessor, with a personalized AI coach providing post-workout summaries and guidance. This includes long-distance running endurance predictions to help you train for that looming 10K.\nIn addition to the updated heart rate and sleep tracking, the Watch 3 Pro is also capable of blood oxygen (SpO₂) monitoring, stress tracking, guided breathing exercises, hydration and inactivity reminders, as well as women’s health tracking.\nOn-wrist ChatGPT integration allows you to ask questions and set reminders using \"natural language\" voice prompts, and there’s a voice recorder with autotranscription for when you want to quickly log a mid-run thought. You can also use AI to generate custom watch faces using the Watch Face Studio, in which you’ll find more than 120 styles premade out of the box. Widgets can be applied for fitness, weather, music or reminders, with a full-screen option available.\nCMF’s latest wearable has a 1.43-inch AMOLED, always-on display, and you’re getting a 10 percent increase in screen-to-body ratio compared to the Watch Pro 2 before it. Battery life is 13 days with \"typical\" use, which Nothing says is a two-day improvement over its predecessor. If you're hitting the tracking hard you can expect around 11 days of juice on a full charge. With the always-on display enabled, battery life unsurprisingly takes a significant hit to around 4.5 days.\nNothing says the Watch 3 Pro and all other smartwatches in the CMF lineup now use the Nothing X app, with the new control centre promising improved stability and a more intuitive UI. It also plays nice with Strava, Apple Health, and Google Health Connect\nYou’re getting a fair bit of bang for your buck, then, but we’ll have to wait and see how the Watch 3 Pro fares against pricier alternatives where everyday performance is concerned. When TechRadar reviewed the Watch 2 Pro earlier this year, it had lots of positive impressions of the watch, but noted some spotty fitness tracking and sensor detection. 9to5Google was even more critical, finding fault with the heart rate tracking and concluding that the product felt unfinished. And while the Watch 3 Pro covers a lot of the bases for fitness watches with its various sensors, it still lacks NFC for payments, which could be a deal-breaker for some people.\nAvailable in Dark Grey, Light Grey, and Orange colorways, the CMF Watch 3 Pro costs $99 (a not insignificant $30 bump on the Watch Pro 2) is available to buy now.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wearables/nothings-99-cmf-watch-3-pro-offers-better-battery-life-and-ai-fitness-coaching-151058055.html?src=rss",

This sweet and spicy sauce is made from a tamarind base with no tomato or vinegar. Like the winner above, Stubb's has a good balance with no single flavor taking over. There's a lot going on here but it harmonizes nicely to create one very tasty sauce. Bull's-Eye has a formidable sweetness but gets great balance from mustard, garlic and natural hickory smoke. At 15 calories per serving, it's probably the \"healthiest\" barbecue sauce on this list. Sweet Baby Ray's (hey, it's right there in the name) is made with corn syrup and pineapple juice and is so sweet that it can be overwhelming.

The Freelance Photographer serves as a long-term career partner to creatives, offering a comprehensive education, a supportive community, as well as the tools and insight they need to turn their craft into a career,” Eric Wittman, CEO of VSCO, said in a statement. VSCO’s first new app in more than a decade, Capture focuses on taking pictures with a set aesthetic. The app has more than 50 presets for images along with some real-time effects. The app also lets users sync all photos with VSCO’s cloud. The Freelance Photographer offers various courses, starting from $208 per month for the basic coaching plan, and a $625 per month that gives subscribers access to over 50 tools, several courses, and personal mentoring from the company’s founder, Paul Weaver. The acquisition fits neatly into VSCO’s aim of catering more to professional photographers. Last year, the company launched VSCO Hub, to enable brands to discover photographers for different projects, and VSCO Sites, which lets photographers create web pages to show off their work. In May, the company launched VSCO Canvas, a collaborative whiteboard product that lets users create moodboards for different projects."

They’re here to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge. Khan said Nevoya’s automation has been getting information to drivers faster, with fewer mistakes than humans would make. He also said that leveraging AI is not replacing dispatchers, but rather freeing them up to better communicate with Nevoya’s customers. He also said Nevoya has to be more creative with how it manages its fleets in places like Texas because there is less charging infrastructure. These locations get extra revenue during off-peak hours, and Nevoya gets to expand quickly with lower up-front cost. To manage this expansion, Khan said Nevoya is leaning on the same model that companies like Uber used as it entered new locations. As Xu saw Nevoya progressing, he remembered saying to Khan: “What would it look like if you actually raised a lot more than you were expecting to raise?” The two spoke about using more artificial intelligence to optimize their fleet management, while also keeping an eye on an autonomous future (hence the inclusion of Applied Intuition’s Younis in the round)."

    "full_text": "Owners of the Lucid Air sedan will be able to charge their luxury EVs at thousands of Tesla Supercharger stations in North America starting July 31, nearly two years since the automakers reached an agreement. But there is a notable caveat: Lucid Air vehicles won’t be able to charge as fast as Tesla vehicles. Lucid said on Tuesday that all Lucid Air sedans, regardless of model year, will be able to access Tesla’s network of fast chargers with an approved adapter that costs $220. Tesla V3 (and above) Supercharger stations are compatible with the Lucid Air adapter. However, the Air will only be able to charge at 50 kW, a far lower rate than the 250 kW peak rate that these Superchargers provide. Lucid spokesperson Andrew Hussey explained that engineers repurposed hardware in the Air’s integrated charging system, called Wunderbox, to make the system work and activate 50kW boost charging when using a Supercharger. He added that Lucid views the 50kW charging for Air as another option for owners who are on road trips, or live or work closer to Superchargers. The CCS was considered the go-to EV charging standard in North America and used by all automakers, with one notable exception. In May 2023, Ford became the first automaker to reach an agreement with Tesla that would give its EV owners access to the Supercharger network. Lucid was among the last companies to strike a deal with Tesla."

But if you’d rather hook the tracker to the outside, you’ll need something a bit larger and more flexible than a standard key ring. Belkin’s Secure Holder with Strap is a good option: it comes in different colors and it’s budget friendly at only $13. The case opens up into two pieces, allowing you to sit the AirTag inside the circle and twist and snap the two halves together to lock it in. You can then attach the AirTag to your luggage handle, dog collar, water bottle or other item with the strap, which feels quite strong. I appreciate the unique design of Belkin’s Secure Holder, although it was hard to twist open when the AirTag was inside of it. But that’s a good thing for daily use; your AirTag isn’t going anywhere when in the Secure Holder. I also liked its slightly raised edges, which provide extra protection against impacts and bumps."

    "summary": "Whether it’s your nephew who wants a new iPad, your sister who needs a new pair of AirPods or your parent who could benefit from an easy-to-use MacBook, Apple devices are some of the most in-demand devices you can get today. That means, unfortunately, that big discounts are few and far between, and they’re often the first to sell out when sales do arise. But make no mistake: you can find good Apple deals across the web, you just have to know where to look.\nEngadget keeps track of deals like these regularly, so we’re here to help. We’ve collected the best Apple deals on items like AirPods, MacBooks, iPads and more that you can get right now. Just note: you’ll find the best Apple deals from retailers like Amazon, Best Buy, Walmart, Target and others — not directly from Apple. Unless you shop refurbished, you’ll always pay top dollar direct at Apple, and for some things (like iPhones), that might be the best route to take.  \nBest Apple Watch deals\n \nApple Watch SE for $169 (32 percent off): We wouldn’t be surprised to see an update to Apple’s budget smartwatch sometime soon (and we have a few suggestions on the matter). But thanks to some serious discounts, the Apple Watch SE has turned out to be the most affordable way to get an iPhone companion for your wrist. Despite the lackluster screen and limited extra features, it handles the basics well. Also at Best Buy and Walmart.\nBest AirPods deals\n \nBest iPad deals\n \niPad Pro (M4, 11-inch) for $899 ($100 off): The most powerful iPad is the iPad Pro, and it’s the one to get if you’re even toying with the idea of using your new slab as a laptop replacement. Both the 11- and 13-inch models have gorgeous displays, thinner and lighter designs, a repositioned front camera and the excessively powerful M4 chip inside. Also at Best Buy. \nBest MacBook deals\n \nApple MacBook Air (15-inch, M3, 24GB RAM) for $1,299 ($400 off): The last-gen M3 MacBook Air has officially been discontinued, but it remains a superb laptop while the last bits of stock remain available. We gave this 15-inch model a score of 90 in our review — outside of its slower chip (which is still plenty fast for everyday use), marginally improved camera and inability to power two external displays with the lid open, it's virtually identical to the newer version. This deal applies to the model with the larger 24GB of memory in the Starlight colorway. \nMacBook Air (M3, 15-inch) for $949 ($350 off): The base model M3 MacBook Air is also available at a sizeable discount..\nApple MacBook Air (15-inch, M4) for $1,049 ($150 off): The 15-inch MacBook Air is nearly identical to the smaller version but features more robust speakers and a more spacious trackpad alongside its roomier display. Also at B&H.\nBest Apple accessories deals\nApple Pencil (USB-C) for $69 ($10 off): This more affordable Apple Pencil doesn’t support pressure sensitivity, but it still makes for a useful stylus for the basics. If you’re a casual note-taker and can live without wireless charging, you’ll save a few bucks by picking this one up. Also available at Walmart.\nApple Pencil (2nd gen) for $90 ($39 off): The Second gen Pencil both attaches and charges magnetically, supports tilt and pressure sensitivity and allows for tool changes with a tap of the flat edge. It’s an older pencil and isn’t compatible with the latest iPad models. This is the lowest price we’ve tracked this year, but it went as low as $80 for last year’s Black Friday sales.\nRead more Apple coverage:\n\nThe best AirPods\nThe best Apple Watches\nThe best MacBooks\nThe best iPhones\nThe best iPads\n\nFollow @EngadgetDeals on X for the latest tech deals and buying advice.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/best-apple-deals-150020110.html?src=rss",

The art style is pretty incredible in this trailer and looks to be a highlight of the project. Take a look for yourself.\n\nThis doesn't look like a full mod of the entire game, as that would be quite the undertaking. Rather, it reimagines the Necropolis section. The trailer ends with a confrontation with the boss of that zone, indicating the mod will be a retelling of the sequence, and not a reimagining of the whole game. This reminds me of the first installment of the Final Fantasy VII remake that was entirely set in Midgar.\nUnfortunately, we have some time to wait before we get our hands on this mod. The trailer indicates a release date in 2027. There's also the Bethesda-sized elephant in the room. Who knows if the company's lawyers will go on a letter-writing spree to get this project shut down. \nReally been pushing Alexander to make sure we've got a living, breathing, retro-futuristic (but sometimes seedy) world for NB RPG.

    "summary": "We are mere days away from the official launch of the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 on July 25. Amazon is enticing customers to try out the foldable handset by throwing in a $300 gift card with every pre-order. This can be used to purchase anything on the platform and is available with every color and both the 256GB and 512GB versions of the Z Fold 7.\nWe strongly recommend going for the 512GB model, as the two storage options are the same price ($2,000) during this pre-order period. Samsung is offering a similar promotion, but that $300 gift card can only be used on the company's official store. This could be a good fit for those looking for accessories, but Amazon offers more bang for your buck. \n \nDespite not actually being out yet, the Z Fold 7 is already making a splash in the foldable scene. We were so impressed with our review unit that we placed the gadget at the top of our list of the best foldable phones. It's a remarkably thin device, with a sleekly-designed hinge that stays out of the way when opened.\nThe 200MP main camera is fantastic, the specs are unparalleled and both displays are gorgeous. We called it a \"stunning device\" in our official review, going on to praise the 120Hz refresh rate of both screens and the peak brightness of 2,600 nits. We said that the displays \"pop a touch more\" compared to rivals like the Pixel 9 Pro Fold.\nThe main downside here is the price. We know foldables are the hot, new thing for the tech-obsessed, but $2,000 is a whole lot of cheddar for a handset. Today's deal (sort of) brings that down to $1,700, which makes things a bit more palatable.\nFollow @EngadgetDeals on X for the latest tech deals and buying advice.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/amazon-includes-a-free-300-gift-card-when-you-pre-order-the-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-151315661.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "If you’ve been shocked by how much you spend on streaming services lately, you’re not alone. Companies like Netflix, Disney, HBO Max and others have been consistently raising prices to the point where you may question if streaming is even worth it anymore. We at Engadget still think it is, but we also think you should be smart with your money — and that’s where streaming deals come in.\nYes, it is possible to get discounts on services like Peacock and Paramount+, even if those deals aren’t as common as a sale on AirPods. If you’re looking to save money and still stream all of the content you want, Engadget can help by laying out the best streaming deals you can get right now, how you can save with bundles and everything you should know before paying for yet another streaming service. \nBest streaming deals\nTrue streaming deals can be hard to come by. Most often, they’ll pop up during the Black Friday shopping period. On occasion, we’ll see them sparingly throughout the year and they usually take the form of a discounted monthly or annual rate for a limited period of time. Also, true streaming deals are typically on the ad-supported versions of a service, but once in a while you’ll find a unicorn of a deal on a tier that has ad-free viewing.\nIf you’re able to wait for a deal before subscribing to a streaming service, we recommend doing so. You’ll save money upfront and in the long run, and you also have the option to cancel your subscription before the price goes back up to the normal rate. Maybe you find you like the service so much that you’re fine paying full price for it — that’s the ideal situation. But if you’re not compelled to keep that app on rotation in your smart TV, most streaming services make it easy for you to cancel at any time. With that said, these are the best streaming deals you can snag right now.\n \nSpotify Premium Individual (1 month) for $0 ($12 off): This is our favorite music streaming service for podcasts and social features. Right now, users who have not signed up for Spotify's Premium service before are eligible to get one month for free. The Premium Individual plan lets you listen ad-free and skip songs at will. You can also organize your listening queue and download content for offline listening. Just be aware, your subscription will auto-renew at the end of the trial period. So if you don't want to be on the hook for the $12 monthly fee, set a reminder to cancel and go back to the free version.\nSling Orange for $23/month for the first month (50 percent off): New customers can get Sling Orange or Sling Blue for half off the usual price for the first month, bringing the final prices to $23/month and $25.50/month, respectively. Orange is likely best for sports fans, with eight exclusive sports and family channels, while Blue includes 19 exclusive news and entertainment channels. You can get both Orange and Blue access also for half off for one month, or $33 total.\nYouTube TV (two months) for $120 ($46 off): You can get two months of our favorite live TV streaming service for $60 per month which works out to $46 less than paying the full $83 each month. And right now, the service is free for the first 21 days. That should give you a decent chunk of time to see if the service is right for you. The discount and trial are only open to new subscribers to YouTube TV’s base plan, which includes access to over 100 channels, unlimited DVR space and six household accounts with the ability to stream on three devices at once. The deal ends July 31.\nFubo Pro for $65/month for the first month ($20 off): Fubo has introductory discounts on most of its packages, and the Pro package is the least expensive plan currently listed. It offers access to 224 channels, unlimited cloud DVR and up to 10 simultaneous streams. It even includes regional sports content from the NHL, MLB and NBA.\nSling TV + MLB.TV for $30 off: New subscribers can get $30 off their first month of Sling TV when they sign up and add MLB.TV to their package. The offer applies to Sling Orange, Sling Blue and Sling Orange & Blue, and MLB.TV gives you access to MLB Network along with access to all out-of-market games during the regular season. This offer runs through May 31.\nHBO Max student discount — subscribe for $5/month (50 percent off): HBO Max offers their ad-supported tier to students for half off the usual rate. You’ll just have to verify that you’re a student through Unidays, and make note that this offer is only good for up to 12 months of service.\nHulu student discount — subscribe for $2/month (75 percent off): Those with a valid student ID can get Hulu’s ad-supported tier for 75 percent off the typical rate. They’ll keep the same sale price for as long as they’re a student as well.\nSpotify student discount — Premium + Hulu with ads for $6/month (72 percent off): Spotify’s student offer continues to be one of the best around, giving you access to the Premium tier of the music streamer and Hulu’s ad-supported plan for only $6 monthly. Purchased separately, you’d pay $22 per month for both of the services. Plus, the first month is free when you sign up.\nNBA League Pass student discount — one year for $120 (40 percent off): Students can get one year of League Pass for only $10 per month, which includes access to NBA TV and the ability to watch classic and archive games on-demand. On the NBA League Pass website, look for the student discount banner at the top and follow the instructions to verify your student status.\nPeacock first responders discount — one year for $48 (50 percent off): Medical professionals and first responders can save 50 percent each year of Peacock. The deal requires annual verification and is open to those who work for either private or public institutions. Peacock has some great stuff to watch, including Poker Face and Killing It and more.\nStreaming bundle discounts\nThere’s more consolidation happening now than ever before in the streaming space, and that means there are more streaming bundle options. These bundles offer you access to more content with one subscription price, but those prices are typically higher than paying for a single service by itself (obviously). It may be tempting to just get the bundle, but if only one of those services in the bundle speaks to you, you’ll spend less overall by just paying for the single service.\nSpeaking of a deep love for a single streaming service: if all of your favorite shows are on Peacock or the latest releases on HBO Max consistently bring you joy, consider paying for one year upfront. Subscribing with an annual plan usually saves you money in the long term over paying on a monthly basis. Unfortunately, not all streaming services (looking at you, Netflix) have an annual subscription option. Here are some of the best streaming bundles you can get right now.\n \nDisney+, Hulu, HBO Max bundle with ads for $17/month: Ad-supported HBO Max is included here, along with full, ad-supported access to Disney+ and Hulu. You’ll save 43 percent with this bundle, as opposed to paying for all three services individually.\nDisney+ and Hulu Bundle Premium for $20/month: Disney and Hulu offer a few different bundles, which you can view in the drop-down lists under Choose Your Plan. This bundle removes the ads from both Disney+ and Hulu (with the exception of select live and linear content) and allows you to download content for offline viewing. You’ll save 42 percent with this bundle, as opposed to paying for both ad-free tiers individually.\nParamount+ with Showtime for $13/month or $120/year: This includes everything in Paramount+’s Essential plan, except the ads, and also provides access to Showtime content, live CBS streams and download features.\nSling TV + HBO Max starting at $53/month: Sling TV and HBO Max have partnered on a discount that gives new subscribers 50 percent off their first month of Sling TV, plus $5 off monthly when you subscribe to the Sling TV + HBO Max bundle. The standard price for the Sling Blue + HBO Max duo is roughly $58/month, so you'll get a monthly discount of $5 off that. In addition, for the first month only, you'll get half off the price of the bundle. The promotion also applies to the Sling Orange & Blue + HBO Max package, which has a standard price of $73/month.\nHulu + Live TV with Disney+ and ESPN+ for $96/month: This streaming bundle amalgamation is a bit confusing but it does offer a lot: you get live TV streaming via Hulu’s service plus access to the following VOD services: Hulu, Disney+ and ESPN+. Out of those three, only ESPN+ will have ads.\nDisney+, Hulu, ESPN+ Bundle Basic for $17/month: You get full access to Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+ content with this package, albeit with ads across the board. This bundle price is 46 percent off the total price of all three separate subscriptions.\nDisney+, Hulu, ESPN+ Bundle Premium for $27/month: Similarly to the Duo bundles, the Premium version of the Trio removes ads from most content in Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+, and you can download content for offline viewing. This price represents a 43-percent savings when compared to paying for all three ad-free tiers separately.\nRead more streaming coverage\n\nThe best live TV streaming services to cut cable\nThe best streaming services: Netflix, Hulu, HBO Max and more\nThe best streaming devices\n\nFollow @EngadgetDeals on X for the latest tech deals and buying advice.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/best-streaming-service-deals-133028980.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "If your PlayStation 5’s internal storage is starting to feel a little cramped, you’re not alone. With game installs regularly taking up over 100GB, expanding your storage is one of the easiest ways to get more out of your console. The best SSD for PS5 will not only give you extra space for your game library, but it should also meet Sony’s speed requirements so your games load just as fast as they would on the built-in drive.There’s a wide range of SSDs to choose from, whether you want a simple plug-and-play option with a heatsink or a budget-friendly pick where you add your own. Some offer better cooling, others come with software tools for managing performance — but all the drives we’ve included here are compatible, fast and reliable. Here’s what to look out for when upgrading your PS5 storage, and our top picks to help you get started.Read more: These are the best SSDs in 2025\nTable of contents\n\nBest SSDs for PS5 in 2025\nHow we test PS5 SSDs\nPS5 SSD FAQs\n\nBest SSDs for PS5 in 2025\n \n \n \n \nHow we test PS5 SSDs\nI’ve tested most of the SSDs recommended on this list, either for PS5 or computer use. I also bought and used our top pick in my own PS5. \nPS5 SSD FAQs\nHow much PS5 storage do I need?\nThe PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 5 Pro can accept internal drives with between 250GB and 8TB of storage capacity. If you already own a PS5, chances are you have a reasonable idea of how much storage you need ​​for your game library. If you’re buying an SSD with a new PS5 or PS5 Pro, or buying for someone else, it’s more difficult to tell what you might need for a high-performance experience.\nPS5 games are smaller on average than their PS4 equivalents, typically taking up between 30GB and 100GB, with some notable (and very popular) exceptions. If you’re a fan of the Call of Duty series, installing Black Ops 6 and Warzone 2.0 can eat up to 240GB. In other words, a full Call of Duty install will take up more than one-third of the PS5’s internal storage. If you’re not a CoD fan, though, chances are you’ll be good to store between six to 10 games on a regular PS5 internally before running into problems.\nYou also need to consider your internet speed. If you live in an area with slow broadband, the “you can just download it again” rationale doesn’t really work. At my old home, a 100GB download took me around eight hours, during which time it was difficult to simultaneously watch Twitch or, say, publish articles about upgrading PS5 SSDs. Keeping games around on the off-chance you’ll want to play them at some point makes sense.\n\n\n\n\n   Aaron Souppouris / Engadget \n \n\nOff the bat, there's basically no point in going for a 250GB PS5 SSD. Economically, 250GB drives aren’t that much cheaper than 500GB ones — and practically, that really isn’t a lot of space for modern games to live on. 500GB drives can be a decent option, but after years of declining prices, I think the sweet spot for most people is to opt for a high-capacity 1TB or 2TB drive, which should run you at most $200. The latter will more than double the PS5 Pro’s storage without breaking the bank.\nUnless you’re rolling in cash and want to flex, 4TB and 8TB models should mostly be avoided, as you’ll end up paying more per gigabyte than you would with a 1TB or 2TB drive.\nWhile the 825GB PS5 only provides 667GB of storage, that’s largely due to storage being reserved for the operating system and caching. If you install a 1TB PS5 SSD, you'll have, within a margin of error, 1TB of storage available for games. Out of the box, the PS5 Pro offers 1.86TB of storage for games, though you can eke out more if you delete the pre-installed Astro’s Playroom (gasp).\nSince neither the PS5 Slim nor PS5 Pro feature updated CPU architecture, all of our recommendations will work with whatever PS5 model you own.\nCan you play PS5 games on an external SSD?\nExternal hard drives tend to cost less than internal SSD counterparts (and there’s a good chance you might own one already). Unfortunately, there are restrictions on what you can do with them. An external SSD connects to your PS5 via USB, and is only suitable for playing PlayStation 4 games, or storing PS5 titles. That’s useful if you have anything but the best high-speed internet — it’s faster to move a PS5 game out of “cold storage” on an external drive than it is to re-download it — or want to keep your PS4 library on hand.\nDue to the limitations here, you don’t need the highest-performing model, although you should opt for SSDs over HDDs for improved transfer speeds and load times. Any basic portable drive from a reputable brand will do, with the Crucial X9 Pro and Samsung T7 being options we’ve tried and can recommend.\nWhich SSD cards are compatible with the PS5?\nThe official answer to this question is an “M.2 Socket 3 (Key M) Gen4 x4 NVME SSD.” But even within that seemingly specific description, there are additional factors to consider. The main requirements Sony has laid out for compatibility come down to speed, cooling and physical dimensions.\nFor speed, Sony says drives should be able to handle sequential reads at 5,500MB/s. Early testing showed that the PS5 would accept drives as slow as 4,800MB/s, and that games that tap into the SSD regularly — such as Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart — would cause no issues. Pretty much the only thing the PS5 will outright reject is one that doesn't match the Gen4 x4 spec.\nIn our opinion, though, using a drive slower than the specification is a risk that, if you don’t already have that drive lying around, is not worth taking. Just because we haven’t found issues yet doesn’t mean there won’t be games that could be problematic in the future. The price difference between these marginally slower Gen4 drives and the ones that meet Sony’s spec isn’t huge, and you might as well cover all your bases.\nSlightly more complicated than speed is cooling and size. Most new SSDs are going to be just fine; the PS5 can fit 22mm-wide SSDs of virtually any length (30mm, 40mm, 60mm, 80mm or 110mm, to be precise). The vast majority of drives you find will be 22mm wide and 80mm long, so no problem there.\nIt should be noted that the system can fit a 25mm-wide drive, but that width must include the cooling solution. Speaking of, Sony says SSDs require “effective heat dissipation with a cooling structure, such as a heatsink.” The maximum height supported by Sony’s slot is 11.25mm, of which only 2.45mm can be “below” the drive.\nThis previously meant some of the most popular heatsinked Gen4 SSDs, including Corsair’s MP600 Pro LP, would not fit within the PS5’s storage expansion slot. Since Engadget first published this guide in 2021, most NVMe makers, including Samsung, have come out with PlayStation-specific models that meet those requirements. That said, if you want to save some money, bare drives are often cheaper and it’s trivial to find a cooling solution that will work for the PS5.\nThe only component in an NVMe SSD that really requires cooling is the controller, which without a heatsink will happily sear a (very small) steak. Most SSDs have chips on only one side, but even on double-sided SSDs, the controller is likely to be on top, as manufacturers know it needs to be positioned there to better dissipate heat.\nSo, head to your PC component seller of choice and pick up basically anything that meets the recommended dimensions. A good search term is “laptop NVME heatsink,” as these will be designed to fit in the confines of gaming laptops, which are even more restrictive than a PS5. They’re also typically cheaper than the ones labeled as “PS5 heatsinks.”\nOne recommendation is this $6 copper heatsink, which attaches to the PS5 SSD with sticky thermal interface material. It works just fine, and in performing stress tests on a PC, we couldn’t find anything metal that didn’t keep temperatures under control. When you’re searching, just make sure the solution you go for measures no more than 25mm wide or 8mm tall (including the thermal interface material) and has a simple method of installation that’s not going to cause any headaches.\nOne last thing: When shopping for a PS5 NVMe, there’s no reason to buy a Gen5 model over a more affordable Gen4 model. As things stand, Sony’s console can’t take advantage of the new standard, and though Gen5 drives are backward compatible, they’re more expensive than their Gen4 counterparts. Just buy the fastest and highest-capacity Gen4 model you can afford.\nHow to install an SSD into your PS5\nIf you need guidance on how to install your new NVMe into your PS5 or PS5 Pro, we have a separate guide detailing all the steps here. Installation is pretty straightforward, but our how-to can help you if you're stuck. Just make note: Before attempting to add more storage via a PS5 SSD, ensure that you have Sony’s latest software installed.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/best-ssd-for-ps5-130004175.html?src=rss",
    "full_text": "It comes with a unique heatsink that you install in place of the storage expansion slot’s metal cover. I’ve tested most of the SSDs recommended on this list, either for PS5 or computer use. Keeping games around on the off-chance you’ll want to play them at some point makes sense.

    "summary": "Choosing the best Android phone can feel overwhelming as there are so many options from so many brands, it’s hard to know where to start. Unlike Apple, which sticks to its sleek lineup of iPhones, Android offers a world of variety. Whether you're eyeing the latest flagship from Samsung, a budget-friendly smartphone from Motorola or something unique with a foldable design, there’s an Android device out there to suit your needs.The beauty of Android is its flexibility. You’ll find phones with different screen sizes, camera setups, battery life and even quirky extras like stylus support or rugged builds. Plus, Android lets you customize your device to your heart's content – something Apple fans might envy. We’ve tested and researched the top Android phones to help you find the right one for your budget, lifestyle, and tech preferences.\nBest Android phones for 2025\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhat to look for in a new Android phone\nPerformance\nWhen it comes to picking our favorite Android phones, the main things we look for are pretty straightforward: good performance (both compute and AI), a nice display, solid design, sharp cameras, long battery life and a significant commitment to ongoing software support. For performance, not only do we look at benchmarks and other metrics, but we also evaluate phones based on responsiveness. Regardless of whether you’re reading, text messaging, scrolling through social media or playing a game, no one wants a gadget that feels sluggish. \nDisplay\n\n\n\n\nWhen it comes to displays, we generally prefer OLED panels that can produce rich, saturated colors with at least 600 nits of brightness, though many of our top mid-range and high-end phones can hit 1,000 nits or more. And more recently, most of our favorite devices also support screens with fast refresh rates of 90Hz or 120Hz, which adds an extra level of smoothness and fluidity.\nDesign\nNow we will admit there is a bit of subjectivity when deciding which phones look the best, but there are other design aspects like dust and water resistance or screen durability that can make a big difference to long-term survival. It’s also important to consider things like support for wireless charging, power sharing (aka reverse wireless charging) and UWB connectivity, which can have an impact on how your phone interacts with your other devices.\nCameras\nObviously, for photos we’re looking for sharp, colorful shots in both bright and low-light conditions. And we want video clips with high dynamic range, rich audio and smooth image stabilization. Extra cameras for ultra-wide and telephoto lenses are a plus. The best cameras should also include features like dedicated night modes, support for various video recording resolutions, and additional photo modes like timelapse, slow motion and more.\nBattery and software\nFinally, in terms of longevity, we’re looking for all-day battery life on devices that also delivered great results on our local video rundown test (at least 16 hours on a charge, but more is obviously better). Wireless charging capabilities have become almost ubiquitous over the past few years, and most of our top picks have this extra perk. Fast-charging is available on some Android phones, too. Finally, with people holding onto their phones longer than ever, we like to see companies commit to at least three years of software support, upgrades and regular security updates.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/best-android-phone-130030805.html?src=rss",
    "full_text": "Processor: Google Tensor G4 | Display: 6.3-inch Super Actua, up to 120Hz | Cameras: Rear array (50MP wide, 48MP ultrawide with Macro Focus, 48MP 5x telephoto lens), 42MP dual PD selfie front camera with autofocus | Battery: 4,700mAh But it was always a little too big and too cumbersome for those of us who have smaller hands or want our phones to fit in our pockets. Instead of a relatively large 6.8-inch screen like that on its bigger sibling, the standard Pro has a 6.3-inch display that is easy to maneuver. Better yet, with the Pixel 9 Pro, Google hasn't sacrificed any key feature to get to the smaller size, meaning you'll find the same camera setup and performance in both handsets. But the Pixel 9 Pro is also much longer-lasting than the XL, notching almost 25 hours on our battery test. Those distinctions aside, the Pixel 9 Pro lineup is our favorite Android phone because of its top-notch camera performance, intriguing AI features and a general grown-up vibe. While previous Pixel flagships had a colorful, blocky design that felt fresh, this year's devices feel solid and refined. Without the camera bars, they would be pretty hard to tell apart from Apple's phones. The Pixel 9 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro both start at $999, and though some of us have come to think of Google's handsets as the more competitively priced option, this year's model might be good enough to justify a premium price. If you still want something from the Pixel 9 family but don't want to pay $1,000, the base Pixel 9 is still a solid handset for most people."

But, it soon becomes pretty clear that there's a consequence for this. Earth is spinning faster and faster… and faster, and protestors blame CWC and the orbital circuit its travel system relies on. The days grow shorter, the climate events become more extreme and everything is hurtling toward disaster. Circular Motion follows Tanner, a kid from smalltown Alaska who lands a job at CWC, Winnie, a girl who has truly been through it, and Columbia professor Victor Bickle, who shot to viral fame after predicting a public infrastructure catastrophe. They're all connected, as we piece together through multiple POVs.

    "summary": "We've been busy in the Engadget reviews department over the last few weeks, keeping up with Prime Day, product launches and the accumulating stack of devices on our desks. If you missed any of our in-depth testing recently, you can quickly catch up on the latest camera, laptop, phone and soundbar reviews in the list below. \nSamsung Galaxy Z Fold 7\n \nSamsung made notable design changes on its latest flagship foldable phone, finally giving the masses a significant update after a series of iterative models. Senior reviews writer Sam Rutherford argued the company \"has finally achieved foldable phone nirvana\" thanks to the reductions in overall size and thickness on the Z Fold 7, making the niche handset appeal to more users. \"With its latest flagship foldable, Samsung has removed one of the remaining barriers preventing people from trying out the new breed of phones: excessive size and weight,\" he said. \nCanon R50 V\n \nContent creators who are just getting into vlogging will soon realize they need a camera more robust than their phone for better quality footage. Reporter Steve Dent explained that Canon's EOS R50 V excels at video, thanks in part to its quick autofocus, but the camera lacks the performance and features of its rivals. \"Canon’s R50 V is a pretty good first try for a vlogging camera, hitting the mark in key areas like video quality and usability,\" he wrote. \"However, its rival, Sony’s ZV-E10 II, beats it in nearly every area, offering even better video quality, higher photo resolution, faster autofocus, smoother electronic stabilization and neat features missing on the R50 V — like the product showcase.\"\nSamsung HW-QS700F\n \nLike the Z Fold line, Samsung has been on a streak of iterative updates for its flagship soundbars. For 2025 though, the company debuted an all-new model that automatically detects how you're using it and adjusts the speaker output appropriately. It's that trick, along with crisp sound, that makes the QS700F a contender even with its constrained 3.1.2-channel audio. \"Caveats aside, the best thing about the soundbar is its automatic orientation adjustment,\" I noted. \"The QS700F is easy on the eyes too, which isn’t always the case with these devices.\"\nPanasonic S1 II\n \nThe S1 II may be Panasonic's best camera for content creators, but there's one major downside: the price. Steve's assessment of this model's features, which include 6K RAW video and best-in-class stabilization, will help you weigh the potential $3,200 investment. \"Panasonic’s S1 II is a powerful hybrid camera, and if it wasn’t so expensive, it would be a no-brainer for creators,\" he said. \"However, Nikon’s Z6 III has nearly the same video capabilities, is a better camera for photography and costs at least $600 less, so I’m inclined to recommend that model for most users.\"\nDell 16 Plus 2-in-1\n \nThe Dell 16 Plus 2-in-1 is the company's first consumer laptop to feature its recently updated naming scheme, and the change in moniker is accompanied by refreshed styling. Sam explained that while the machine is perfectly capable, especially with the optional LED display, it's lacking personality. \"It's a totally serviceable machine, but it doesn't have a single trait or feature that endears itself to its user,\" he wrote. \"Same goes for its name.\"\nBelkin Charging Case for Nintendo Switch 2\n \nNow that the Switch 2 is out in the wild, Nintendo's handheld console needs protection. Sam put the Belkin Charging Case through its paces to find out if it's a worthy accessory. \"I kind of wish Belkin sold a version that doesn't come with a battery for anyone who wants to use their own power pack,\" he said. \"The company’s non-charging version of this case isn’t an ideal alternative as it doesn't have much extra space inside. But even so, this kit offers a solid combination of price and practicality, which is all I'm ever really asking for.\"This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/engadget-review-recap-galaxy-z-fold-7-panasonic-s1-ii-samsung-qs700f-and-more-123027122.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Welcome to our weekly roundup of the goings on in the indie game space. It's been quite the busy spell, with several notable games debuting or landing on more platforms and some intriguing upcoming projects popping above the parapet.\nThe Steam Automation Fest is taking place this week (it runs until July 21 at 1PM ET), so fans of games like Satisfactory and Factorio might be looking to pick up some bargains on similar titles. As well as offering a variety of discounts, Automation Fest also saw the debut of several new games.\n\nOne of them is from a studio formed by the original team from the celebrated developer Zacktronics. The first title from Coincidence (with the help of publisher Astra Logical) is Kaizen - A Factory Story. This puzzler is set in 1980s Japan, and you're tasked with building popular electronics of the day, including calculators, arcade cabinets, personal computers and toy robots.\n\nDawn Apart also arrived during Steam Automation Fest. This is a blend of space colony sim and automation sandbox set in a destructible, voxel-based world. Astra Logical is also publishing this project, which is from Industrial Technology and Witchcraft. Dawn Apart is available now on Steam in early access.\nOther new releases\n\nOne of the highest-profile indie games to debut this week is Neon Abyss 2, from Veewo Games and Kepler Ghost. The original game has sold more than a million copies, so plenty of people will have been looking forward to the sequel. This time around, you can play with up to three friends in co-op. The game's creators are promising \"unlimited item synergies\" here, which is handy since there's an onus on creating overpowered builds in this action roguelike. Neon Abyss 2 is out now on Steam in early access.\n\nReady or Not has been a hit on Steam since it arrived there in late 2023, and now Void Interactive's tactical first-person shooter has made the leap over to PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S. Here, you'll lead a team of SWAT officers in an attempt to restore order to a city that's become overrun by corruption and chaos. You can play the 18-level campaign solo or with up to five friends.\n\nBack to the Dawn is a story-driven RPG from Metal Head Games and publisher Spiral Up Games that's now out of early access on Steam. It has also arrived on Xbox Series X/S and Game Pass. \nAs Thomas the Fox, you're an investigative journalist who has been framed for revealing government secrets and tossed into prison. You'll have to forge alliances with other prisoners in your attempt to break out.\nAs part of Back to the Dawn's full launch, Metal Head is introducing a new character, Bob the Panther, as well as a fresh storyline. I like the art style here, and the premise is pretty compelling.\n\nThinking is cool and all, but sometimes you just want to turn down the volume on your brain and shoot a bunch of stuff. Kickback is an arcade bullet hell shooter with a fun twist: you can only move while you're shooting and, as the tile suggests, you'll be propelled backwards. I'm into it. Kickback — from Dot blood and publisher Targem Games — is out now on Steam.\n\nI'll be honest, I had no idea what Fretless - Wrath of Riffson was when I got an email from Steam this week telling me that this game, which I apparently had placed on my wishlist at some point, is now available. But hey, that name is an absolute winner.\nI appreciate the pixel art look of this turn-based RPG from Ritual Studios and publisher Playdigious Originals. According to the Steam page, you'll play \"as Rob, a friendly musician trying to restore harmony in an off-tuned world where wacky villains are corrupting music.\" That sounds quite lovely, actually.\nUpcoming\n\nI have absolutely no idea how Strange Scaffold does it. The studio behind I Am Your Beast, the brilliantly unsettling Clickolding and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown is about to unleash its seventh game in the space of two years. Co-Op Kaiju Horror Cooking is Strange Scaffold's first co-op game.\nThe trailer makes it look delightfully chaotic, as players rush to cook meals to satiate giant monsters and stay alive. Co-Op Kaiju Horror Cooking is out on July 29, but until then you can play the entire game for free as part of a playtest.\nWhat's more, Strange Scaffold has announced two more games: Truck-kun is Supporting Me From Another World?! is a \"chaotic anime-inspired vehicular action game about driving into objects at high speed to rescue the corporate ladder climber you accidentally isekai'd into a dangerous medieval fantasy world\" while Space Warlord Baby Trading Simulator is a \"fast-paced stock market sim about buying, selling, and shorting stocks based on the simulated lives of adorable alien children.\"\nBeautiful one-line pitches. Zero notes. Can't wait for those, or to find out about another new game demonstrating a \"unique method of developer collaboration\" that Strange Scaffold plans to unveil next week. \n\nIf you're hankering for more first-person parkour in a similar vein to Mirror's Edge, Neon White or Ghostrunner, Jetrunner might just do the trick. Riddlebit Software's platformer-shooter hybrid, which is published by Curveball Games, is coming to Steam on September 4. It looks like it could be fun! If the announcer's voice in the trailer sounds familiar, that's because the character is played by Matthew Mercer.\n\nI missed this one last week, but I just want to very quickly mention Ghost Haunting. The world needs more funny point-and-click adventures in the vein of those classic LucasArts games. Three Headed Monkey Studios and publisher Daedalic Entertainment have made a positive first impression to suggest they're ready to take that particular baton. There's no release date or window as yet, but this was an instant addition to my wishlist on Steam (let's just hope I don't forget about this one, eh?)\n\nI would love to play a tour manager simulator game at some point, getting into the nitty gritty of making sure gigs and everything else involved in a band's life on the road goes smoothly. Rockbeasts is not quite that, but it still seems like it could be a good time.\nThis is a \"grungy\" narrative-driven rock band management game from Lichthund and Team17. The trailer is fun and there are some interesting talents involved here. Rockbeasts was written by writer Jakub Szamałek, who was senior writer of The Witcher 3 and principal writer of Cyberpunk 2077. Even cooler is that Iggy Pop voices on of the characters, who is named Iggy Pup. Love it.\nRockbeasts is coming to PC and consoles next year.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/neon-abyss-2-a-prison-break-rpg-and-other-new-indie-games-worth-checking-out-110043805.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "If I had to describe the status of Subnautica 2 in just three words, it would be these: messy, messy, messy. That’s not to say the game itself is in terrible shape — this is actually a pivotal claim in the whole situation — but the relationship between Subnautica series developer Unknown Worlds and its parent company, Krafton, is in shreds. This month alone, Krafton fired the founders and CEO of Unknown Worlds, Subnautica 2 was delayed until 2026 and the ousted leaders filed a lawsuit against Krafton, looking to regain creative control of the game and the studio. At the center of the conflict is a bonus payment worth up to $250 million.\nHere’s a rundown of how we got here and what in the devil is going on with Subnautica 2, Krafton and Unknown Worlds.\nKrafton\nCharlie Cleveland accidentally started Unknown Worlds in 2001 while building the popular Half-Life mods Natural Selection and Natural Selection 2, and technical director Max McGuire came on as an official studio co-founder in 2006. Inspired by Minecraft and burned out on mods, Unknown Worlds began working on the undersea, open-world exploration game Subnautica and released it in early access on Steam in 2014. With years of community feedback, the game evolved into a singularly tense and rich survival experience, and version 1.0 officially landed in 2018. This is also when Ted Gill joined the studio’s executive team, freeing up Cleveland to focus on creative direction. Subnautica and its spin-off, Subnautica: Below Zero, attracted millions of players and established Unknown Worlds as a successful independent team.\nSo, the larger studios came sniffing. PUBG publisher Krafton, which operates with billions of dollars annually, purchased Unknown Worlds in 2021 for $500 million. The acquisition came with the promise of an additional payout worth up to $250 million if Unknown Worlds hit certain performance goals by the end of 2025. This bonus is a critical piece of the chaos today.\nWe know more about the details of this deal thanks to recent reporting by Bloomberg. In addition to the leadership positions, which were filled by Cleveland, Gill and McGuire, Unknown Worlds had about 40 employees at the time of the Krafton sale, and they received payouts totaling $50 million at closing and over the following two years. This larger group was poised to receive as much as $25 million in the 2025 performance-based earnout, with each person expecting a different amount, but most estimating six or seven figures. The remaining $225 million was reserved for the Unknown Worlds leadership, but they said they intended to share a portion of their windfall with employees who weren’t included in the bonus, covering the full studio headcount of about 100 people.\nKrafton\nThe leadership of Unknown Worlds repeated this promise in a lawsuit filed against Krafton on July 10, 2025. But we’re getting ahead of ourselves.\nAfter the acquisition, Unknown Worlds continued updating Subnautica and Below Zero. In February 2024, the studio released Moonbreaker, a turn-based strategy game that never really took off, partially because of its initial microtransaction system. Since then, the studio has been focused on Subnautica 2. The game was officially announced in October 2024 with a prospective early access launch window of 2025. It’s currently the second-most wishlisted game on Steam, after Hollow Knight: Silksong.\nThe first public notion that something was rotten between Unknown Worlds and Krafton came on July 2, when Cleveland, Gill and McGuire were fired and replaced by former Callisto Protocol studio head Steve Papoutsis. Krafton didn’t provide a reason for the switch-up in its press release, instead offering the following nearly complete thought: “While Krafton sought to keep the Unknown Worlds’ co-founders and original creators of the Subnautica series involved in the game’s development, the company wishes them well on their next endeavors.”\nKrafton didn’t mention delaying the early access launch at this time, but it implemented a review process that it said would be “essential to delivering the right game at the right time.” The publisher suggested the ousted leaders had been uncooperative in this aspect.\n“Unknown Worlds’ new leadership fully supports this process and is committed to meeting player expectations,” its press release said.\nCleveland published a blog post on July 4 reflecting on his time in game development, and sharing his disappointment at Krafton’s handling of Unknown Worlds and Subnautica 2. He also referenced Krafton’s intent to delay the launch.\n“You can see why for Max, Ted, myself, the Unknown Worlds team, and for our community, the events of this week have been quite a shock,” Cleveland wrote. “We know that the game is ready for early access release and we know you’re ready to play it. And while we thought this was going to be our decision to make, at least for now, that decision is in Krafton’s hands. And after all these years, to find that I’m no longer able to work at the company I started stings.”\nOn July 9, Krafton officially delayed the early access launch of Subnautica 2 to 2026. That same day, Bloomberg published a report outlining the performance-based bonus agreement and implicitly questioning how the timing of the delay would make it difficult for the studio to hit its goals, putting the payout in jeopardy. This was the first time the details of the bonus became public.\nKrafton shared a statement with Engadget — and in a pop-up on its own homepage — on July 10 that straight-up accused the fired leaders of abandoning the studio in favor of personal creative pursuits, specifically calling out Cleveland’s film production company. It also threw shade at Moonbreaker and claimed the former bosses wanted the bonus payment “for themselves.”\nKrafton\n“Krafton made multiple requests to Charlie and Max to resume their roles as Game Director and Technical Director, respectively, but both declined to do so,” the statement said. “In particular, following the failure of Moonbreaker, Krafton asked Charlie to devote himself to the development of Subnautica 2. However, instead of participating in the game development, he chose to focus on a personal film project. Krafton believes that the absence of core leadership has resulted in repeated confusion in direction and significant delays in the overall project schedule. The current Early Access version also falls short in terms of content volume.”\nThat same day, Cleveland announced that he and the other ousted studio heads had filed a lawsuit against Krafton.\n“Suing a multibillion dollar company in a painful, public and possibly protracted way was certainly not on my bucket list,” Cleveland wrote. “But this needs to be made right. Subnautica has been my life’s work and I would never willingly abandon it or the amazing team that has poured their hearts into it. As for the earnout, the idea that Max, Ted and I wanted to keep it all for ourselves is totally untrue.”\nThe lawsuit wasn’t unsealed until July 16. But on July 15, Bloomberg reported that Krafton now planned to extend the window for the bonus payment by an additional year, giving the studio more time to hit its goals. The publisher will also reportedly advance a portion of a separate profit-sharing bonus pool to all Unknown Worlds employees in 2025.\nThese moves seem designed to moot the core issues raised in the breach of contract complaint that Cleveland and other Unknown Worlds leaders filed against Krafton in Delaware Chancery Court. The lawsuit, unsealed on July 16, claims Krafton illegally fired the studio heads and delayed Subnautica 2 in order to avoid the bonus payments. It also provides a timeline of growing tensions between the founders and Krafton this year, accusing the publisher of intentional sabotage.\nThe lawsuit claims that Krafton and Unknown Worlds had a respectful relationship until April 2025, when Gill presented Krafton executives with the studio’s positive revenue projections, which were made with the assumption that Subnautica 2 would hit early access in 2025. He also outlined the expected bonus payout under the agreement.\n“When that happened, everything changed,” the lawsuit reads.\nThe complaint alleges that at this point, Krafton began looking for ways to force out the leaders of Unknown Worlds and delay the launch of Subnautica 2, with a goal of circumventing the bonus payment. Cleveland, Gill and McGuire argued back and forth with Krafton executives over whether the game was ready for early access, and Krafton eventually pulled all of its resources from the studio. Krafton issued a stop order on Subnautica 2 development, took over Unknown Worlds’ communications channels and in June it started laying an internal paper trail accusing the founders of abandoning their fiduciary duties, according to the complaint.\nCleveland, Gill and McGuire were fired and removed from the Unknown Worlds board of directors on July 1. This is where the rest of us entered the story.\n\nThe main conflict here is over whether Subnautica 2 is really ready for an early access launch, and that matters because of a potential $250 million bonus payment that’s jeopardized by a delay. Not only is this a large sum for Krafton to lose, but it’s also a massive amount of money for Cleveland, Gill and McGuire to miss out on, especially now that they’ve lost their studio and tentpole IP. The ousted leaders reiterated in their lawsuit that they “planned to share even more of the earnout with their dedicated team” than they were contractually obligated to. In the complaint, they’re looking for Krafton to pay out the full bonus as projected without a delay, fulfill its obligations as a publisher and reinstate them as the heads of Unknown Worlds.\nEvery party in this situation claims they want what’s best for Subnautica 2 and its players. It’s possible that they’re all telling the truth and this is a simple disagreement over artistic integrity. It’s also possible that they’re all lying and everyone is looking to make (or keep) a quick buck — but man, that’s bleak. The truth, as usual, likely lies somewhere in between and, chances are, we’ll never know it. At least the court system will eventually be able to determine the second-best thing, which is who’s at fault.\n\nHave a tip for Jessica?

    "summary": "Netflix admitted during its earnings call on Thursday that it used generative AI to create VFX in The Eternaut, a Netflix original from Argentina that was released in April 2025. The company's co-CEO Ted Sarandos said that generative AI was specifically used for a VFX shot in the post-apocalyptic drama, but the move is one of several ways Netflix is embracing AI.\nAccording to Sarandos, the creators of The Eternaut wanted to include a shot of building collapsing in Buenos Aires, and rather than contract a studio of visual effects artists to create the footage, Netflix used generative AI to create it. \"Using AI powered tools, they were able to achieve an amazing result with remarkable speed,\" Sarandos shared during the earnings call. \"In fact, that VFX sequence was completed 10 times faster than it could have been completed with... traditional VFX tools and workflows.\"\nThe shot \"just wouldn't have been feasible for a show on that budget,\" Sarandos says, as someone with some input on the show's budget. The executive says that The Eternaut features \"the very first Gen AI final footage to appear on screen in a Netflix original series or film.\" Clearly, the show is also a prototype for how Netflix can avoid costs it doesn't want to swallow in the future.\nWorkers in the entertainment industry have not taken kindly to the use of generative AI. Labor strikes — including the recently resolved SAG-AFTRA video game strike — have made securing protections against AI a central issue. The Oscar-nominated film The Brutalist came under fire in 2024 for using AI tools during production. Beyond that, whether generative AI models were illegally trained on copyrighted material is still an open question.\nNetflix plans to use generative AI to create ads for its ad-support Netflix subscription, and the company is reportedly testing a new search feature powered by OpenAI models. Using generative AI in production might seem par for the course for a company that's already invested, but it could help to normalize a technology that many creatives remain actively against.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/netflix-is-already-using-generative-ai-in-its-original-shows-201209502.html?src=rss",

Beyond that, whether generative AI models were illegally trained on copyrighted material is still an open question. Netflix plans to use generative AI to create ads for its ad-support Netflix subscription, and the company is reportedly testing a new search feature powered by OpenAI models. Using generative AI in production might seem par for the course for a company that's already invested, but it could help to normalize a technology that many creatives remain actively against."

    "summary": "Meta said on Friday that it won't sign the European Union's new AI code of practice. The guidelines provide a framework for the EU's AI Act, which regulates companies operating in the European Union.\nThe EU's code of practice is voluntary, so Meta was under no legal obligation to sign it. Yet Meta's Chief Global Affairs Officer, Joel Kaplan, made a point to publicly knock the guidelines on Friday. He described the code as \"over-reach.\"\n\"Europe is heading down the wrong path on AI,\" Kaplan posted in a statement. \"We have carefully reviewed the European Commission’s Code of Practice for general-purpose AI (GPAI) models and Meta won’t be signing it. This Code introduces a number of legal uncertainties for model developers, as well as measures which go far beyond the scope of the AI Act.\"\nSo, why kick up a (public) fuss about not signing something Meta was under no obligation to sign? Well, this isn't the first time the company has waged a PR battle against Europe's AI regulations. It previously called the AI Act \"unpredictable,\" claiming \"it goes too far\" and is \"hampering innovation and holding back developers.\" In February, Meta's public policy director said, \"The net result of all of that is that products get delayed or get watered down and European citizens and consumers suffer.\"\nOutmuscling the EU may seem like a more attainable goal to Meta, given that it has an anti-regulation ally in the White House. In April, President Trump pressured the EU to abandon the AI Act. He described the rules as \"a form of taxation.\"\nMark Zuckerberg at Trump's inauguration in JanuaryPool via Getty Images\nThe EU published its code of practice on July 10. It includes tangible guidelines to help companies follow the AI Act. Among other things, the code bans companies from training AI on pirated materials and requires them to respect requests from writers and artists to omit their work from training data. It also requires developers to provide regularly updated documentation describing their AI features.\nAlthough signing the code of practice is voluntary, doing so has its perks. Agreeing to it can give companies more legal protection against future accusations of breaching the AI Act. Thomas Regnier, the European Commission's spokesperson for digital matters, added more color in a statement to Bloomberg. He said that AI providers who don't sign it \"will have to demonstrate other means of compliance.\" As a consequence, they \"may be exposed to more regulatory scrutiny.\"\nCompanies that violate the AI Act can face hefty penalties. The European Commission can impose fines of up to seven percent of a company's annual sales. The penalties are a lower three percent for those developing advanced AI models.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/meta-says-it-wont-sign-the-eus-ai-code-of-practice-190132690.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "We tested all the major live TV streaming services and, after comparing the features and costs, we still think they are a better deal than paying for cable or satellite — but the gulf between the options is narrowing. Now that most subscriptions go for more than $80 per month, live TV streaming is not the amazing deal it once was.Still, there’s no contract, the pricing is simpler and you don’t need any special equipment beyond a smart TV and an internet connection. Our current top choice is YouTube TV; It’s the most well-rounded option that should please anyone looking for live sports, linear cable-style channels and/or local networks. But other services have their advantages, too, depending on what you want to watch. Here are the best live TV streaming services according to our tests.\nTable of contents\n\nBest live TV streaming services for 2025\nBest free live TV streaming services for 2025\nWhat to look for in a live TV streaming service\nHow we tested\nLive TV Streaming FAQs\nRecent updates\n\nBest live TV streaming services for 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to top \nBest free live TV streaming services for 2025\nThere are plenty of ways to get free TV these days. To start, many standard streaming apps have added live components to their lineups. You’re paying for the service, so it’s not technically “free,” but you can get a dose of live TV without spending more than necessary. Peacock includes some regional NBC stations, and notably access to the 2024 Summer Olympic Games. Paramount+ subscribers can watch on-air CBS programming. The standard Hulu app has a live ABC news channel and Max now includes a live CNN outlet with its service, along with cable-like linear channels.\nThe smart TV operating system (OS) you use likely provides free live content too: Amazon’s Fire TV interface has a live tab and Roku’s built-in Roku Channel includes hundreds of live channels at no extra cost. The same goes for Samsung TV Plus, which added a trove of K-dramas to its free live and on-demand lineup in 2024. The PBS app offers local live streams of its channels — even NASA has a free streaming service with live coverage. \nBut for a full suite of live TV networks, and don’t want to sign up for any paid service, there are a number of free ad-supported TV services that have live TV. Even cable company DirecTV has joined the crowd with MyFree, and Fubo Free lets customers with a lapsed subscription keep watching some content. Here's the best of the live TV streaming services we tried:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to top\nWhat to look for in a live TV streaming service\nHow to stream live TV\nStreaming live TV is a lot like using Netflix. You get access through apps on your phone, tablet, smart TV or streaming device and the signal arrives over the internet. A faster and more stable connection tends to give you a better experience. Most live TV apps require you to sign up and pay via a web browser. After that, you can activate the app on all of your devices.\nMonthly Price\nWhen I started testing these cord-cutting alternatives, I was struck by the price difference between live TV and a standard video streaming app. Where the latter cost between $5 and $20 per month, most live TV services hit the $80 mark and can go higher than $200 with additional perks, channel packages and premium extras. The higher starting price is mostly due to the cost of providing multiple networks — particularly sports and local stations. And, in the past year or so, every service except Sling has raised base plan prices.\nLocal channels\nOnly two of the services I tried don’t include full local channel coverage for subscribers and one of those makes no effort to carry sports at all. That would be Philo and, as you might guess, it’s the cheapest. The next most affordable option, Sling, only carries three local stations — and only in larger markets — but it still manages to include some of the top sports channels.\nWhen you sign up with any provider that handles local TV, you’ll enter your zip code, ensuring you get your area’s broadcast affiliates for ABC, CBS, FOX and NBC. Of course, you can also get those stations for free. Nearly all modern television sets support a radio frequency (RF) connection, also known as the coaxial port, which means if you buy an HD antenna, you’ll receive locally broadcast stations like ABC, CBS, PBS, FOX and NBC. And since the signal is digital, reception is much improved over the staticky rabbit-ears era.\nBut local channel access is another area where traditional streaming services, like Netflix, are bleeding into broadcast territory. For example, you can watch your local NBC station with a Peacock subscription and you can tune into your area’s CBS station through your Paramount+ subscription. Netflix is even getting into the mix with a recently announced deal with one of France’s broadcast companies, TF1. The streaming service will now air TF1's live TV channels and on-demand content inside the Netflix app. No word if the concept will expand to other regions, but it’s an interesting move to anyone interested in the future of streaming.\nLive sports coverage\nOne reality that spun my head was the sheer number and iterations of sports networks in existence. Trying to figure out which network will carry the match-up you want to see can be tricky. I found that Google makes it a little easier for sports fans by listing out upcoming games (just swap in NBA, NFL, MLB, NHL and so on in the search bar). When you click an event, the “TV & streaming” button will tell you which network is covering it.\nThat just leaves figuring out if your chosen service carries the RSNs (regional sports networks) you want. Unfortunately, even with add-ons and extra packages, some providers simply don’t have certain channels in their lineups. It would take a lawyer to understand the ins and outs of streaming rights negotiations, and networks leave and return to live TV carriers all the time. That said, most major sporting events in the US are covered by ESPN, Fox Sports, TNT, USA and local affiliates.\nI should also point out that traditional streaming services have started adding live sports to their lineups. Peacock carries live Premier League matches, Sunday Night Football games and aired the 2024 Olympic Games from Paris. Thursday Night Football as well as NBA and WNBA games are on Amazon Prime and Christmas Day Football aired on Netflix. Max (formerly HBO Max) now airs select, regular season games from the NHL, MLB, NCAA and NBA with a $10-per-month add-on. You can watch MLS games with an add-on through the Apple TV app, and Apple TV+ includes some MLB games. Roku users can watch the just-added free sports channel and those who subscribe to Paramount Plus can see many of the matches aired on CBS Sports, including live NFL games. This year, even the Super Bowl was live-streamed for free on Tubi. While all of these alternatives may not cover as much ground as live TV streamers, they could end up being cheaper avenues to the sports you want.\nAnd if sports is all you’re after, there are sports-only plans that are a touch cheaper, too. The promised sports streaming service from ESPN, Fox and Warner Bros. called Venu was cancelled early this year. But in May, ESPN confirmed it will launch its own streaming service that will include all ESPN channels, though a start date hasn’t been confirmed. DirecTV recently  announced a $70-per-month, sports-only streaming package called MySports and Comcast now has a sports and news bundle for the same price (as long as you're an Xfinity customer with auto-pay, otherwise it's more expensive).\nTraditional cable networks\nDozens of linear programming networks were once only available with cable TV, like Bravo, BET, Food Network, HGTV, CNN, Lifetime, SYFY and MTV. If you only subscribe to, say, Netflix or Apple TV+, you won’t have access to those. But as with sports, standard streamers are starting to incorporate this content into their offerings. After the Warner Bros. merger, Max incorporated some content from HGTV, Discovery and TLC. Peacock has Bravo and Hallmark shows, and Paramount+ has material from Nickelodeon, MTV and Comedy Central.\nOther channels like AMC+ have stand-alone apps. The Discovery+ app gives you 15 channels ad-free for $9 per month (or with ads for $5 monthly). And a service called Frndly TV starts at a mere $7 per month and streams A&E, Lifetime, Game Show Network, Outdoor Channel and about 35 others. Of course, most live TV streaming options will deliver more sizable lists of cable networks, but just note that you may already be paying for some of them — and if all you need is a certain channel, you could get it cheaper by subscribing directly.\nOn-demand streaming\nMost live TV subscriptions include access to a selection of video-on-demand (VOD) content, like you would get with a traditional streaming service. Much of this content is made up of the movies and TV series that have recently aired on your subscribed networks. This typically doesn’t cover live events and news programming, but I was able to watch specific episodes of ongoing shows like Top Chef or BET’s Diarra from Detroit. Just search the on-demand library for the program, pick an episode and hit play.\nPartnerships, like Hulu’s relationship with Disney, and add-ons, such as bundling Max with your YouTube TV subscription or Starz with your Sling plan, will let you watch even larger libraries of on-demand content. But again, if VOD is all you’re after, paying for those networks directly instead of through a live TV plan will be far cheaper.\nDigital video recordings (DVR) limits\nEvery option I tried offers some cloud DVR storage without needing a separate physical device. You’ll either get unlimited storage for recordings that expires after nine months or a year, or you’ll get a set number of hours (between 50 and 1,000) that you can keep indefinitely. Typically, all you need to do is designate what ongoing TV series you want to record and the DVR component will do all the hard work of saving subsequent episodes for you to watch later. You can do the same thing with sports events.\nAside from being able to watch whenever it’s most convenient, you can also fast-forward through commercials in recorded content. In contrast, you can’t skip them on live TV or VOD.\nSimultaneous streams and profiles per account\nEach plan gives you a certain number of simultaneous streams, aka how many screens can play content at the same time. And while most providers will let you travel with your subscription, there are usually location restrictions that require you to sign in from your home IP address periodically. Stream allowances range from one at a time to unlimited screens (or as many as your ISP’s bandwidth can handle). Some plans require add-ons to get more screens.\nMost services also let you set up a few profiles so I was able to give different people in my family the ability to build their own watch histories and libraries, set their favorite channels and get individual recommendations.\nPicture-in-picture mode and multiview\nPicture-in-picture (PiP) usually refers to shrinking a video window on a mobile device or computer browser so you can watch it while using other apps. Sling, YouTube TV, FuboTV, Philo, DirecTV Stream and Hulu + Live TV all have PiP modes on computers and mobile devices. Another feature, multiview, lets you view multiple live sports games at once on your TV screen. YouTube TV and FuboTV are the only live TV streamers that let you do this. With YouTube TV, you can select up to four views from a few preset selection of streams. FuboTV offers the same feature, but only if you're using an Apple TV or Roku streaming device.\n4K live streams\nRight now, just FuboTV, YouTube TV and DirecTV Stream offer 4K live streams — but with caveats. YouTube TV requires a $20-per-month add-on, after which you’ll only be able to watch certain live content in 4K. DirecTV Stream has three channels that show live 4K content — one with shows and original series, and two with occasional sporting events. You don’t have to pay extra for these but you do need to have either DirecTV’s Gemini receiver, or a device from Fire TV, Apple TV or Roku. You’ll need those same streaming devices to watch the select 4K programming on Sling as well. FuboTV shows certain live events in 4K but access is limited to the Elite and Premier packages, not the base-level Pro plan.\nOf course, watching any 4K content also requires equipment that can handle it: a 4K smart TV or 4K streaming device paired with a cord and screen that can handle 4K resolution.\nTiers, packages and add-ons\nComparing price-to-offering ratios is a task for a spreadsheet. I… made three. The base plans range from $28 to $85 per month. From there, you can add packages, which are usually groups of live TV channels bundled by themes like news, sports, entertainment or international content. Premium VOD extras like Max, AMC+ and Starz are also available. Add-ons cost an extra $5 to $20 each per month and simply show up in the guide where you find the rest of your live TV. This is where streaming can quickly get expensive, pushing an $80 subscription to $200 monthly, depending on what you choose.\nHow to stream live TV for free\nI also downloaded and tried out a few apps that offer free ad-supported TV (FAST) including Freevee, Tubi, PlutoTV and Sling Freestream. These let you drop in and watch a more limited selection of live networks at zero cost. Most don’t even require an email address, let alone a credit card. And if you have a Roku device, an Amazon Fire TV or Stick, a Samsung TV, a Chromecast device or a Google TV, you already have access to hundreds of live channels via the Roku Channel, the live tab in Fire TV, through the Samsung TV Plus app or through Google TV.\nBack to top\nHow we tested\nWhen I begin testing for a guide, I research the most popular and well-reviewed players in the category and narrow down which are worth trying. For the paid plans, just six services dominate so I tried them all. There are considerably more free live TV contenders so I tested the four most popular. After getting accounts set up using my laptop, I downloaded the apps on a Samsung smart TV running the latest version of Tizen OS. I counted the local stations and regional sports coverage, and noted how many of the top cable networks were available. I then weighed the prices, base packages and available add-ons.\nI then looked at how the programming was organized in each app’s UI and judged how easy everything was to navigate, from the top navigation to the settings. To test the search function, I searched for the same few TV shows on BET, Food Network, HGTV and Comedy Central, since all six providers carry those channels. I noted how helpful the searches were and how quickly they got me to season 6, episode 13 of Home Town.\nI used DVR to record entire series and single movies and watched VOD shows, making sure to test the pause and scan functions. On each service with sports, I searched for the same four upcoming NHL, NBA, MLS and NCAA basketball matches and used the record option to save the games and play them back a day or two later. Finally, I noted any extra perks or irritating quirks.\nAll live TV streaming services we’ve tested:\n\nPhilo\nSling\nYouTube TV\nHulu + Live TV\nDirecTV Stream\nFuboTV\nFreevee\nTubi\nPlutoTV\nSling Freestream\nPlex\n\nBack to top\nLive TV Streaming FAQs\nWhat is live streaming?\nStreaming simply refers to video content that is delivered to your screen over the internet. Live streaming can be split into two categories: linear programming and simultaneous transmission. That first one is similar to what you get with cable or broadcast TV, with channels that play a constant flow of movies and shows (sort of what TV looked like before Netflix). Simultaneous streaming lets you watch live events (like a basketball game) or a program (like the evening news) as they happen.\nWhat is the difference between streaming and live streaming?\nStandard streaming, the most popular example being Netflix, lets you pick what you want to watch from a menu of choices. It’s also referred to as “video on demand.” Live streaming refers to sports and news events that you can stream as they happen in real time. It also refers to channels that show a continuous, linear flow of programming.\nWhat streaming service is best for live TV?\nFuboTV does the best job of letting you organize live channels to help you find just what you want to watch. The interface is uncluttered and when you search for something, the UI clearly tells you whether something is live now or on-demand. YouTube TV also does a good job making that info clear. Both have just over 100 live channels on offer.\nWhat is the most cost effective TV streaming service?\nFree TV streaming services like PlutoTV, Plex, Tubi and FreeVee show plenty of ad-supported TV shows and movies without charging you anything. Of course, they won’t have the same channels or content that more premium subscriptions have. Ultimately it depends on what you want to watch and finding the service that can supply that to you in the most streamlined form so you’re not paying for stuff you don’t need.\nIs it cheaper to have cable or streaming?\nA basic cable package used to be more expensive than the base-level live TV streaming service. But now that nearly all major providers have raised their prices to over $75 per month, that’s no longer the case. And with add-ons and other premiums, you can easily pay over $200 a month for either cable or a live TV streaming service.\nWhat streaming service has all the TV channels?\nNo service that we tested had every available channel. Hulu + Live TV and DirecTV Stream carry the the highest number of the top rated channels, according to Neilsen. Hulu’s service also gets you Disney+ fare, which you can’t get elsewhere. FuboTV has the most sports channels and YouTube TV gives you the widest selection of add-ons.\nWhat is the most popular live TV streaming platform?\nYouTube TV has the most paying customers. According to 2024's letter from the CEO, the service has over eight million subscribers. Disney’s 2024 third quarter earnings put the Hulu + Live TV viewer count at 4.6 million. Sling’s customer count dipped from two million to about 1.9 million in 2024 and FuboTV grew its subscriber list to 1.6 million.\nHow safe are free streaming services and websites?\nYou may have heard certain sites that provide free content can be dangerous, leading to stolen info and/or exposing you to malware. That’s likely in reference to certain peer-to-peer (P2P) networks and file-sharing sites that let people download free movies and series — which can come bundled with malicious code.\nBut if you’re talking about the free ad-supported streaming television (FAST) services listed here, from providers like PlutoTV, Tubi and Freevee, they are just as safe as any other streaming service. Since you sometimes don’t even have to provide your email address or credit card info, they can even be more anonymous than apps that require login credentials.\nBack to top\nRecent updates\nJanuary 31, 2025: Added information about which streaming service would live-stream the Super Bowl, including Tubi’s free option. Updated Fubo’s pricing. Added details about DirectTV Stream’s sports-only package and Comcast’s sports and news bundle.\nJanuary 16, 2025: Included higher prices for Sling’s Orange and Blue plans. Noted the demise of the never-launched Venu sports streaming service and mentioned the inclusion of DirecTV’s new sports package.\nDecember 31, 2024: Noted increased pricing for YouTube TV, Hulu+ Live TV and DirecTV. Updated information for 4K streaming capabilities and requirements for multiple services. Reported on the upcoming shut down of Amazon’s Freevee service and the addition of DirecTV’s free service.\nAugust 6, 2024: Updated with the addition of Plex as a free live TV streaming recommendation and mentioned the additional free channels Philo is now including with the free version of its service. Added pricing information for ESPN's new sports-only streaming service, Venu. \nJune 12, 2024: Updated with more information about 4K live streaming, picture-in-picture and multiview modes, as well as video on-demand options. We expanded our recommendations around free live TV streaming services and added a FAQ query about the safety of free streaming services and clarified the difference between standard and live streaming. More traditional streaming services have added live and sports components, so we revised that section accordingly.\nBack to topThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/best-live-tv-streaming-service-133000410.html?src=rss",
    "full_text": "Now that most subscriptions go for more than $80 per month, live TV streaming is not the amazing deal it once was. Our current top choice is YouTube TV ; It’s the most well-rounded option that should please anyone looking for live sports, linear cable-style channels and/or local networks. There’s still no way to stop whatever is playing as you browse the guide — something I find irritating, but it might not bother everyone. The same goes for Samsung TV Plus, which added a trove of K-dramas to its free live and on-demand lineup in 2024. The FAST service has around 800 live TV channels that are organized fairly granularly and you can have up to 15 profiles. There was once a nifty integration with notable music streaming service Tidal, but that collaboration sadly came to an end late in 2024. People who don’t pay for Prime will still be able to access some of the free content through that app. Aside from being able to watch whenever it’s most convenient, you can also fast-forward through commercials in recorded content. Each plan gives you a certain number of simultaneous streams, aka how many screens can play content at the same time. YouTube TV requires a $20-per-month add-on, after which you’ll only be able to watch certain live content in 4K."

    "summary": "Samsung announced its newest devices during its Galaxy Unpacked event on July 9. That happened to fall on the second day of Amazon’s Prime Day event. Do big tech companies not know what the others are doing? Do they care? Do they like making the lives of tech reporters difficult? I didn’t have time to consider. Only when I was done covering Amazon did I have time to begin properly testing Samsung’s latest wearable. That means I’ve been living with the Galaxy Watch 8 for four days now.\nWhile that’s not enough time to complete a comprehensive review and tally a fair score, I was able to gather a good amount of first impressions — and let me tell you, they are nearly all positive. I’ll continue to evaluate the watch over the next few weeks or so and return for a final assessment. In the meantime, there’s a lot to say about the experience so far. \nSamsung packed a lot of updates into its latest smartwatch, in terms of both hardware and software. But I put extra effort into testing one feature in particular — and it’s one of the more interesting.\nAntioxidant tests and my persimmon intake\nThe Galaxy Watch 8 has the same processor and sensors as the previous generation, but it’s using those to detect a new metric: antioxidant levels. You have to take the watch off and hold your thumb on the sensor node for five seconds to get a reading and you’ll need to refer to the Health app in your phone for detailed results. The first time I tested, I got a score of 60, which falls right in the middle of the “low” segment of the scale. The only other results are “very low” and “adequate,” which will surely be a disappointment to the over-achievers out there.\nThe Health app suggested I “try eating one (100g) persimmon today.” When my grandmother was alive, she made persimmon cookies every Christmas and the last time she did so was also the last time I thought about that fruit. Considering South Korea is one of the world’s largest persimmon producers, it might make sense that a Samsung device suggested them. The produce guy at my local grocery store said they only carry them around the holidays (no doubt because grandmas insist, plus that’s when they’re in season).\nTurns out persimmons are high in antioxidants such as Vitamin C and beta-carotine (Vitamin A). Cantaloupe also has those nutrients — plus it’s orange like persimmons — so I bought one. In fact, I went hard on the antioxidants and did everything I could to see if I could get a better score. I ate a bunch of cherries and a little dark chocolate. For breakfast, I had half a cantaloupe instead of the very tasty-smelling breakfast hash my husband made, and I drank plain green tea instead of my usual oat matcha latte. I did yoga and went to my monthly medical massage appointment (stress is said to increase oxidant levels). I got eight hours of sleep and drank my weight in water. I felt ready.\nSo I took the test again and my antioxidant levels were… two points lower. Sigh. I wasn’t expecting overnight transformation, but I’d hoped for a little improvement. Next time, I’m eating the hash.\nFinally, a new design!\nSince its fourth generation, the Galaxy Watch has looked pretty much the same: a round glass screen set in a round metal case with large prongs popping out of the top and bottom to hold the band. While there was nothing wrong with sticking with a good design, giving a device a refreshed look lends the yearly update cycle some meaning — instead of feeling like an obligatory move to appease stockholders.\n\n\n\n   With 3,000 nits of peak brightness, the watch is easy to read even in the bright Albuquerque sun. \n \n\n   Amy Skorheim for Engadget \n \n\nThis time around, the Galaxy Watch 8 looks markedly different thanks to a shape borrowed from last year’s Ultra model. Samsung calls it a “cushion design” — a circular glass display set atop an aluminum case that looks like a roundish square (or squircle as our own Cherlynn Low calls it). The Sport band on my review model curves to meet the width of the case, creating a smooth arch that I think is more refined than the clunkier pronged configuration. In fact, the entire look is classy — much more so than the Apple Watch, which looks like a miniaturized iPhone 11 glued to a silicone strap.\nThe cushion design is great in one way, but also worrisome. Because the glass display stands proud of the case by at least two millimeters, my first thought was: “I’m going to trash this screen.” Immediately after taking the watch out of the box, I ordered screen shields and, during the short course of this review, managed to crack one. That’s possibly because I was cheap and ordered off-brand screen protectors, or perhaps the protruding glass cushion is simply begging for misfortune.\n \nHowever, the raised glass solves one complaint I had with the Galaxy Watch 7. One way to scroll is by running your finger along the outer edge of the screen. In fact, on-screen cues suggest that gesture when there’s more content to view. On the Watch 7, my finger was always getting in the way of the text I wanted to read. Now that the display is elevated, there’s room for my finger to travel further out along the outer edge and stay out of the way.\nAppearance aside, my favorite hardware update is how much more comfortable the watch is. The Watch 7’s underside had a sizable sensor node, and it took me a week to get used to the feel. Even then, I hated sleeping with it. The Watch 8, however, felt good the first time I put it on.\nGemini on your wrist and Wear OS 6\nThe Galaxy Watch 8 is the first smartwatch to ship with Google’s Wear OS 6, though Samsung overlays it with its own One UI interface. The headline feature for the new software is Gemini integration. Now, most things you can do with the Gemini app on your phone can be done through your watch. Just note that you’ll need to have your Gemini-compatible phone nearby to use it.\n\n\n\n\n   Amy Skorheim for Engadget \n \n\nGoogle’s AI was pretty snappy at basic tasks like setting reminders and timers. Requests that required more “thought” took only marginally longer (and completed more quickly when I was using my home Wi-Fi versus relying on cell signals out in the world). I asked for the best record stores in my city and a good place to eat lunch. I was pleasantly surprised to hear of a new-to-me answer for each category. The record store turned out to be two bins of LPs inside a book shop, but still, I hadn’t heard of it before. I asked why my eight-year-old talked about lava chicken all the time and was correctly informed about Jack Black and A Minecraft Movie.\nThe assistant displays answers in text form on the watch screen and also reads out every word. That can turn into a lot of talking, but tapping the screen stops the chatter if you prefer to read. Gemini can handle follow-up questions and tasks, but since it doesn’t usually keep listening after it speaks, you have to tap the mic icon to make your next request. \nI reached out to Samsung to ask if I could change a setting to make Gemini keep listening, but there isn't one at this time. For now, you'll need to tap or say \"OK Google\" again for followups like, “Add that to my Google Keep” or “Remind me about that.” If Gemini asks you a question, however, such as verifying a text it’s about to send, it does keep listening for the answer. You can also combine commands at the outset, such as asking to look up an address and text it to someone. \nI requested some fairly specific tasks and didn’t hit any snags. I asked it to text the address of a local restaurant to my husband and it verified which location I wanted then sent the message. I asked when the Albuquerque Isotopes were playing the Sacramento River Cats and it gave me the upcoming dates. I tapped the mic and said, “add that to my calendar,” which it did.\nIt only let me down twice. When I asked whether it was going to rain, it just read me the general weather forecast instead of answering the question. All the other assistants in my life (Alexa and Siri) can answer those questions — though technically that’s a Gemini problem, not the watch's fault.\nThe other disappointment is a matter of proper integration. I was out on a walk and I asked for directions to a nearby grocery store. Gemini told me the address and the distance, but pointed me to look at my phone for the actual directions. When I asked Siri the same thing on the same walk, directions simply showed up on my Apple Watch. (Yes, I’ve been wearing two watches and carrying around two activated phones like a double agent, just much less cool.)\n\n\n\n   Tiles on the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic \n \n\n   Amy Skorheim for Engadget \n \n\nIn addition to Gemini, Wear OS 6 introduces updated and larger tiles which organize and display information on your watch. By default, the tiles are separated into categories: Health, Fitness and Basic (weather, media playback, calendar) with each box displaying a bit of pertinent info — activity metrics, current temp, your next event and so on. If the limited info isn’t enough, tapping a tile opens the respective app. You can categorize, rearrange, swap out and add as many pages of these cards as you want in the Wear app on your phone. I didn’t have time to get the defaults tweaked exactly how I wanted, but it already feels like a much smarter way of interacting with a watch. Now you can glean key information from the apps that are important to you just by browsing your tiles.\nThe running coach believes in you\nThe Galaxy Watch 8 now comes with built-in, AI-fueled running guidance. This sounds a bit like the upcoming Workout Buddy that Apple announced for watchOS 26, so it will be interesting to compare the two. Google Pixel watches and Fitbits currently have the option of an AI-powered running coach, but it’s limited to Premium subscribers. Garmin offers an adaptive training program called Run Coach as well, so this isn’t an entirely novel idea.\nSamsung’s running coach begins with an assessment: Run as fast as you can maintain for twelve minutes. You’ll then be awarded a performance level ranging from one to ten. Each level comes with a tailored, four-week plan with four workouts per week intended to get you ready to complete a 5K, 10K, half or full marathon. My 12-minute, 22-second per-mile pace put me at a level three. My plan was geared towards getting me to run a 5K at the end of four weeks.\n\n\n\n\n   Samsung/Engadget \n \n\nThe first workout was low-intensity interval running with four segments of running hard, interspersed with cool-down walks. As I ran, the AI coach told me when and what to expect on the next segment and what my goals were for each. It spouted occasional words of encouragement and let me know when my pace started to lag. The guidance wasn’t intrusive and I appreciated the preview of and expectations for the next segment. I tried it relying just on the watch's speakers, and I could hear OK as long as the streets were quiet, but I definitely recommend using earbuds.\nI found myself running faster than I would have without a “coach” and now I’m honestly wondering whether I, a person my athlete sister describes as “not an athlete,” could actually complete a 5K. Maybe there’s some value in this concept after all. In any case, I find myself looking forward to taking it further. My next workout is a straight up, 30-minute jog. I’ve never continuously run for a half an hour in my life, so we’ll see how that goes.\nVascular load, bedtime reminders and battery life\nThe quick turnaround on this article means I didn’t get to properly test some of the new features. Vascular load takes readings while you sleep to evaluate the health of your circulatory system, then tells you when your load is higher or lower than normal and offers recommendations. It requires three nights of data to set a baseline, but after the third night of wearing the watch to bed, it said I still needed one more. \nThree nights of sleep should also trigger a Bedtime Guidance feature, but I didn't see an notification letting me know the guidance had begun. After asking Samsung why, I was told I needed to turn it on in the Health app (Health > Sleep > tap three dots icon > Bedtime guidance). So I'll report back on the experience after using it for a few days.\nOne of the prior model’s shortcomings was battery life. The always-on display (AOD) tanked the charge, so I kept it off. The Galaxy Watch 8 has a bigger 325mAh battery, compared to the 300mAh one on the Watch 7. Twenty-five milliamp hours isn’t a huge jump, but bigger is always better. Because I was testing every possible feature (sleeping, running, workouts, antioxidants, Gemini and more), I was constantly dropping the watch on the charger for partial refills in between tests. That meant I didn’t have the opportunity to methodically test the battery’s runtime just yet.\nI did note what I could. The first day of testing, the battery was at 100 percent at 4PM. The next day at 4PM it still had 17 percent remaining. That 24-hour period included driving directions, three workouts, lots of Gemini requests, watch face changes and a full night of sleep. I’d toggled the AOD on and off throughout that time, but the results were still better than what I tracked on the Watch 7.\nThe Galaxy Watch 8 Classic is super swank\nI didn’t have a ton of time to spend with the Classic version of the Watch 8, but it’s obviously aimed at the luxury watch-hound crowd. The knurled spinning bezel, inset diving bezel replica and the default chronograph watch face gives off serious Rolex Daytona/Omega Speedmaster wannabe vibes. It ships with a stitched leather-look band and the steel case has the heft and stature of an automatic mechanical timepiece. The always-on display and chunky buttons only add to the effect.\n\n\n\n\n   Amy Skorheim for Engadget \n \n\nFor me, the main advantage it has over the standard Galaxy Watch 8 is the protection the spinning bezel offers the raised display. The glass is shielded at the edges and it’s even inset slightly which will ward off scratches. It’s a bit chonky for my taste, but it’s surprisingly comfortable for its size and is extremely attractive. I could see this appealing to style enthusiasts who want a smartwatch but don’t want to look like they’re wearing a wrist gadget.\nPricing and the competition\nSamsung added $50 to the price tag on the 40mm Galaxy Watch 8, bringing it to $350. The larger 44mm model is now $380 (versus $330 last year) and the Classic variant is $500 for the single 46mm size. For reference, there was no Galaxy Watch 7 Classic and the Galaxy Watch 6 Classic sold for $400 for the 43mm size and $430 for the 47mm.\nAt $350, the base model Galaxy Watch 8 costs the same as Google’s Pixel Watch 3 (though the Pixel Watch 4 is almost certainly on the way and could be more expensive.) The Apple Watch Series 10 starts at $399, but it went as low as $279 during Prime Day. And, of course, a new Apple wearable is likely coming this September with a potential price bump as well. So Samsung’s Galaxy Watch 8 could end up being the most affordable of the major smartwatch releases once the dust settles from 2025’s launches. And if you’re a Samsung smartphone user, it’s easily your best bet.\n\n\n\n\n   Amy Skorheim for Engadget \n \n\nEverything else and an eventual score\nThe core functions of the Galaxy Watch 8 haven’t changed all that much. We went in-depth on the fitness and health features for our review of the Galaxy Watch 6 and covered the notable perks of Samsung’s wearable in our Galaxy Watch 7 review and our Galaxy Watch 5 review. So I’ll just point out that the workout tracking is still accurate — and it’s faster to suss out when I’m on a walk than my Apple Watch. The companion Health app, where you view all the data your watch gathers, is helpful and a delight to use with its common-sense suggestions and friendly animations. And the daily Energy Score is a useful indicator of how I’m doing with my sleep and movement goals.\nThe Watch 8 covers the basics well, acting as an industrious accessory for a Galaxy phone. Although, as with the Watch 7, I wish the notifications were more intrusive as they’re easy to miss. The double tap feature is great — a pinch gesture that dismisses or triggers actions without you having to touch the screen. I use it often and the watch almost always registers the motion. And finally, I love how customizable the watch faces are. When you combine all that with a substantially refreshed look, some capable Gemini integration, a few new health features and a more navigable interface, Samsung’s latest wearable becomes a very capable wrist companion. I still need to live with it a while longer (with a new screen protector firmly in place) to assign a review score, but so far, I’m impressed.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wearables/galaxy-watch-8-my-first-days-with-samsungs-smartwatch-have-been-promising-155857718.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Eliza McNitt is no stranger to new media. Her 2017 project, Fistful of Stars, was a fascinating look at stellar birth in virtual reality, while her follow-up Spheres explored black holes and the death of stars. Now with her short film Ancestra, McNitt has tapped into Google's AI tools to tell a deeply personal story. Working with Google Deepmind and director Darren Aronofsky's studio Primordial Soup, McNitt used a combination of live-action footage and AI-generated media to tell the story of her own traumatic birth.\nThe result is an uncanny dramatic short where the genuine emotion of the live-action performance wrestles agains the artificiality of AI imagery. The film begins when the lead's (Audrey Corsa, playing McNitt's mother) routine natal care appointment turns into an emergency delivery. From that point on we hear her opine on how her child and all living things in the universe are connected — evoking the poetic nature of Terrence Malick's films. We jump between Corsa's performance, AI footage and macro- and micro-photography. In the end, Corsa holds a baby that was inserted by Google's AI, using prompts that make it look like McNitt as an infant.\n\nThere's no escaping the looming shadow of Google's AI ambitions. This isn't just an art film — it's an attempt at legitimizing the use of AI tools through McNitt's voice. That remains a problem when Google's models, including Veo and other technology from DeepMind, have been trained on pre-existing content and copyrighted works. A prestigious short coming from Darren Aronofsky's production studio isn't enough to erase that original sin.\n\"I was challenged to create an idea that could incorporate AI,\" McNitt said in an interview on the Engadget Podcast. \"And so for me, I wanted to tell a really deeply personal story in a way that I had not been able to before... AI really offered this opportunity to access these worlds where a camera cannot go, from the cosmos to the inner world of being within the mother's womb.\"\n\nWhen it comes to justifying the use of AI tools, which at the moment can credibly be described as plagiaristic technology, McNitt says that's a decision every artist will have to make for themselves. In the case of Ancestra, she wanted to use AI to accomplish difficult work, like creating a computer generated infant that looked like her, based on photos taken by her father. She found that to be more ethical than bringing in a real newborn, and the results more convincing than a doll or something animated by a CG artist.\n\"I felt the use of AI was really important for this story, and I think it's up to every artist to decide how they wanna use these tools and define that,\" she said. \"That was something else for me in this project where I had to define a really strong boundary where I did not want actors to be AI actors, [they] had to be humans with a soul. I do not feel that an performance can be recreated by a machine. I do deeply and strongly believe that  humanity can only be captured through human beings. And so I do think it's really important to have humans at the center of the stories.\"\nTo that end, McNitt also worked with dozens of artists create the sound, imagery and AI media in Ancestra. There's a worry that AI video tools will let anyone plug in a few prompts and build projects out of low-effort footage, but McNitt says she closely collaborated with a team of DeepMind engineers who crafted prompts and sifted through the results to find the footage she was looking for. (We ran out of time before I could ask her about the environmental concerns from using generative AI, but at this point we know it requires a significant amount of electricity and water. That includes demands for training models as well as running them in cloud.)\n\n\"I do think, as [generative AI] evolves, it's the responsibility of companies to not be taking copyrighted materials and to respect artists and to set those boundaries, so that artists don't get taken advantage of,\" McNitt said, when asked about her thoughts on future AI models that compensate artists and aren't built on stolen copyrighted works. \"I think that that's a really important part of our role as humans going forward. Because ultimately, These are human stories for other human beings. And so it's, you know, important that we are at the center of that.\"This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/engadget-podcast-ancestra-director-eliza-mcnitt-defends-ai-as-a-creative-tool-150042942.html?src=rss",

When it comes to justifying the use of AI tools, which at the moment can credibly be described as plagiaristic technology, McNitt says that's a decision every artist will have to make for themselves. \"I felt the use of AI was really important for this story, and I think it's up to every artist to decide how they wanna use these tools and define that,\" she said. I do not feel that an performance can be recreated by a machine. I do deeply and strongly believe that humanity can only be captured through human beings. There's a worry that AI video tools will let anyone plug in a few prompts and build projects out of low-effort footage, but McNitt says she closely collaborated with a team of DeepMind engineers who crafted prompts and sifted through the results to find the footage she was looking for. (We ran out of time before I could ask her about the environmental concerns from using generative AI, but at this point we know it requires a significant amount of electricity and water.

This week, the company introduced a new filter for removing AI-generated images from search results. The next time you use the browser, you'll see a new dropdown menu titled \"AI images.\" From there, you can set whether you want to see AI content or not. \nNew setting: hide AI-generated images in DuckDuckGoOur philosophy about AI features is “private, useful, and optional.” Our goal is to help you find what you’re looking for. You should decide for yourself how much AI you want in your life – or if you want any at all. (1/4) pic.twitter.com/pTolmsEQlQ— DuckDuckGo (@DuckDuckGo) July 14, 2025\n\nThe filter relies on manually curated open-source block lists maintained by uBlockOrigin and others. According to DuckDuckGo, the filter won't catch every AI-generated image out on the internet, but it will greatly reduce how many you see. The company says it's working on additional filters.  \nYou'll notice the example DuckDuckGo uses to demo the feature in the GIF it provided involves a search for images of a \"baby peacock.\" That's not by accident. People first started noticing how much Google Search results had been overrun by AI slop about a year ago, and one of the worst examples was any query involving the showy birds. Google has since addressed the situation somewhat, but AI slop in search results remain a problem on the platform. So it's good to see DuckDuckGo adopt a simple but effective solution to the issue. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/duckduckgo-now-allows-you-to-filter-out-ai-images-in-search-results-144326213.html?src=rss",
