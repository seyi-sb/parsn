    "summary": "Spotify is expanding access to audiobooks with two new plans, one of which offers access to family members.",
    "full_text": "Spotify on Thursday announced an expansion of its premium audiobooks service, with two new plans that offer additional listening hours to subscribers, and allow other family members to access the service. U.S. users could already purchase 15 hours of listening as a standalone offering through an Audiobooks Access Plan, but these additions make it possible for those in other markets to customize their access to their own needs. Today, Spotify’s Premium plans include 15 hours of audiobook listening, so this new plan doubles that offering, ensuring subscribers can get through longer books or even a couple of shorter ones in the month. The other new plan, Audiobooks+ for Plan Members, will be an even more welcome addition for those who want to share access to audiobooks: Members on Premium Family and Duo plans will be able to access 15 hours of monthly audiobook listening, too. Similar plans will later arrive in the U.S., Spotify told TechCrunch. To use the feature, plan members will first request audiobook access from their plan manager, who purchases the new add-on. A spokesperson said that users in those markets can visit the Spotify.com/audiobooks page to learn more. One major publisher, HarperCollins, noted in December that Spotify was working to bring audiobooks to other family members on shared plans. At a conference, HarperCollins CEO Brian Murra said that the market had potential for further growth as Spotify was at the time working out a “technical issue” with family plans that limited audiobooks to the plan’s credit card holder. The streaming service sees AI as another opportunity for expansion, saying in last quarter’s earnings that it was working with Eleven Labs to get more books narrated, including translating texts from English to other languages."

    "summary": "Jack Dorsey has been back in the news lately after unveiling a pair of new apps he worked on, Bluetooth-based messenager Bitchat and UV exposure tracker Sun Day. The Block CEO put those together under the auspices of a new development collective called \"and Other Stuff,\" a nonprofit that he is backing with a $10 million cash injection through his StartSmall foundation, as TechCrunch reports.\nThe group plans to work on open-source projects, including ones that could become consumer social media apps, along with app-development tools. The developers met on Nostr, a social networking protocol Dorsey has also backed financially. \nThe \"and Other Stuff\" collective aims to support Nostr's \"transition from an experimental protocol to a widely adopted, sustainable ecosystem through collaborative growth and funding.\" In addition to Nostr projects, the collaborators plan to experiment with building tools based on the likes of ActivityPub — which powers Mastodon — and Cashu. That e-cash platform's creator, dubbed Calle, is part of the \"and other Stuff\" team alongside Twitter’s first employee, Evan Henshaw-Plath.\nThe projects that \"and Other Stuff\" has worked on so far include voice note app heynow, a private messenger app called White Noise and social community +chorus. They have also created Shakespeare, which is designed to help developers build Nostr-based social apps with AI.\nDorsey has long fostered an interest in open-source protocols. In 2019, during his second stint as Twitter CEO, the company set up a team that was tasked with forming an open, decentralized standard for social media. Dorsey had hoped to eventually shift Twitter onto that protocol, but of course that didn't pan out. Instead, Twitter spun out that project — Bluesky — as a public benefit corporation in 2022. Last year, after leaving Bluesky's board, Dorsey claimed that the team there was \"literally repeating all the mistakes\" he made while running Twitter such as, uh, setting up moderation tools (which are, in reality, a critically important aspect of any successful social platform).\nOn an episode of Henshaw-Plath's new podcast, Dorsey reiterated a point he had made previously, that Twitter was beholden to advertisers (an issue that X is contending with under Elon Musk's ownership). \"It’s hard for something like [Twitter] to be a company, because you have corporate incentives when it wants to be a protocol,\" Dorsey said. \"If [Twitter] were an open protocol, if it were truly an open project, you could build a business on top of it, and you could build a very healthy business on top of it.\"\nHe was also once again critical of Bluesky's structure, adding that, \"I want to push the energy in a different direction... which is more like Bitcoin, which is completely open and not owned by anyone from a protocol layer. That’s what I see in Nostr as well. That’s where I want to push my energy... rather into the more corporate direction, even if it is a public benefit corporation.\"This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/jack-dorsey-backs-an-open-source-development-collective-with-10-million-140052825.html?src=rss",

I might have a lot more time on my hands, so it’s not actually going to stop the regular browsing. So what we plan to do is actually publish a lot of the early use cases on educational material and have it be widely accessible. The same issues exist with OpenAI’s Operator, which tries to create server-side versions of all your apps. And whether it would be possible for a new platform to build traffic from scratch by just doing the good old SEO tricks, I’m actually bearish on that. I just want to go and browse Verge without actually having any question in my mind, that’s fine. So it’s actually pretty contingent on the business and not just guaranteed payouts, but still huge numbers.

    "full_text": "The concept of a gritty reboot of Pac-Man first reared its strange head in Secret Level, an anthology that turned notable video games into animated shorts that mostly felt like extended commercials. And that’s exactly what the episode “Circle,” which reimagined Pac-Man as a blood-soaked survival story, turned out to be. For those who didn’t watch Secret Level, Shadow Labyrinth puts you in the role of an unnamed, hooded swordmaster, who awakens to find himself inside some sort of dark alien labyrinth. The twisting, maze-like map is full of dead ends that you can’t explore until you get the right ability, which include staples like a double jump and grappling hook. Scattered throughout the labyrinth are rails that Puck can ride on, sort of like Pac-Man moving his way through a classic arcade maze. The game is at its best when you’re quickly swapping between Puck and the swordmaster, either to navigate a tricky platforming sequence or defeat enemies. In one early boss battle, I was able to use a rail on the ceiling to avoid projectiles, and then drop behind the enemy for some quick sneak attacks. Early on, Puck and the swordmaster gain the ability to temporarily fuse together to create a power-up that’s sort of like a mech suit, which you can use to devastate most enemies and even avoid environmental hazards. Oh, and when you’re a mech, you can eat your enemies to gain materials needed for those important unlocks. Secret Level may have been a commercial, but it was a pretty poor one: it missed what actually makes Shadow Labyrinth worth playing."

Gauthier Andres, a reporter and co-founder at Origami, was first to report the news, which the studio later confirmed. Virtuos has provided support on a number of large game projects — including a recent patch for Cyberpunk 2077 — and employs more than 4,200 people across the US, Europe and Asia.\nThe company said the layoffs are primarily affecting \"teams facing lower occupancy and slower demand due to structural shifts in the industry.\" It's firing around 200 people in Asia and approximately 70 in Europe. \"Fewer than 10\" of those are in France, where the core team working on Oblivion Remastered is based. Virtuos says it's offering affected workers layoff packages, career transition assistance and, \"where possible,\" job opportunities across its network. \n\"Over the past 12 months, Virtuos has deepened its commitment to premium co-development through key acquisitions of Beyond-FX, Pipeworks, and Umanaïa in North America, as well as Third Kind Games and Abstraction in Europe,\" Virtuos said in a statement. \"These studios enhance our strengths in VFX, design, Unreal Engine programming and creative development. This ongoing investment reflects our intent to grow in areas where our expertise and scale create lasting value, while selectively exiting service segments where demand is weakening. We need to better match the locations of our teams with those of our clients to support the increasingly iterative nature of creative co-development. This alignment is why the current reorganization has a greater impact on our teams in Asia.\"\nBesides reviving Bethesda classics, Virtuos has contributed work to the upcoming Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater and several ongoing live service games, like Dune: Awakening  and Sea of Thieves. Nothing about the company's output or the critical reception of its games would suggest it needs to conduct layoffs, but that reflects the current precarious state of the games industry. Even having theoretically steady work doing post-release support and game remasters isn't enough.\nVirtuos' layoffs follows the sweeping cuts Microsoft made to its Xbox division in early July. Microsoft reportedly cancelled games, like Rare's long-in-development Everwild, and shutdown whole studios, like The Initiative.

    "summary": "Stellantis, the automotive giant behind Chrysler, Citroen, Fiat, Jeep and Peugeot, is pulling out of hydrogen. The company said it’s killing its fuel cell development program in the face of  “limited availability of hydrogen refueling infrastructure, high capital requirements and the need for stronger consumer purchasing incentives.” To put that another way, it’s realized hydrogen EVs are facing the same set of challenges it’s not been able to overcome in the last two or three decades.\nIt’s a stark shift in tone from January 2024, when the company promised to roll out a fleet of commercial fuel cell vehicles. Stellantis sells many of Europe’s most popular panel vans including the Citroen Jumper, Fiat Ducato, Opel Movano and Peugeot Boxer. Back then, it said we’d see hydrogen versions of all those vehicles (as well as its smaller siblings) with maximum ranges of 500km (310 miles).\nThe decision to pull the plug came relatively late, with the company saying it was due to begin production at its plants in France and Poland “this summer.” It added the decision to kill the range will not impact staffing in production or R&D, with employees transferred to other projects. It will, however, have to delicately negotiate its exit with Symbio, the fuel cell maker it bought a one-third share of back in 2023.\nStellantis isn’t the first company that pledged to put its weight behind fuel cells only to pull back. Toyota has thrown a lot of time, effort and money behind hydrogen, believing fuel cells would be preferable to battery electric vehicles (BEVs). Sadly, as time progressed, the company has had to cede more and more of the market to batteries, and only advertises its third-generation fuel cell as a power unit for heavy industrial vehicles.\nHydrogen was, and has been for some time, an article of faith for fossil fuel companies, the car industry and even some countries that lack their own energy reserves. After all, the promise of being able to pull (theoretically limitless), emission-free energy out of water is the stuff of dreams. Not to mention, it requires much of the same knowledge and infrastructure used by the traditional oil and gas industry, and refueling can only take place at a commercial site.\nHad hydrogen made more of an impact, it would have likely preserved the status quo or something much like it, for those industries long into the future. But while the hope was that hydrogen could be a cleaner, greener substitute for oil and gas, its inherent flaws always made that a non-starter.\nFor instance, hydrogen is far less energy dense than oil and gas, and far less physically dense — it’s so prone to leaking that you have to go above and beyond to seal it in. It’s difficult to mass produce cleanly, especially if you want to power every car in the world, unless you use a dirty process like the steam reformation of methane. So, rather than moving away from fossil fuels and emissions, you’d be further entrenching them into the system and adding to the problem.\nAnd if you did want to just use renewable energy to pull hydrogen from water, then you’d require an unprecedented amount of investment. Back in 2021, I asked Tim Lord, who had previously been in charge of the UK’s decarbonization strategy, about that sort of industrial-scale hydrogen generation. He said that you’d essentially need to double your whole electricity generation output to get close.\nThat’s before you get to the other factors, like hydrogen’s efficiency as a store of energy or the investment necessary to equip every gas station on the planet with a hydrogen tank. Which is not likely going to pay off given that Toyota’s Mirai, arguably the flagship hydrogen fuel cell EV, has only sold 28,000 models since its launch in 2014. In the US market, there's only the Mirai, the Hyundai Nexo and the Honda CR-V e-FCEV knocking around, nothing compared to how many BEVs are on sale. I think it’s time for everyone to admit that we’re done with hydrogen fuel cell EVs and focus their attention elsewhere.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/another-big-car-company-gives-up-on-hydrogen-133011978.html?src=rss",

Research has linked skin issues like acne and psoriasis to the gut. Studies are also looking into how gut biome impacts reproductive health and hormone levels. Bearing that in mind, here are four things you can do to help keep it on the right track. Some common side effects of taking antibiotics include nausea, diarrhea and developing yeast infections. In addition to incorporating more yogurt or fermented foods into their diet, some people may seek a probiotic in hopes of balancing their gut, as they're designed to mimic an intact microbiota. Whole grains, fruits and vegetables are great food choices if you want to start healing your gut. If you dread running or don't have time to go to the gym, don't worry: There are small ways you can get your body in the habit of moving every day or at least more frequently.

Unrelenting dedication to smallness has been a long-standing issue of mine with Sony cameras. It’s why I personally own and use Sony Alpha cameras, even for paid gigs. But if I was choosing based on handling and comfort (which are important, especially when you’re sometimes shooting for 10-hour days), I would have stuck with Nikon or Canon. I’ll commend Sony for making some inroads in the ergonomics department with its A9 III and A1 II cameras. They have deeper grips that are definitely better, and it’s partly why I upgraded my A9 II to a III. I know part of the RX1’s ethos is putting a lot of camera into a very small package, even smaller than the incredibly popular Fujifilm X100VI, but it’s not like these are pocket-sized cameras. It’s no different than how I handle my Leica Q2, which is noticeably bigger. The Q2 is also a more ergonomically friendly camera to use than the RX1 and RX1R II, which I tried years back during my days working at a camera store. Meanwhile, Leica compromised slightly on its formerly-immaculate design when it fitted the Q3 with a bare-minimum tilt screen."

    "summary": "Since rolling out the redesign of its Firefly app in April, Adobe has been releasing major updates for the generative AI hub at a near monthly clip. Today, the company is introducing a handful of new features to assist those who use Firefly's video capabilities.\nTo start, Adobe is making it easier to add sound effects to AI-generated clips. Right now, the majority of video models create footage without any accompanying audio. Adobe is addressing this with a nifty little feature that allows users to first describe the sound effect they want to generate and then record themselves making it. The second part isn't so Adobe's model can mimic the sound. Rather, it's so the system can get a better idea of the intensity and timing the user wants from the effect.\nIn the demo Adobe showed me, one of the company's employees used the feature to add the sound of a zipper being unzipped. They made a \"zzzztttt\" sound, which Adobe's model faithfully used to reproduce the effect at the intended volume. The translation was less convincing when the employee used the tool to add the sound of footsteps on concrete, though if you're using the feature for ideation as Adobe intended, that may not matter. When adding sound effects, there's a timeline editor along the bottom of the interface to make it easy to time the audio properly.\nAdobe\nThe other new features Adobe is adding today are called Composition Reference, Keyframe Cropping and Video Presets. The first of those allows you to upload a video or image you captured to guide the generation process. In combination with Video Presets, you can define the style of the final output. Some of the options Adobe is offering at launch allow you to create clips with anime, black and white or vector art styles. Lastly, with Keyframe Cropping you can upload the first and final frame of a video and select an aspect ratio. Firefly will then generate a video that stays within your desired format.\nIn June, Adobe added support for additional third-party models, and this month it's doing the same. Most notable is the inclusion of Veo 3, which Google premiered at its I/O 2025 conference in May. At the moment, Veo 3 is one of the only AI models that can generate video with sound. Like with all the other partner models Adobe offers in Firefly, Google has agreed not to use data from Adobe users for training future models. Every image and video people create through Firefly is digitally signed with the model that was used to create it. That is one of the safeguards Adobe includes so that Firefly customers don't accidentally ship an asset that infringes on copyrighted material.\nAccording to Zeke Koch, vice president of product management for Adobe Firefly, users can expect the fast pace of updates to continue. \"We're relentlessly shipping stuff almost as quickly as we can,\" he said. Koch adds Adobe will continue to integrate more third-party models, as long as their providers agree to the company's data privacy terms.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/adobe-firefly-can-now-generate-sound-effects-from-your-audio-cues-130008172.html?src=rss",

    "full_text": "Over a decade in, the ambitions of A24 and Aster have expanded beyond genre film. In a fictional New Mexican town, Sheriff Joe Cross (Phoenix) is unhappy about statewide COVID-19 precautions. In some ways, watching the first hour of Eddington feels a bit like watching a Wes Anderson movie or maybe Yorgos Lanthimos’ cruel triptych Kinds of Kindness. The delights come from watching a bunch of recognizable actors inhabit and bounce off odd characters. (You get the sense that they had a good time on set, too.) Two other teenage characters begin protesting mostly because they think she’s hot. For all its themes, the early parts of Eddington are light on moralizing or righteousness. If the idea is obvious, at least Aster pulls it off convincingly. Maybe five years isn’t enough time to understand what exactly the pandemic did to us as individuals or as a society, but I think anyone would suspect that it’s more complicated than “it broke our brains.” If nothing else, Eddington proves that that reasoning is deeply boring on a narrative level. You just wish that same effort had been put into any of the film’s ideas."

    "full_text": "Adobe is launching new generative AI filmmaking tools that provide fun ways to create sound effects and control generated video outputs. Alongside the familiar text prompts that typically allow you to describe what Adobe’s Firefly AI models should make or edit, users can now use onomatopoeia-like voice recordings to generate custom sounds, and use reference footage to guide the movements in Firefly-generated videos. The Generate Sound Effects tool that’s launching in beta on the Firefly app can be used with recorded and generated footage, and provides greater control over audio generation than Google’s Veo 3 video tool. The interface resembles a video editing timeline and allows users to match the effects they create in time with uploaded footage. For example, users can play a video of a horse walking along a road and simultaneously record “clip clop” noises in time with its hoof steps, alongside a text description that says “hooves on concrete.” The tool will then generate four sound effect options to choose from. This builds on the Project Super Sonic experiment that Adobe showed off at its Max event in October. New advanced controls are also coming to the Firefly Text-to-Video generator. Here are a few of the style preset examples to help guide Adobe’s AI video generation outputs. These style presets are only available to use with Adobe’s own Firefly video AI model. But Adobe is continuing to add support for rival AI models within its own tools, and Adobe’s Generative AI lead Alexandru Costin told The Verge that similar controls and presets may be available to use with third-party AI models in the future."

Firmness is rated numerically on a scale of 1 (the softest) to 10 (the firmest), and we use industry terms such as soft or medium-firm to describe it. Our entire team takes turns assessing and ranking the firmness of each mattress, which allows us to make suggestions about which sleeping position and body type it best suits. Another subjective element we review is the feel of a mattress, separate from its firmness. Temperature can be tricky to review when considering each sleeper's personal preferences and the fact that many mattress brands exaggerate their beds' cooling capabilities. When testing and reviewing mattresses, we detail how hot or cool the mattress sleeps. ), so we test the beds in temperature-controlled rooms without sheets or bedding. Motion isolation is a term we use to describe how well the mattress deadens movement across its surface. We test its motion isolation capabilities by having one expert lie on the bed while another flops around and switches positions."

    "summary": "After several generations of iterative updates, it feels like Samsung tossed the Galaxy Z Fold 7 into a Hyperbolic Time Chamber to create a stunning device that's leaner, stronger and more powerful than before. The best part though is the phone looks and functions just like a regular handset now that there’s less bulk to lug around. But at a moment's notice, it can go Super Saiyan by opening up to reveal an even larger 8-inch display to become a true multimedia Raidboss. Unfortunately, it's still extremely expensive at $2,000. Though if you can handle the price, in a lot of ways, Samsung has finally achieved foldable phone nirvana with the Galaxy Z Fold 7.\nDesign: Chef's kiss\nWhen Samsung debuted its updated super sleek design language on the Galaxy S25 Edge, it felt like a novel way to reimagine the S25+ as a more engaging device. But when the company gave the same treatment to the Z Fold 7, that engineering became something truly transformative. Compared to its predecessor, Samsung's big foldable for 2025 is 10 percent lighter at just 215 grams. The bigger drop comes in thickness with Galaxy Z Fold 7 measuring a whopping 26 percent thinner (just 8.9mm when folded). This represents the biggest generation-over-generation decrease for the entire Z Fold line, which is kind of shocking considering it's happening seven years in. The result is a foldable that is basically the same size and weight as the Galaxy S25 Ultra (it's actually a little narrower), which is no mean feat for a class of gadgets that has been plagued by extra heft since they first came out. \n\n\nWhat might be just as impressive is that Samsung hasn't really cut corners to deliver the Z Fold 7's streamlined dimensions. You still get an IP48 rating for dust and water resistance (which can handle submersions of up to 5 feet for 30 minutes) along with Gorilla Glass Ceramic 2 in front and Gorilla Glass Victus 2 in back. Samsung also completely re-engineered its Armor FlexHinge, which glides open and closed like a dream. Samsung even says that Z Fold 7's ultra-thin glass is 50 percent thicker than before while also sporting a new titanium lattice that adds additional support and durability to the phone's flexible display.\nInside, Samsung has switched away from the under-display sensor used on previous models in favor of a more traditional hole-punch camera. This is a bit of a shame as it adds a small blemish to that otherwise gorgeous screen. However, with the panel now measuring 8 inches across (up from 7.6 on the Z Fold 6), there's more of it to enjoy even after you account for the small cutout. Plus, the move to a higher-res 10-megapixel sensor for this camera results in significantly better image quality than any of Samsung's under-display modules.\n\n\n\n\n  Sam Rutherford for Engadget\n \n\nThe one small design quirk is that sometimes the phone doesn't unfold all the way, often stopping just short at 179 degrees — much like the original Pixel Fold. That said, you can always make it go fully flat with a bit of extra pressure, though most of the time I don't even bother because this is the kind of thing that you don't really notice unless you're specifically looking for it.\nDisplays: Now even bigger, both inside and out\nAs for brightness and image quality, Samsung's panels are still unmatched. In addition to a larger main display, the Z Fold 7's exterior Cover Screen is slightly bigger at 6.5 inches. More importantly, it's noticeably wider too while sporting even thinner bezels, which makes the whole phone feel more usable. The feeling of holding a skinny baton I got on previous models is completely gone. Both screens also support a 120Hz refresh rate and can hit a peak brightness of 2,600 nits. And when compared to rivals like the Pixel 9 Pro Fold, the Fold 7's displays just pop a touch more thanks to slightly richer colors and saturation.\n\n\n\n\n  Sam Rutherford for Engadget\n \n\nAfter introducing S Pen integration on the Z Fold 3, Samsung has removed stylus support for this model — a big downgrade that may anger longtime Z Fold fans. The company claims it made this decision after seeing \"very low\" S Pen usage on previous generations, which frankly isn't all that surprising. But, as one of the highlight features that separated Samsung's big foldables from practically all of its rivals, it's still sad to see it go.\nPerformance and software: The fastest big foldable phone\nThe Galaxy Z Fold 7 unquestionably packs top-tier performance. It's powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chip along with 12GB or 16GB of RAM and up to 1TB of storage. Everything feels fast and snappy while OneUI 8 and Android 16 bring app optimizations that help make the most of the phone's big display.\n\n\n\n\n  Sam Rutherford for Engadget\n \n\nThe biggest eye-opener for me was when I compared how long it took the Z Fold 7 to launch my current favorite mobile game, Sword of Convallaria, against the Pixel 9 Pro Fold. Even with the increased performance of Google's recent Tensor chips, Samsung's foldable loaded the game in 13 seconds compared to 18 seconds for the Pixel. That might not sound like a ton, but it’s around 25 percent faster and when it's something you do multiple times a day, shaving off even a few seconds adds up fast..\nCameras: A major resolution bump\nWhile the Z Fold 7's ultrawide and 3x telephoto cameras are largely unchanged, the phone features a big photo upgrade thanks to a new 200MP sensor for its main camera. This is essentially the same component Samsung used in the S25 Ultra and S25 Edge, and it delivers a much-needed bump in image quality.\n\n\n\n\n  Sam Rutherford for Engadget\n \n\nIn bright light, the Z Fold 7 easily keeps pace with the Pixel 9 Pro Fold. In certain situations like when snapping pics of food, some may prefer its shots thanks to Samsung's warmer color profile. The phone still tends to oversharpen things, but colors are vibrant. For those who want to maximize resolution, you can select the phone's full 200MP mode (images are captured at 12MP by default). At night, the Fold 7's shots remained surprisingly sharp. I still prefer the Pixel 9 Pro Fold due to its more accurate white balance and often sharper focus, though Samsung's phone isn't far behind.\nPotentially the biggest shortcoming on the Fold 7 is that its 3x optical zoom can't quite match the 5x telephoto cam on the Pixel 9 Pro Fold. But for fans of group shots, Samsung added a new selfie camera with a wider 100-degree field of view.\nBattery life and charging: Solid longevity, but still only Qi 2 ready\nWhile the Z Fold 7's 4,400mAh battery is the same size as its predecessor, you will get slightly increased longevity due to improved power efficiency from its processor. In our local video rundown test, the Z Fold 7 lasted 20 hours and 50 minutes when using its main 8-inch display and 26 hours and 22 minutes with its exterior screen. Depending on which display you use, that's between 45 minutes and an hour longer than what we got from the previous model, which is nice to see considering battery life was already pretty solid.\n\n\n\n\n  Sam Rutherford for Engadget\n \n\nSadly, Samsung hasn't changed much when it comes to recharging. The Z Fold 7 supports wired charging at up to 25 watts — which is rather average for a modern flagship — alongside 15 watt wireless charging. And like the rest of the 2025 premium Galaxy line, this phone is merely Qi 2 ready, which means there's no built-in attachment system for magnetic accessories like charging pucks, card holders and battery packs. So if you want to use peripherals like those, you'll need to get a case with full support for Qi 2.\nWrap-up\nI've always said that Samsung is at its best when it focuses on hardware design, and the Galaxy Z Fold 7 may be one of the best examples of that. With its latest flagship foldable, Samsung has removed one of the remaining barriers preventing people from trying out the new breed of phones: excessive size and weight.\nBy widening its cover display, the Z Fold 7 looks and acts just like a regular smartphone, which is great for checking messages, looking up directions or snapping a photo. When you want to get really immersed in a show, movie or game, you can open up that beautiful flexible display, which is now even larger for your viewing pleasure. The phone’s higher-res main camera also brings upgraded image quality while its Snapdragon 8 Elite chip gives it a performance edge over rivals like the Pixel 9 Pro Fold.\n\n\n\n\n  Sam Rutherford for Engadget\n \n\nI don't love how Samsung is backtracking on features by removing S Pen support and reverting to an old-school camera cutout instead of an under-display sensor for its main display. But at least in the case of the latter, that change comes with much improved image quality, which is a big upgrade for video calls.\nWith the Galaxy Z Fold 7, you really do get the best of both worlds. Its new design is just as sleek as comparable traditional flagships while hiding a larger display that makes the need for small tablets obsolete. Unfortunately, with a starting price of $2,000, Samsung hasn't addressed the last roadblock stopping people from trying out a device that might completely change the way they use their phone.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review-foldable-phone-nirvana-for-a-price-123004636.html?src=rss",
    "full_text": "Compared to its predecessor, Samsung's big foldable for 2025 is 10 percent lighter at just 215 grams. The bigger drop comes in thickness with Galaxy Z Fold 7 measuring a whopping 26 percent thinner (just 8.9mm when folded). What might be just as impressive is that Samsung hasn't really cut corners to deliver the Z Fold 7's streamlined dimensions. Inside, Samsung has switched away from the under-display sensor used on previous models in favor of a more traditional hole-punch camera. Plus, the move to a higher-res 10-megapixel sensor for this camera results in significantly better image quality than any of Samsung's under-display modules. In addition to a larger main display, the Z Fold 7's exterior Cover Screen is slightly bigger at 6.5 inches.

    "full_text": "His work has appeared in The New York Daily News and City & State. Uber plans to make “multi-hundred-million dollar investments” in both Nuro and Lucid as part of a massive new robotaxi deal that was just announced. This is Nuro’s first major licensing deal after pivoting away from designing and building its own self-driving delivery vehicles. Donald Trump’s tariffs, as well as his administration’s move to eliminate Biden-era EV incentives, have put enormous pressure on the auto industry. But even as most AV investments have dried up, Nuro continues to find financial support. Uber’s investment comes at a crucial time for Nuro and Lucid. A prototype autonomous Gravity is currently being tested at Nuro’s Las Vegas proving grounds, which Ferguson said took seven weeks to develop. Level 4 vehicles can driver fully autonomously in certain environments without human supervision. Nuro has been operating driverless vehicles for several years now, albeit at low speeds and while avoiding highways. But he says the time is right to move on to the next level, and with Uber and Lucid in its corner, he’s confident they’ll reach these milestones."

The idea is to save the user time by avoiding having to manually look up these terms or bug a colleague for an explanation. It can also provide a full transcript for Slack huddle meetings and highlight the key points raised. Slack is also introducing AI profile summaries that provide a quick overview of another user’s role and recent contributions to give users context about unfamiliar teammates at a glance. All of the features mentioned above are in the pipeline, but Slack hasn’t specified when they will be available. Slack has announced that two other features are now generally available, however.

While clip-on earbuds first started appearing in Asia several months (or even longer) before the Ultra Open Earbuds were released, Bose not only vastly improved upon the design and performance of early clip-on models, but it also did a bang-up job marketing them as a \"totally new kind of wearable device.\" When I asked Anker's PR rep about how it developed its products, he came back with: \"We respectfully decline to comment.\" As a reviewer, it gets even trickier when the specs of two models from competing brands look nearly identical. Based in Kawasaki City, Japan, Final Audio is geared toward audiophiles and specializes in earphones and headphones that range from its flagship $4,000 D8000 planar magnetic open-back headphones to those aforementioned entry-level ZE3000 SV buds that are priced near the top of the \"budget\" range at $100. Final saved tons of R&D cost here, and is obviously having a greater profit margin than Roseselsa. This setup benefited factories, as they could sell the same package to multiple brands and recoup development costs more easily. But my travels through this world have taught me that there's more nuance and variation to product development than I thought."

    "full_text": "This category features about 35 titles, all offering some take on multifaceted women. There are also a bunch of movies on the list, including Amy Schumer's pregnancy comedy Kinda Pregnant, Todd Haynes' psychological drama May December and the rom-com He's All That. \"Messy Girl Summer\" is a broad term evoking female characters who are allowed to be flawed, weird, vulnerable or secretive -- and that's a combination of traits that has worked for Netflix for years. Netflix really could have blown this category out and had some fun with it. Also missing from Netflix's list are the documentary Sweet Bobby: My Catfish Nightmare, about one woman's years-long relationship with a man who didn't exist, the kinda-weird Irish crime drama Bodkin, the Japanese series Asura about four sisters whose lives are thrown into chaos when their dad's affair is discovered, or the Mexican erotic drama Playing With Fire. Every woman on each of these shows is a mess or is dealing with one in some way or another; they absolutely deserve to be included. Nothing messier than One of Them Days (friendship/rent is due mess), To All The Boys I've Loved Before (romantic mess), or documentaries like Con Mum or A Deadly American Marriage (real-life mess). I'm all for trendy, zeitgeisty slang (if for no other reason than to make my kids uncomfortable when I use it), so messy girl summer doesn't bother me, but it did make me realize that when you're labeling women, messy is an easy shorthand for the Venn overlap of \"flawed\" and \"chaotic.\" For shows about men like that, I suggest Dept. Honestly, you can shoehorn pretty much anything into a category if you try -- we all contain multitudes and we're all a mess somehow, right?"

I also needed to shoot video on this trip, both for the CNET video that would run alongside my article, and to capture content for my personal photography YouTube channel. Sure, maybe the footage wasn't as cinematic as I'd normally try to achieve from my usual Canon R5, but it looked more than good enough and the DJI setup was far easier to carry around with me than a full-size mirrorless camera and lenses. That wasn't a problem, and I'm especially pleased with some of my imagery taken inside the company's battery testing area, which was a key subject of my written piece. Things got more dramatic as I joined Volvo in the frozen north of Sweden. It was amazing, especially when we stopped and got a brief glimpse of the northern lights overhead. I'd attached my DJI Osmo on a small clamp inside the car to film my efforts from multiple angles, but then it was time for me to do something a bit more dangerous. But that's fine, I needed only a few to illustrate my story. I shot many of the images on this trip using Leica's built-in Chrome color profile. Fujifilm's cameras (like the excellent X100VI) are famed for having a variety of stunning filmlike color profiles built in, so look toward those if you're keen on using in-camera colors."

The 2015 film from writer-director George Miller is set in a post-apocalyptic desert and is essentially a non-stop battle sequence where hero Max Rockatansky (Tom Hardy) teams up with Theron's Imperator Furiosa to wage battle against warlord Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne) and his army. You might want to catch Horizon: An American Saga -- Chapter One now; it's leaving Netflix July 15. After reconnecting, the two friends explore their friendship and wonder what might have been had Nora never left. Grug doesn't always welcome learning new things from a human and Eep's curious, sometimes rebellious ways also contribute to family disagreements. 20th Century Pictures Heat (1995) Michael Mann's 1995 movie Heat is most famous for being the first film in which acting titans Al Pacino and Robert De Niro appeared on screen in a scene together but it also features a fantastic performance from the late, great Val Kilmer. Taylour Paige, Colman Domingo and Glynn Turman all co-star in the film that was adapted from August Wilson's 1982 play. Rustin's outspoken activism and homosexuality made him a target -- not just for political adversaries but sometimes even among his allies. After surviving an encounter with Godzilla, he and others realize the kaiju is gearing up to attack Tokyo. (It feels impossible to imagine so many mega-stars assembling in one room for something like this today.)"

But just engineering a foldable phone isn't enough these days -- it has to be slim. And in this respect, Tecno is trying to thin the field. By contrast, the Huawei Mate XT Ultimate is 3.6mm at its thinnest point, and Samsung's latest two-panel Galaxy Z Fold 7 is 4.2mm thick when unfolded. When folded, Tecno's device measures 11.49mm, making it thinner than the Huawei's at 12.88mm but still chunky compared to non-folding phones like the iPhone 16 Pro (8.25mm) or the single-fold Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 (8.9mm). Thanks to a dual-cam design, that large hinge can be set in a partially folded configuration, presumably propping it up to do things like watch content or take video calls. That's pretty good for most phones, but it's unclear how much power will be siphoned by that big 9.49-inch display in regular use. When looking at the Mate XT Ultimate last year, CNET's Sareena Dayaram felt that its 5,600-mAh battery could be an issue due to the large inner screen. While the latest mobile silicon can handle multiple screens, we'll wait to see if the Ultimate G Fold can run apps well with its unique display system. There's also no anticipated price or shipping target; Tecno expects to showcase it at Mobile World Congress 2026."

The company is rolling out a new \"age estimation\" feature for teens 13 and older.\nWith the update, teens will be prompted for an age check that requires a video selfie in order to access its new less restrictive chat feature called \"trusted connections.\" Roblox is relying on third-party identity company Persona for the actual \"estimation,\" and users who fail the check will also have the option of providing an ID. Once teens have \"unlocked\" trusted connections via video selfie or sharing an ID, they'll be able to participate in chats with friends \"without filters,\" including \"party\" group text and voice chats.\nRoblox has previously faced scrutiny for not policing its chat features enough and making it too easy for adults to seek out children on the platform. The company notes in its announcement that parents will be able to monitor their kids' \"trusted connections\" via parental control features, and that the feature is intended only for people who teens already \"know and trust.\" Teens are only able to add trusted connections via their existing contacts list or a QR code.\n\"We believe chat without filters should only be accessible to users who have verified their age.\" the company writes in a blog post. \"This isn’t just about compliance; it’s about building engaging and appropriate digital spaces for everyone.\"\nWhile Roblox is notably not using the term \"age verification,\" the new feature comes at a time when there are increasing calls for social media companies and other platforms to check the ages of their youngest users. Reddit and Bluesky recently announced age verification features for users in the UK  — a change required of major platforms ahead of a new online safety law going into effect.

Utah also recently passed a law requiring app stores to verify users' ages — an approach that has been endorsed by companies like Meta and Snap. And the Supreme Court recently upheld a Texas law that requires websites hosting adult to conduct age verification checks.\nRoblox, which unlike most online platforms allows children under 13 to have accounts, is in a slightly different position.

The platform is renaming Friends to Connections, and people can only use unfiltered text chat and the Party social feature with a more exclusive group of “Trusted Connections.” With Trusted Connections, “inappropriate language like ‘butt-head’ and personally identifiable information are not filtered,” spokesperson Juliet Chaitin-Lefcourt tells The Verge. Roblox partnered with identity verification company Persona on the age estimation technology, Roblox’s Ryan Ebanks said in a call with reporters, and he says biometric data will be deleted 30 days after collection “except for a few exceptions where legally required.” Persona is “providing the core age estimation and ID verification services to Roblox,” Chaitin-Lefcourt says, and “Persona’s model is integrated into the Roblox app with additional UI and logic that has been customized by Roblox.” Users 13 through 17 who have their age confirmed will be able to add each other as Trusted Connections. Teens will only be able to add someone older than 18 as a Trusted Connection if they know them in real life, Kaufman says, and they can do that by scanning a QR code in person or using Roblox’s Contact Importer feature. Although chats with Trusted Connections can be unfiltered, Roblox will monitor the conversations for “critical harm.” Roblox is also introducing new features intended to support users’ well-being. A new option will let people control who sees whether they’re online. Update, July 17th: Roblox confirmed what isn’t filtered with Trusted Connections."

Watch out One of the biggest trade-offs for most CDs is early withdrawal penalties. And that's not counting the interest you'll earn on top of your savings. Although savings accounts have variable interest rates -- meaning they can rise and fall based on the economy and your bank's discretion -- experts expect savings rates will remain high all year. Right now, you can earn up to 5% APY with some high-yield savings accounts. Focus on what you can contribute and get into the habit of saving so it becomes a routine."

Essentials Saver and Essentials don't carry the five-year price guarantee found in the Experience plans, nor does it include T-Satellite texting access, but you can add the Starlink-based service as an optional add-on when it launches on July 23.

The Essentials Saver plan costs $50 a month for a single line, $80 for two lines and $100 for three lines, the maximum number allowed on this plan.

    "full_text": "When it comes to your home internet connection, there's one question we get asked quite a bit: Does Wi-Fi travel through walls? Your router wirelessly exchanges data with other devices nearby through radio waves, which use electromagnetic radiation. According to ScienceABC, electromagnetic waves can pass through a surface; this process is called refraction. In some cases, you may not need to take a dramatic step like getting rid of your router. If there are two or more antennas on your router, don’t position them all in the same direction. If that still doesn't make a difference, try experimenting with placing the antennas at several different angles. During this process, run several internet speed tests to note the differences with each antenna configuration. (Disclosure: Ookla is owned by the same parent company as CNET, Ziff Davis.) In addition, there are other drastic measures you can take to really improve your home internet connection. Investing in a quality network switch (Smart Managed or Fully Managed switches) may come with a steep price tag, but the benefits from using one could be worth the price: You can expect faster speeds, increased security and more control over your network."

If you deal with long periods of stress -- caused by factors like a high-pressure job, financial struggles or family responsibilities -- Shmouni says that cortisol can stay elevated in the body instead of fluctuating normally throughout the day. If you had trouble sleeping last night and are dealing with high stress at work, it may not be the best time for an intense workout. In addition to a high-sugar diet, alcohol and caffeine can also affect cortisol levels.

Some systems, like the HP Reverb G2, must connect to a PC, while others like the PS VR2 can connect to gaming consoles like the PS5. Most VR headsets come with the basic controllers you'll need to control actions and movement in virtual worlds. \nWhat's the difference between PC VR, Smartphone VR and Gaming Console VR?\nThe main difference between those three VR systems is the main machine that allows the VR headset to run. PC VR headsets require a PC, like a gaming laptop or desktop, to run, while smartphone and gaming console VR systems require smartphones and gaming consoles, respectively, to work.\nDo all VR headsets need a phone?\nNo, not all VR headsets need a phone to work. Many VR headsets have build in displays that sit in front of your eyes and basically act as your window into the virtual world.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/best-vr-accessories-150021126.html?src=rss",
    "full_text": "Let’s get something out of the way first: any pair of wired headphones will work with any VR headset. The SteelSeries Arctis Nova 4 headphones aren’t specifically designed for VR headsets, but they have plenty of features for enthusiasts. They have 360-degree spatial audio, a real game-changer for VR experiences, an AI-assisted microphone that reduces ambient noise and a fully customizable EQ, which comes in handy when streaming video or listening to music on a VR headset. These are also wireless headphones with Bluetooth that connect to just about everything. But you may still want to plug in directly when shuffling around a VR space to reduce lag. When going wireless, however, you’ll get 36 hours of use per charge and a quick-charge feature that juices up the headphones in just 15 minutes."

TikTok said that it surveyed over 870 songwriters and interviewed several to understand their needs in relation to profile building and creating monetization opportunities. The company also pointed to an independent survey, which indicated that more than half of songwriters who use social media to promote their profile use TikTok to do it. “TikTok is unique in its ability to offer songwriters a way to highlight their musical works alongside their own content, helping them to tell stories about their music, their craft, and their lives, and to raise their profile and build their audience on TikTok, as hundreds of thousands of artist creators already do,” TikTok’s Global Head of Music Publishing Licensing and Partnership said in a statement. TikTok joins streaming services like Spotify, which has let songwriters highlight their work for years now. Last year, Tidal went launched a tool to let musicians track royalties and manage their work for which they have songwriting credits. While TikTok decided to shut down its music streaming service, TikTok Music, last year, the platform still remains important for users to discover new music and for artists to promote their tracks. Earlier this year, the company released a TikTok for Artists tool that lets artists monitor the performance of their campaign and tracks."

Once that is done, I’m sure Clay can be a very powerful product.” Beeper today has millions of registered users, including those from Texts.com. A small portion of those who are still using Texts.com are now being offered the option to migrate to Beeper, since it has added the on-device technology, which they prefer. Bagaria said there may still be some remaining issues around reliability when moving to the on-device model, but those are being worked out as edge cases pop up. At some later point, Beeper Cloud will be deprecated once the company is sure the on-device model is capable of being everyone’s daily driver.

    "summary": "On Tuesday, Nintendo published an interview with the creators of Donkey Kong Bananza. The second big Switch 2 tentpole title comes from the team that made Super Mario Odyssey. The developers explained how they laid the foundation for DK's first 3D adventure since the Nintendo 64 era.\nDestruction is at the heart of Donkey Kong Bananza. Everything in his environment can be smashed to bits. Not only is that a fun mechanic, but it also adds an element of verticality and freedom of exploration. That's an ideal fit for showcasing the Switch 2's processing power.\nNintendo\nAs with so many other Nintendo creations, the first step in getting there was a no-brainer. Consult with Shigeru Miyamoto.\n\"We'd built up a lot of expertise in gameplay development for 3D action games through our work on 3D Mario games, including Super Mario Odyssey,\" producer Kenta Motokura said. \"But we needed to dive deeper into the fundamental question of 'What is Donkey Kong?' So, our first step was to seek out Miyamoto-san and Nintendo Executive Officer Yoshiaki Koizumi.\"\nIn their talk, Miyamoto emphasized DK's moves like hand slaps and blowing. Along similar lines, Koizumi pointed to the ape's massive arms, which he uses to punch and hoist heavy objects. That got the team thinking. After all, who doesn't want to control a giant ape who runs around, breaking shit?\nDK slapping a platform in the 2010 game Donkey Kong Country Returns. Shigeru Miyamoto emphasized the move as a starting point for the new version.Nintendo / Retro\nThe Super Mario Odyssey team was uniquely suited to handle that challenge. First, the 2017 title included some light environmental destruction. (Think the cheese rocks in the Luncheon Kingdom and Bowser's smashing in the final level.)\nThe team experimented with fully destructible environments soon after Odyssey's release. (That was long before they knew they'd make a Donkey Kong game.) That included the adorably strange idea of putting smashing fists on a Goomba and setting it loose. Part two of the interview includes a short video of one of these tests.\nOn a technical level, the key to that mechanic is using voxels (3D pixels). \"In Super Mario Odyssey, we started using voxels midway through development, so the areas where we could apply them were limited,\" Motukura said. \"But the trial and error we went through back then directly led to what we were able to do in Donkey Kong Bananza.\"\nAnother interesting tidbit from the interview is that they started working on the game as a Switch 1 title. \"We originally began developing Donkey Kong Bananza on Nintendo Switch, but we ran into some challenges,\" Motokura said. \"I think it was around 2021 when we started to think about moving development to Switch 2.\" In the comparison image below, you can see a much richer environment in the Switch 2 version.\nNintendo\nArt director Daisuke Watanabe explained that the new console's hardware opened new doors. \"We first looked into how we could upgrade what we'd originally built for Switch to take advantage of Switch 2,\" Watanabe said. \"One of the most obvious improvements was that we could place far more objects in the environment than before. Being able to place more objects in the terrain didn't just enhance the game's visual richness. More importantly, it increased the amount of things players could destroy, which amplified the exhilaration of being able to demolish anything and everything.\"\nThere are many more nuggets in Nintendo's interview. This includes animal transformations and Pauline's role in the game. (She must be the forgiving type, given how they started.) The chat also explores how DK's modern art style evolved.\nYou can visit Nintendo's website for the full lowdown. Donkey Kong Bananza will be available tomorrow, July 17.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/donkey-kong-bananzas-creators-reflect-on-the-games-path-to-delightful-destruction-201600462.html?src=rss",

So, our first step was to seek out Miyamoto-san and Nintendo Executive Officer Yoshiaki Koizumi.\" In their talk, Miyamoto emphasized DK's moves like hand slaps and blowing. DK slapping a platform in the 2010 game Donkey Kong Country Returns. That included the adorably strange idea of putting smashing fists on a Goomba and setting it loose. On a technical level, the key to that mechanic is using voxels (3D pixels). (She must be the forgiving type, given how they started.)"

The cuts come just a month after Meta hired Scale AI’s CEO in a $14.3 billion deal. In a memo obtained by Bloomberg, interim CEO Jason Droege told staff that Scale AI had too quickly scaled its core data-labeling business — in which the startup supplied AI labs with labeled, structured data to train AI models. Droege said in the memo that Scale AI would staff up around its enterprise and government sales units. Like other AI startups that have been reverse acqui-hired, such as Inflection, it seems that Scale AI now has to pivot from the business that put it on the map. In light of Meta’s investment, several of Scale AI’s largest data customers cut ties with the startup."

In a forum post from 2021, someone who appears to be a staffer at ArtificialAiming reflected about their then-14 years working at the cheat provider and proclaimed that “cheaters won,” as video game companies had to resort to spending millions of dollars to battle cheaters.

    "summary": "Steam has added a new rule to its guidelines that has resulted in certain games getting banned, according to a report by Automaton. The new clause states that \"content that may violate the rules and standards set forth by Steam's payment processors and related card networks and banks, or internet network providers\" is not allowed and could result in removal from the platform.\nIn other words, if credit card companies get mad about something, they could actually have the power to ban a game. The clause goes on to say that this will affect \"certain kinds of adult-only content.\"\nThis has likely already resulted in many games being pulled off the platform. The vast majority of these titles have obvious sexual themes and many have the word \"incest\" in the title. SteamDB doesn't give a reason for these removals, but the timing does match up.\nSteam has added a new rule disallowing games that violate the rules and standards set forth by payment processors and card networks, or internet network providers.At the same time, many incest themed games were removed from the store. pic.twitter.com/JHun6IZWyn— SteamDB (@SteamDB) July 16, 2025\n\nThis move might sound unusual on its face, but payment processors have consistently fought against being used to purchase adult content.

Mastercard went a step further in 2021, adding language to its \"Speciality Merchant Registration\" requirements that announced \"banks that connect merchants to our network will need to certify that the seller of adult content has effective controls in place to monitor, block and, where necessary, take down all illegal content.\"\nI doubt you'll find too many people upset that games with titles like Sex Adventures - Incest Family were removed from the platform, but it could set a potentially troubling precedent. Some Steam users are upset with this rule change on the grounds that it creates the \"quiet normalization of financial censorship.\"\nIn other words, if gigantic financial institutions get to decide what is appropriate and what is not, who is to say it won't eventually impact regular games? One Steam user notes that \"queer content gets flagged as 'explicit' even when it's PG,\" which is a sentiment echoed by others. One user says this move \"looks innocuous at first glance but it's a trojan horse.\"\nOn the flipside, Steam has been home to some truly foul content over the years.

But it sounds like we’re going to have to wait a while to see that side of the story unfold.\nSpeaking to Variety off the back of The Last of Us netting HBO 16 Emmy nominations this week, the company’s CEO, Casey Bloys, said season three is \"definitely planned for 2027.\" Bloys didn’t offer any more specific information about the release window, but the next batch of episodes arriving in the first half of 2027 would be consistent with the roughly two-year gap between seasons one and two.\nThe HBO Max chief also told Variety that a decision has yet to be made on whether the remaining chunk of narrative from The Last of Us Part II will be adapted into more than one additional season. Bloys said that the decision is being left to showrunner Craig Mazin. Mazin’s decision likely won’t involve input from Neil Druckmann, though. The Naughty Dog studio head and co-creator of the eponymous video game series stepped away from his role on the show after season two. But Bloys unsurprisingly doesn’t think (publicly at least) that Druckmann’s departure will affect the development of season three.\n\"It was fantastic to have Neil involved. A lot of people don’t realize that Neil has a full time job creating video games and running Naughty Dog. It’s a really big job that he’s got. So I understand why he needs to focus on that,\" he told Variety. \"But I believe he’s given us a good blueprint with the show. And obviously Craig is a pro, so I think we’ll be in excellent shape. I’m not worried at all.\"\nIf you are looking for a way to bridge the gap between now and what could be the final season of The Last of Us, a replay of the game it’s based on might be the way to go. Last week, Naughty Dog introduced a new Chronological Mode to the remastered version of the sequel that ditches the game’s frequent flashback sequences to focus on Ellie and Abby’s respective Seattle plotlines as they unfold.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/hbo-confirms-the-last-of-us-season-3-will-arrive-in-2027-161150871.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Mac owners will soon be able to play one of the biggest games of the last five years or so. Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition will be available in the Mac App Store as well as Steam, GOG.com and the Epic Games Store on Thursday, July 17. As the name implies, it includes both the base game as well as the Phantom Liberty expansion from 2023. The port was announced last fall and was originally planned to arrive \"early\" this year, but it took a little longer to get everything squared away.\nUnsurprisingly, you'll need an M-series Mac to play this game, but Apple and CD Projekt Red confirm that it'll work on computers all the way back to the M1 — but you'll need 16GB of RAM. For years, 8GB was the standard on entry-level Macs, so those computers will be out of luck. And of course, graphics fidelity will vary widely across the various supported chipsets, but CD Projekt Red is including a \"for this Mac\" graphics preset that is optimized for each Apple Silicon-based Mac. So at the very least, you shouldn't have to fuss around with settings too much to get a decent experience.\nShortly after the initial announcement, CD Projekt Red provided more details on the \"for this Mac\" setting as well as recommended specs. While the game does work with an M1 Mac, you're capped at 30fps and a low resolution — things escalate rapidly from there. The recommended configuration calls for an M3 Pro chip with 18GB of RAM to hit 60fps at 1080p. That configuration supports Ray Tracing, but regardless of what you're using you'll need to turn it on manually. \nCD Projekt Red\nThings go up from there, with 36GB of RAM and either an M2 Ultra or M3 Max chip to run high fidelity; very high fidelity requires an M3 Ultra or M4 Max. That essentially means you have a $2,000 or up Mac Studio or a $3,200 and up MacBook Pro with the M4 Max if you want to run this game at the highest of settings. Of course, if you care about such things, you probably already have a good gaming PC. \nAs for other technical goodies, the game utilizes AMD FSR for upscaling and frame generation, and Apple's MetalFX also provides upscaling as well. Upcoming Metal 4 features announced at WWDC 2025, including Metal FX Frame Interpolation and Metal FX Denoising, are coming to the game via a future update. Metal FX Frame Interpolation generates an intermediate frame for every two input frames and can be combined with existing Metal upscaling to allow the game to hit 120fps on Ultra settings — but again, we're not sure what specific models will support that.\nIf you use AirPods with your Mac, Cyberpunk 2077 features spatial audio with head-tracking features. And the game supports cross-progression regardless of what platform you play on, which should be useful for anyone who started a game elsewhere and wants to pick it back up on a Mac. If you've already purchased Cyberpunk 2077 from another storefront like Steam, it'll automatically be available for Mac.\nWhile Cyberpunk 2077 isn't exactly a new game, it remains one of the more popular and lauded titles of the decade (at least after CD Projekt Red fixed numerous launch bugs). And it joins a still small but growing number of major games optimized for Apple Silicon and the Mac, including the recently-released Assassin's Creed Shadows. A quick look on the Mac App Store also shows AAA releases including Death Stranding, Control, Lies of P, numerous Resident Evil titles as well as smaller but no less awesome games like Neva and Stray. Most big-name games don't come to the Mac at the same time as other platforms still, but the Mac is an option for more than just Apple Arcade games.\nUpdate, July 16, 2025, 11:44AM ET: This story has been updated with more details from the developer on the different specs required to hit the varying performance tiers in Cyberpunk 2077.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition-comes-to-the-mac-on-july-17-130047453.html?src=rss",

The announcement confirms some of TechCrunch’s reporting in May. Sofman previously led Waymo’s now shuttered self-driving trucks program. But he’s perhaps best known for his role as co-founder and CEO of Anki Robotics, which made the popular Cozmo consumer robot, and shut down in 2019. The company could not be reached for comment. TechCrunch will update this article with new details once Bedrock responds. Bedrock is the latest company to steer engineers who are adept at robotics, autonomy, and AI toward the off-road environment. Earlier this week, Pronto, a San Francisco-based startup that has developed a self-driving system designed for haulage trucks and other off-road vehicles used at construction and mining sites, acquired competitor SafeAI."

    "summary": "Prime Day might be behind us, but the dregs of the deals are still lingering. And if you’re in the market for a new pair of AirPods, you’re in luck. Apple’s ever-popular AirPods 4 (the ones without ANC) are currently down to $90 when purchased from Amazon, which is 30 percent off their usual price of $129. If you want the ANC model for those noisy flights, they’re 33 percent off at $120.\nWhile neither deal is quite as good as the ones we saw during the Prime day sale, you’re only going to be an extra dollar down regardless of which model you go for. The non-ANC AirPods 4 were $89 for Prime Day (a record low), while the noise-cancelling buds could be snagged for $119. If you missed out then, these deals are virtually the same. \n\n\nYou really can’t go wrong with the AirPods 4. While the AirPods Pro 2 remain our number one pick for the entire product category, we think the former are the best choice if you’re on a budget. Apple’s “regular” earbuds were given a long overdue spruce-up in 2024, offering the option of ANC on the non-Pro AirPods for the first time, as well as an improved design and better sound quality.\nWhether you go for the ANC or entry level model, you’ll benefit from the various features afforded by the H2 audio chip. These include Voice Isolation, Personalized Spatial Audio with dynamic head tracking, Personalized Volume and Adaptive EQ. The AirPods 4 with ANC add Conversation Awareness, Adaptive Audio and a Transparency mode to the spec sheet.\nDownsides? You still can’t change the volume using onboard controls, and the cheaper AirPods 4 don’t come with a case that supports wireless charging via MagSage or Qi, which is a disappointment. The AirPods Pro 4 with ANC do a pretty good job of banishing low-frequency background noise, but the noise-canceling capabilities aren't quite as strong as what you get with the AirPods Pro 2.\nCheck out our coverage of the best Apple deals for more discounts, and follow @EngadgetDeals on X for the latest tech deals and buying advice.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-airpods-4-are-still-on-sale-at-a-near-record-low-price-141631755.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Whether you’re shopping for a budget-friendly laptop for school or a sleek machine for everyday productivity, the best Chromebooks can offer surprising functionality for the price. Chromebooks have come a long way from their early days as web-only devices. Now, many Chromebook models feature powerful processors, premium displays and even touchscreen support, making them a compelling alternative to a regular laptop for plenty of users.There are more options than ever too, from lightweight clamshells to high-end, 2-in-1 designs that can easily replace your daily driver. Whether you're after a new Chromebook for streaming, work or staying on top of emails, there’s likely a model that fits both your budget and your workflow. We’ve tested the top Chromebooks on the market to help you find the right one — whether you’re after maximum value or top-tier performance.Editor’s note (7/16/25): While I still recommend everything in this guide, there’s one very intriguing new Chromebook I’m in the process of testing. Lenovo, who makes our pick for best overall Chromebook, just released a new premium model. The Chromebook Plus 14 starts at $649 and is the one of the first to use the ARM-based MediaTek Kompanio Ultra 910 chip. Most other performance-focused Chromebooks run on Intel or AMD chips, but so far the Kompanio Ultra has been more than up to what I’ve thrown at it. And the other benefit is battery life — Lenovo promises up to 17 hours. I haven’t fully tested this yet, but from what I’ve seen the ARM chip is unsurprisingly much more efficient than the Intel ones I use on most other Chromebooks. I’m hopeful that this laptop will last for 10 hours of real use, not just playing back video or some other low-power task.Design-wise, it has more in common with Google’s old Pixelbook Go or even a MacBook Air than most other Chromebooks. It's pleasantly thin (.63 inches) and light (2.58 pounds). It also features a 14-inch OLED display, 256GB of storage and 16GB of RAM. The model I’m testing costs $749, but there’s also a $649 configuration with 12GB of RAM, 128GB of storage and no touchscreen — but it uses the same chip, still has an OLED screen and should get similarly long battery life. The relatively high price makes me hesitate on calling this the best Chromebook for everyone, but it’ll almost certainly be the Chromebook to buy if you care about battery life. I’ll update this guide again once I finish my testing.\nTable of contents\n\nBest Chromebooks in 2025\nLenovo IdeaPad Flex 5i Chromebook Plus\nAcer Chromebook Plus 514\nAcer Chromebook Plus Spin 714\nAcer Chromebook Plus 516 GE\nBest Chromebooks FAQs\nOther Chromebooks we tested\n\nBest Chromebooks in 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBest Chromebooks FAQs\nWhat is Chrome OS, and why would I use it over Windows?\nThis is probably the number one question about Chromebooks. There are plenty of inexpensive Windows laptops on the market, so why bother with Chrome's operating system? Glad you asked. For me, the simple and clean nature of Chrome OS is a big selling point. Chrome OS is based on Google’s Chrome browser, which means most of the programs you can run are web based. There’s no bloatware or unwanted apps to uninstall like you often get on Windows laptops, it boots up in seconds, and you can completely reset to factory settings almost as quickly. \nOf course, simplicity will also be a major drawback for some users. Not being able to install native software can be a dealbreaker if you’re a video editor or software developer. But there are also plenty of people who do the majority of their work in a web browser, using tools like Google Docs and spreadsheets for productivity without needing a full Windows setup.\nGoogle and its software partners are getting better every year at supporting more advanced features. For example, Google added video editing tools to the Google Photos app on Chromebooks – it won’t replace Adobe Premiere, but it should be handy for a lot of people. Similarly, Google and Adobe announced Photoshop on the web in 2023, something that brings much of the power of Adobe’s desktop apps to Chromebooks.\nChromebooks can also run Android apps, which greatly expands the amount of software available. The quality varies widely, but it means you can do more with a Chromebook beyond just web-based apps. For example, you can install the Netflix app and save videos for offline watching. Other Android apps like Microsoft Office and Adobe Lightroom are surprisingly capable as well. Between Android apps and a general improvement in web apps, Chromebooks are more than just portals to a browser.\nWhat do Chromebooks do well?\n\n\n\n\nPut simply, web browsing and really anything web based. Online shopping, streaming music and video and using various social media sites are among the most common daily tasks people do on Chromebooks. As you might expect, they also work well with Google services like Photos, Docs, Gmail, Drive, Keep and so on. Yes, any computer that can run Chrome can do that too, but the lightweight nature of Google Chrome OS makes it a responsive and stable platform.\nAs I mentioned before, Chrome OS can run Android apps, so if you’re an Android user you’ll find some nice ties between the platforms. You can get most of the same apps that are on your phone on a Chromebook and keep info in sync between them. You can also use some Android phones as a security key for your Chromebook or instantly tether your 2-in-1 laptop to use mobile data.\nGoogle continues to tout security as a major differentiator for Chromebooks, and it’s definitely a factor worth considering. Auto-updates are the first lines of defense: Chrome OS updates download quickly in the background and a fast reboot is all it takes to install the latest version. Google says that each webpage and app on a Chromebook runs in its own sandbox as well, so any security threats are contained to that individual app. Finally, Chrome OS has a self-check called Verified Boot that runs every time a device starts up. Beyond all this, the simple fact that you generally can’t install traditional apps on a Chromebook means there are fewer ways for bad actors to access the system.\nIf you’re interested in Google’s Gemini AI tools, a Chromebook is a good option as well. Every Chromebook in our top picks comes with a full year of Google’s AI Pro plan — this combines the usual Google One perks like 2TB of storage and 10 percent back in purchases from the Google Store with a bunch of AI tools. You’ll get access to Gemini in Chrome, Gmail, Google Docs and other apps, Gemini 2.5 Pro in the Gemini app and more. Given that this plan is $20/month, it’s a pretty solid perk. Chromebook Plus models also include tools like the AI-powered “help me write,” the Google Photos Magic Editor and generative AI backgrounds you can create by filling in a few prompts.\nAs for when to avoid Chromebooks, the answer is simple: If you rely heavily on a specific native application for Windows or a Mac, chances are you won’t find the exact same option on a ChromeOS device. That’s most true in fields like photo and video editing, but it can also be the case in law or finance. Plenty of businesses run on Google’s G suite software, but more still have specific requirements that a Chromebook might not match. If you’re an iPhone user, you’ll also miss out on the way the iPhone easily integrates with an iPad or Mac. For me, the big downside is not being able to access iMessage on a Chromebook.\nFinally, gaming Chromebooks are not ubiquitous, although they’re becoming a slightly more reasonable option with the rise of cloud gaming. In late 2022, Google and some hardware partners announced a push to make Chromebooks with cloud gaming in mind. From a hardware perspective, that means laptops with bigger screens that have higher refresh rates as well as optimizing those laptops to work with services like NVIDIA GeForce Now, Xbox Game Pass and Amazon Luna. You’ll obviously need an internet connection to use these services, but the good news is that playing modern games on a Chromebook isn’t impossible. You can also install Android games from the Google Play Store, but that’s not what most people are thinking of when they want to game on a laptop.\nWhat are the most important specs for a Chromebook?\n\n\n\n\nChrome OS is lightweight and runs well on fairly modest hardware, so the most important thing to look for might not be processor power or storage space. But Google made it easier to get consistent specs and performance late last year when it introduced the Chromebook Plus initiative. Any device with a Chromebook Plus designation meets some minimum requirements, which happen to be very similar to what I’d recommend most people get if they’re looking for the best laptop they can use every day.\nChromebook Plus models have at least a 12th-gen Intel Core i3 processor, or an AMD Ryzen 3 7000 series processor, both of which should be more than enough for most people. These laptops also have a minimum of 8GB of RAM and 128GB of SSD storage, which should do the trick unless you’re really pushing your Chromebook. All Chromebook Plus models have to have a 1080p webcam, which is nice in these days of constant video calling, and they also all have to have at least a 1080p FHD IPS screen.\nOf course, you can get higher specs or better screens if you desire, but I’ve found that basically everything included in the Chromebook Plus target specs makes for a very good experience.\nGoogle has an Auto Update policy for Chromebooks as well, and while that’s not exactly a spec, it’s worth checking before you buy. Last year, Google announced that Chromebooks would get software updates and support for an impressive 10 years after their release date. This support page lists the Auto Update expiration date for virtually every Chromebook ever, but a good rule of thumb is to buy the newest machine you can to maximize your support.\nHow much should I spend on a Chromebook?\nChromebooks started out notoriously cheap, with list prices often coming in under $300. But as they’ve gone more mainstream, they’ve transitioned from being essentially modern netbooks to some of the best laptops you’ll want to use all day. As such, prices have increased: At this point, you should expect to spend at least $400 if you want a solid daily driver. There are still many Chromebooks out there available at a low price that may be suitable as secondary devices, but a good Chromebook that can be an all-day, every-day laptop will cost more. But, notably, even the best Chromebooks usually cost less than the best Windows laptops, or even the best “regular” laptops out there.\nThere are a handful of premium Chromebooks that approach or even exceed $1,000 that claim to offer better performance and more processing power, but I don’t recommend spending that much. Generally, that’ll get you a better design with more premium materials, as well as more powerful internals and extra storage space, like a higher-capacity SSD. Of course, you also sometimes pay for the brand name. But, the specs I outlined earlier are usually enough, and there are multiple good premium Chromebooks in the $700 to $800 range at this point.\nSee Also:\n\nBest Laptops for 2025\nBest Gaming Laptops\nBest 2-in-1 Laptops for 2025\nBest Cheap Windows Laptops\nBest Laptops for College Students \n\nOther Chromebooks we tested\nSamsung Galaxy Chromebook Plus\nSamsung’s Galaxy Chromebook Plus, released in late 2024, is one of the more unique Chromebooks out there. It’s extremely thin and light, at 0.46 inches and 2.6 pounds, but it manages to include a 15.6-inch display in that frame. That screen is a 1080p panel that’s sharp and bright, but its 16:9 aspect ratio made things feel a bit cramped when scrolling vertically. Performance is very good, and the keyboard is solid, though I’m not a fan of the number pad as it shifts everything to the left. At $700 it’s not cheap, but that feels fair considering its size and capabilities. If you’re looking for a big screen laptop that is also super light, this Chromebook merits consideration, even if it’s not the best option for everyone.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/best-chromebooks-160054646.html?src=rss",

Design-wise, it has more in common with Google’s old Pixelbook Go or even a MacBook Air than most other Chromebooks. This means you get more vertical screen real estate, which is something I appreciate over a standard 1080p display. At 3.5 pounds and 0.78 inches thick, it’s definitely not the lightest or slimmest option out there. The latest Spin 714 costs $700 – not an unreasonable price for a computer with these specs and built quality.

    "summary": "Apple's Irish tax break problems are officially over. Ireland's Department of Finance has reported that the entirety of the €14.25 billion fund in Apple's escrow account for the case has been fully transferred to the Exchequer or Ireland's central fund. The escrow account has, therefore, been closed. This marks the end of one of the world's largest antitrust cases that started way back in 2013 when the European Commission launched an investigation to determine whether Apple was enjoying better tax rates than warranted under the bloc's laws. \nThe commission found that the tax breaks Ireland gave Apple back then was illegal shortly after its investigation started. Then in 2016, after years of investigation, the commission ruled that the company had to pay back the \"illegal state aid\" it received over a 10-year-period before the probe into its tax practices was launched, since it was given \"significant advantage\" over its rivals. \nApparently, Apple created Irish subsidiaries that owned most of its intellectual properties. Every time the company sells a product, the Irish subsidiaries get paid for the use of Apple's IPs. And thanks to the company's agreement with Ireland, Apple was only paying a 1 percent tax rate on European profits that became as low as .005 percent in 2014. The Commission ordered Apple to pay back the €13.1 billion in taxes it owed from between 2003 and 2014, with an interest of €1.2 billion on top. \nIn 2018, the company transferred €14.3 billion to an escrow account as it appealed the Commission's ruling. The EU's General Court ruled in Apple's favor in 2020, explaining that there wasn't enough evidence to show that the company had broken the bloc's rules. But in 2024, the European Court of Justice overturned that decision and confirmed the Commission's original ruling in 2016. \nAs The Irish Times has reported, the funds continued depreciating in value since it was deposited into escrow until 2023. It only managed to regain €470 million within 16 months before the account's closure in May, thanks to higher interest rates and investments with higher yields. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/apples-%E2%82%AC143-billion-irish-tax-break-case-is-officially-over-113755771.html?src=rss",

Plus, new content is released every week and as a worldwide service, Netflix is consistently adding movies and TV shows from around the globe that can change the viewing experience in ways you may not have considered (Are you sure you’re not into K-Dramas, Finnish detective thrillers or British home improvement shows? That doesn’t mean it’s always simple to choose something to watch, but when it comes to swapping profiles or simply picking up where you left off, it doesn’t get better than this. If you’re heading off the grid — or onto a plane — then you can easily download most (but not all) of its content to watch on your iOS or Android device. The other thing to keep in mind is that maybe if you’ve let your account lapse, the service that exists now is very different from what you would’ve seen two years ago, or five, or ten. Remaining the dominant player in subscription streaming has required adjustments to stay on top with a changing mix of content and plans to choose from. In the US, there are three levels of Netflix you can subscribe to. All of them include unlimited access to the same content, work on the same devices and you can cancel or pause them at any time. The difference between Standard ($15.50 per month) and Premium ($23 per month) comes down to picture quality and the amount of simultaneous streams allowed."

    "summary": "The best soundbars can completely transform your TV setup, turning flat, lifeless audio into something that actually sounds cinematic. Whether you're watching blockbuster movies, listening to music or gaming, a good soundbar delivers clearer vocals, deep bass and better overall playback than most built-in TV speakers ever could.In 2025, there’s a soundbar for every kind of home entertainment setup — from compact all-in-one units to full surround systems with subwoofers and rear speakers. Some prioritize simplicity and sleek design, while others are packed with immersive features like Dolby Atmos and smart voice controls. No matter your budget or your space, we’ve picked the best soundbars you can buy right now to help elevate your audio experience.\nTable of contents\n\nThe post-CES soundbar outlook for 2025\nBest soundbars for 2025\nWhat to look for in a soundbar \nOther soundbars we tested\nBest soundbar FAQs\n\nThe post-CES soundbar outlook for 2025\nI typically come out of CES with a pretty clear understanding of the new soundbars that are coming for the year, but that wasn’t exactly the case in 2025. LG decided to carry over its most premium soundbars from 2024, but it will add the compact S20A this year. The company only previewed the model at CES, so full specs are still forthcoming. \nSamsung will once again keep the same overall design and features for its top-end Q990 soundbar. However, the company is adding a few new tools and it drastically reduced the size of the wireless subwoofer that comes in the box. Samsung does have one new model for 2025, the QS700F, that’s designed to sit on a table or automatically adjust to being mounted flat on a wall. Details are scarce on that soundbar for now and I anticipate a full spec sheet when the company is really to sell it.\nOf the big three TV companies, Sony is the only one that didn’t announce any home theater gear at CES. The company has decided to focus mainly on its automotive efforts at the show recently, leaving TV and audio announcements for later in the year. The company debuted multiple soundbar options in 2024 and a four-speaker setup for the living room in the Bravia Quad. That said, it wouldn’t surprise me if Sony released new soundbars later in the year since its most recent models were only announced last April.\nOne company I would keep an eye on is Sennheiser. The original Ambeo model is nearly six years old and could use a refresh. The company has added medium and mini options to the Ambeo lineup since then, but it would be nice to see a refined version of the largest model too. The original Ambeo soundbar is huge, so no matter how good it sounds, it will always be a tough sell for some people.\nAlthough I think it’s less likely, it’s also possible that Sonos has new soundbars this year. While the company’s next device will likely be the rumored set-top streaming box, the Sound Motion tech inside the Arc Ultra would offer a big improvement to bass performance in compact models like the Beam and Ray. The company may bring Sound Motion to standalone speakers first, but it’s destined for those smaller soundbars eventually.\nThe best soundbars for 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat to look for in a soundbar\nFeatures\nWhen it comes to features, the more you pay the more you're going to get in your new audio system. Most affordable options ($150 or less) will improve your television's audio quality, but that's about it. Step into the $300 to $400 range and you'll find all-in-one soundbars with things like built-in voice control, wireless connectivity, Google Chromecast, AirPlay 2 and even Android TV. They're all helpful when you want to avoid looking for the remote control, but the best playback quality is usually only in the top tier and the formats those premium soundbar systems support. I’m talking about things like Dolby Atmos, DTS:X and other high-resolution audio standards — essentials if you’re building a truly cinematic home entertainment setup. And not all Atmos soundbars are equal, so you'll need to look at the finer details carefully before you break into the savings account. If you're looking for one of the best Dolby Atmos soundbars, size, channels and subwoofer options will be important factors to consider. Some models even include a dedicated subwoofer to enhance bass performance, bringing an extra punch to action scenes and soundtracks.\nPorts\n\n\n\n\nThis is a big one. A lot of the more affordable soundbars are limited when it comes to connectivity options. They either offer an optical port or one HDMI jack and, if you're lucky, both. Things get slightly better in the mid-range section, but that's not always the case. The Sonos Beam, for example, is $449, but only has a single HDMI port. Even at the higher-end, the $899 Sonos Arc still only has one HDMI port. If you plan to connect multiple devices like a set-top box, gaming laptop or console directly to your soundbar for the best audio experience, you’ll want an option with at least two HDMI (eARC) inputs. HDMI connections are critical for supporting Dolby Atmos and Dolby Digital audio formats, as well as high-res passthrough for HDR and 8K/4K content.\nChannels\nAnother big thing you’ll want to pay attention to when looking for the best soundbar is channels. That’s the 2.1, 7.1.2 or other decimal number that companies include in product descriptions. The first figure corresponds to the number of channels. A two would just be left and right while a more robust Atmos system, especially one with rear surround speakers, could be five or seven (left, right, center and upward). The second number refers to the dedicated subwoofer, so if your new soundbar comes with one or has them built in, you’ll see one here. The third numeral is up-firing speakers, important for the immersive effect of Dolby Atmos. Not all Atmos-enabled units have them, but if they do, the third number will tell you how many are in play and how they contribute to the overall soundstage.\nWireless\n\n\n\n\nMost soundbars these days offer either Bluetooth, Wi-Fi or both. When it comes to Wi-Fi, that connectivity affords you luxuries like voice control (either built-in or with a separate device), Chromecast, Spotify Connect and AirPlay 2. Depending on your preferences, you might be able to live without some of these. For me, AirPlay 2 and Chromecast are essentials, but the rest I can live without. Those two give me the ability to beam music and podcasts from my go-to apps without having to settle for — or struggle with — a Bluetooth connection. For instance, Sonos speakers often offer seamless integration with iOS devices, making it easy to connect and stream music wirelessly. If you’re looking for a wireless speaker that can enhance your TV setup while also offering flexibility for audio throughout the house, it's worth considering a multi-room system.\nSize\nThis one might seem obvious but humor me for a minute. Nothing is more soul-crushing than getting a pricey soundbar in your living room only to discover you have to rearrange everything to find a spot for it. This was my plight when the Sennheiser Ambeo Soundbar arrived at my door. Yes, that speaker is absurdly large (and heavy), and most soundbars aren't nearly as big. I learned a valuable lesson: Make sure the space where you want to put a soundbar will accommodate the thing you're about to spend hundreds (if not thousands) of dollars on.\nBasically, it all comes down to the TV you have (or are planning to get) and what the primary goal is for your living-room audio. Is it ease of use? Do you want the best possible sound from a single speaker or speaker/sub combo? Do you just want to be able to actually hear your TV better? Or do you want a full home entertainment experience with crisp vocals, thunderous deep bass, and immersive surround system audio?\nBy paying attention to each of those areas, you should have a good idea of what to look for in a soundbar, soundbar/subwoofer combo, Dolby Digital system or a more robust setup. With that said, we've put numerous products through their paces at Engadget and have a few favorites for best soundbar at various price points to get you started.\nOther soundbars we tested\nSonos Arc\nThere’s no doubt that the Arc is Sonos’ best-sounding soundbar, but it’s also the company’s most expensive. With a new model based on the Arc rumored to be on the way, it’s difficult to recommend this product over the likes of Samsung and Sony. The Arc works well as both a soundbar and a speaker, and the device will fit in nicely with other Sonos gear you might already have for a multiroom setup. It only has one HDMI port though, where much of the competition allows you to connect streaming and gaming devices directly to their soundbars.\nSennheiser Ambeo Soundbar Plus\nI don’t think Sennheiser’s medium-sized model offers enough to stand out from the more powerful Ambeo Soundbar Max or the Ambeo Soundbar Mini. The Mini is more affordable and does a solid job with immersive audio in its own right. Like the rest of the Ambeo lineup, there’s no option for satellite speakers as you can only add a subwoofer to the soundbars. However, the Ambeo Soundbar Plus does have RCA input, so you can use it with a turntable if you’re into vinyl.\nBest soundbar FAQs\nIs a soundbar better than speakers?\nIt really depends on what you’re after. A soundbar is definitely a simpler, more compact solution compared to a full speaker setup. If you want better sound than your TV’s built-in setup but don’t want to deal with multiple speakers and wires everywhere, a soundbar is probably the way to go. Some soundbars can even deliver impressive surround sound effects, thanks to features like Dolby Atmos and virtual audio technology. \nHowever, if you’re an audiophile or want true surround sound for an at-home theater experience, a multi-speaker setup with a receiver, surround speakers and subwoofer will give you a richer soundstage and more control over your experience.\nWhat connection do I need for a soundbar?\nMost modern soundbars connect to your TV via HDMI ARC or eARC, which is the easiest and best option for achieving high-quality audio. If your TV supports this, all you need is an HDMI cable, and you’ll get not only great sound but also some extra features like controlling the soundbar with your TV remote. \nIf HDMI ARC isn’t an option on your TV, you can use an optical cable, which also delivers solid audio quality. Some soundbars even offer Bluetooth or Wi-Fi connections for streaming music, and a few still have a 3.5mm aux jack for connecting to older devices. \nDo all soundbars come with subwoofers?\nNot all soundbars come with subwoofers, but many do or at least offer one as an optional add-on that you can purchase separately. A subwoofer is what gives you that deep, booming bass, so if you like action movies or want a fuller sound for music, having one can make a big difference. Some soundbars have a built-in subwoofer, but these generally don’t provide the same punch as a separate one. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/speakers/best-soundbars-143041791.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Welcome to Video Games Weekly on Engadget. Expect a new story every Monday or Tuesday, broken into two parts. The first is a space for short essays and ramblings about video game trends and related topics from me, Jess Conditt, a reporter who's covered the industry for more than 13 years. The second contains the video game stories from the past week that you need to know about, including some headlines from outside of Engadget.\nPlease enjoy — and I'll see you next week.\n\nIf I end up reading one more story about how fantastic Death Stranding 2 is so long as you skip the cutscenes, I’m gonna hurl. At what point during 10 hours of cinematic interstitials do we collectively put the controller down and say, actually, this isn’t a great game? Not because the game parts aren’t any good — they’re pretty fabulous, in fact — but because a significant portion of the experience isn’t actually interactive at all. When does it become more accurate to describe a Hideo Kojima project as a CGI movie with moments of interactivity, rather than as a video game first?\nI’m not actually attempting to solve the “video game of Theseus” riddle right now, but it’s a conversation that’s been on my mind, given recent headlines. Death Stranding 2 reviews are in, Neil Druckmann is out at HBO and returning to Naughty Dog full-time, and Emmy nominations arrived with 18 nods for video game adaptations. Meanwhile, layoffs are rocking the gaming industry yet again, with thousands fired at Xbox this month, alongside multiple studio closures and game cancellations. One of the most surprising titles to get the ax was Project Blackbird, a promising-sounding MMO from Elder Scrolls studio ZeniMax Online. Blackbird was reportedly canceled in favor of allocating resources to the development of Fallout 5, a series with mainstream clout following the success of Amazon’s Fallout TV show in 2024.\nThe convergence of video games and Hollywood is not a new talking point — even for me — but it’s only grown more relevant with time. Sony in particular is leaning hard into a cross-media strategy with notable investments in television, anime and film adaptations of its video game franchises, and it just published Kojima Productions’ Death Stranding 2, which serves as a lightning rod for this entire conversation.\nKojima is easy to pick on because he’s been so vocal about his desire to make movies, and fittingly, his games have only grown more cinematic over the years. Death Stranding and its sequel are stacked with mainstream Hollywood actors (and Kojima’s favorite directors) across hours of drawn-out, non-interactive cutscenes. His next two projects, OD and Physint, are both described as having A-list casts and “blurring the boundaries between film and games.”\nI’m a big fan of experimental horror games, and I deeply appreciate Kojima’s eye for building tension and sneaky action sequences, but I’m hesitant to get excited about OD and Physint. The deeper Kojima dives into the world of Hollywood, the more he loses me. I don’t download, install and boot up a video game to watch a movie instead, and I don’t find it impressive when an interactive product is defined by cinematic terms. The constraints of filmmaking are vastly different than those of video game development, and it sucks to watch a talented creator try to force video games to conform to the boundaries of movies or TV, rather than exploring the mechanics that make interactive art so uniquely powerful. I feel like Kojima sees cinema as the goal, not video games specifically, and this perspective breaks my little pixelated heart.\nIt’s particularly painful in an era of raging instability for the video game industry. It’s difficult to see so much money and creative talent being thrown at projects that end up feeling more like movies than games, at a time when it’s increasingly difficult for fresh and original AAA projects to make it to market. Video games have not been maxed out as an art form — there’s far more to discover in terms of mechanics, visuals, haptics and immersive interaction systems, and there are more stories that can only be told with these specific tools. Viewing game development through the lens of filmmaking diminishes everything that makes this medium so powerful. The only Hollywood trait the games industry should imitate is its powerful and functional unions.\nI enjoy things that exist in the gray space between definitions; in fact, I often prefer them. What I don’t enjoy is misguided emulation that’s sold to an audience as innovation. In the end, I guess what I’m really saying is… I’m still not over PT.\n\nThe news\nKing developers were the architects of their own demise\nOne of the most eyebrow-raising details of Microsoft’s sweeping layoffs earlier this month was the fact that King, the studio behind Candy Crush, was included in the firings. King is historically a money-printing machine with high per-employee returns, which tends to insulate it from layoffs, but this time around at least 200 people were let go from the studio. As it turns out, a number of fired developers spent the past few years training AI systems to do their jobs, which just adds a layer of shittiness to an already crappy situation.\nBest Buy will have more Switch 2 units on Thursday\nHas the FOMO gotten to you yet? After denying that you wanted a Switch 2 for a few noble and self-righteous weeks, have you cracked and admitted that you actually, really want one? Great — then get yourself to Best Buy on Thursday, July 17, when the company will restock its supply of Switch 2 consoles in all stores. This coincides with the release of Donkey Kong Banaza, too.\nA small update on Ken Levine’s Judas (sung like Lady Gaga)\nI’ve had my eye on Judas, the BioShocky FPS from Ken Levine’s Ghost Story Games, since it was revealed in 2022, and I lowkey love how little we still know about it today. That said, I’m happily devouring every bit of information about Judas, and the latest nugget comes from Levine himself in an interview with classic game publisher Nightdive Studios. With Judas, Ghost Story is focused on \"telling the story and transporting the player somewhere,\" rather than building live-service or microtransaction features, Levine said. As he put it, “You buy the game and you get the whole thing. There's no online component. There's no live service.”\nThere’s also no release date for Judas yet.\n\nSummer Games Done Quick can’t stop raising millions for charity\nThe crazy kids at Summer Games Done Quick have done it once again and raised literal millions of dollars for Doctors Without Borders in a single weekend, simply by playing video games in silly ways without stopping. SGDQ 2025 wrapped up on Sunday with a total donation pool of $2,436,614. The organization's next event is another edition of Flame Fatales, a speedrunning showcase featuring women and femmes that runs from September 7 to 14. We’ll see you there.\nOusted Subnautica 2 studio bosses are suing Krafton\nThe well of Subnautica 2 drama runs deep. Earlier in July the heads of Subnatica 2 studio Unknown Worlds Entertainment — Charlie Cleveland, Ted Gill and Max McGuire — were ousted by the team’s parent company, Krafton, and the game’s early access release was delayed to 2026. What’s more, Bloomberg reported that the studio had been in line for a $250 million bonus if it had met certain financial goals by the end of the year, but those largely hinged on an early access release. Cleveland said on social media that Subnautica 2 was ready for early access, and Krafton responded to the whole shebang by accusing the fired developers of abandoning their responsibilities as studio heads. Cleveland and others are now apparently filing a lawsuit against Krafton. GamesIndustry.biz has a comprehensive timeline of the Subnautica 2 controversy right here.\nAdditional reading\n\nKris Holt’s weekly indie game roundup\nGhost of Yōtei's lo-fi beats mode sums up the very best and very worst of this very weird series by Chris Tapsell at Eurogamer\n\n\nHave a tip for Jessica?

    "summary": "Discoveries keep pouring out of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Researchers observed an unusual cluster, which they dubbed the Infinity Galaxy. It appears to support a leading theory on how some supermassive black holes form.\nAlthough \"Infinity Galaxy\" sounds like a place Thanos would hang out, it merely describes its appearance. Two compact, red nuclei, each surrounded by a ring, give the cluster the shape of an infinity symbol.\nWhat's inside is more interesting. (After all, this is a much lower-res image than some of the eye candy the Webb telescope has yielded.) Researchers believe the Infinity Galaxy formed when two spiral galaxies (the nuclei in the image) collided. Between them lies a young supermassive black hole within an enormous cloud of gas.\nSupermassive black holes can range from hundreds of thousands of times the size of our sun to millions or billions of times its size. This one is about a million times as big.\nThe Infinity Galaxy, overlaid with a contour map indicating the supermassive black holeNASA / JWST\nThe Infinity Galaxy lends weight to the direct collapse theory of black hole formation. As you probably know, most black holes form when massive stars collapse. The presence of supermassive ones is harder to explain.\nOne theory proposes that smaller black holes merge over time to form a supermassive one. The problem there is that some supermassive black holes formed soon after the Big Bang. So, scientists think some supermassive ones form instead from the collapse of gas clouds, much like the one we see here. The Infinity Galaxy may be the best evidence yet for that direct collapse hypothesis.\nOne of the paper's lead authors summarized the findings. \"By looking at the data from the Infinity Galaxy, we think we've pieced together a story of how a direct collapse could have happened here,\" Pieter van Dokkum wrote in a press release. \"Two disk galaxies collide, forming the ring structures of stars that we see. During the collision, the gas within these two galaxies shocks and compresses. This compression might just be enough to form a dense knot, which then collapsed into a black hole.\"\nThe team can't definitively confirm the theory from their current data. \"But we can say that these new data strengthen the case that we're seeing a newborn black hole, while eliminating some of the competing explanations,\" van Dokkum added. \"We will continue to pore through the data and investigate these possibilities.\"This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/science/space/webb-spots-infinity-galaxy-that-sheds-light-on-black-hole-formation-183900161.html?src=rss",

A game based on a decades-old sci-fi franchise by a relatively unknown developer? It should have been a train wreck. Instead, it's a solid 3D action title that perfectly captures the vibe of the original film. This is a must-play for children of the 1980s. It'll be available on July 17 for subscribers on all tiers.\n\nGrounded 2 looks to be a fantastic take on the \"shrunken teens navigating a yard\" genre, as first pioneered in the film Honey, I Shrunk the Kids. The first game was great and Obsidian looks to be upping the ante here in nearly every way, with a larger focus on story, a more immersive world and insects to ride around on. This is a day one Game Pass release, which happens on July 29. It'll only be playable for PC and Ultimate subscribers.\n\nThe Annapurna-published Wheel World is finally heading our way on July 23, and it's a day one Game Pass release. This is an open-world bicycle sim with gorgeous cel-shaded graphics. The title promises \"impressive vistas, hidden secrets and races that will test your skills.\" It'll be available for Ultimate and PC subscribers.\n\nWuchang: Fallen Feathers is another day one release, with availability on July 24. This is a Souls-like action RPG set in the final days of the Ming Dynasty. The combat looks absolutely brutal. Again, only Ultimate and PC subscribers will have access to the game.\nThose are just the titles that caught my interest. The shooter High On Life returns to the platform today and the survival horror adventure My Friendly Neighborhood drops on July 17. The prison-based RPG Back to the Dawn will be playable on July 18 and the survival crafting title Abiotic Factor releases on July 22.

    "summary": "Sony just surprised the photography world by unveiling the RX1R III, a fixed-lens 35mm full-frame compact camera. Coming nearly ten years after the RX1R II, it has a 61MP Exmor R sensor along with Sony's latest image processing technology that promises low noise and high dynamic range. \nApart from all the new tech, the RX1R III is smaller and more streamlined than before and considerably lighter at 17 ounces than its main competition, Leica's Q3 and the Fujifilm GFX100RF. With that, it's designed to be a \"carrying around\" camera for street photographers, serious amateurs and others.  \nThat small size is due in part to the Zeiss Sonnar T 35mm f2 lens that sits partly inside the body. While more compact than before, it has the same optics as the last model and offers high levels of sharpness and color rendering, according to Sony. It comes with a macro ring that enables users to get as close as 20cm to subjects and feature's Sony's new \"Step Crop Shooting\" function that allows 35mm, 50mm and 70mm focal lengths by cropping into the sensor, just like the GFX100RF can do with a similar button. \n\n\n\n\n  Sony\n \n\nThe RX1R II has up to 15 stops of dynamic range thanks to the high-res sensor and image processing engine. It also features an anti-reflection coating and no optical low-pass filter to boost image quality, though that can cause some moire and other artifacts. Shooting speeds aren't quick at just 5 fps, though it's obviously not designed for sports.\nThe electronic viewfinder is middling with 2.36 million dots and 0.7x magnification, though the rear display offers a decent 2.4 million dots of resolution. However, unlike the one on the previous model that tilted out and up, it's fixed in order to save weight and size. It also lacks any in-body or optical stabilization, relying solely on electronic shake reduction. \nWith Sony's latest Bionz XR and AI processors, it promises accurate tracking of \"subjects, human bodies, heads and the position of eyes,\" Sony said, even if their faces aren't visible. It uses 693 phase-detection AF points covering around 78 percent of the image, just like Sony's A7R V. \n\n\nIt's not nearly as powerful as the A7R V for video, but can still handle 4K 30 fps video with 10-bit 4:2:2 color sampling, along with 1080p video at up to 120 fps. No log mode is available, but you do get the log-like S-Cinetone that boosts dynamic range a bit. Other features include a single SDXC UHS II slot, a mic input (but not headphone jack), a microHDMI port and a USB-C input. \nThe R1XR III is much more expensive than the RX1R II was at launch. It'll go on pre-order soon for $5,100, with shipping set to start on July 31st. Sony is also offering a handful of accessories (also expensive), including a $300 (!) thumb grip, $250 body case and $200 lens hood (!!). \n\n\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cameras/sonys-61mp-rx1r-iii-fixed-lens-compact-camera-is-finally-here-after-a-ten-year-wait-152707087.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Insta360 has launched a firmware upgrade and new accessories for its X5 360-degree camera as part of what it calls the Insta360 Summer Update. Key new features include \"AdaptiveTone\" to improve dual camera exposure, a new \"Ultra Battery\" for longer recording times, an ND filter set and custom-designed lenses. \n\"It can be a struggle for dual-lens cameras like X5 to balance the exposure across both lenses,\" the company explained. To fix this issue it came up with AdaptiveTone, which independently records light data for both lenses in order to preserve highlight and shadow detail across the entire spherical image. Then, in automatically adjusts the exposure based on the perspective you choose, supposedly resulting in more natural-looking footage. It works with both 360 video at 8K 30 fps and 5.7K 30fps along with flat PureVideo.  \nAnother key update is for PureVideo, allowing it work single lens mode rather than just in 360 mode as before. That will allow creators to capture low-light footage with reduced noise and improved color fidelity in both flat and spherical modes. \nBattery life was another key target. The X5 now supports Endurance Mode in 8K, allowing nearly two hours of continuous recording while improving endurance mode at 5.7K 24 fps with a boost from 185 to 208 minutes. Should you need even more performance in that regard, Insta360 is selling a new $50 Ultra Battery that boosts runtime by up to 17 percent to just under four hours max. \n\n\n\n\n  Mat Smith for Engadget\n \n\nAnother new accessory is X5 ND filters that give creators more options in bright lighting conditions. The kit includes ND16, ND32 and ND64 filters, letting you reduce shutter speeds to create natural motion blur for activities like mountain biking and motorcycle footage. Plus, Insta360 is offering an X5 custom replacement lens kit with pre-made patterns, AI artwork or your own images, to swap out with the standard lenses. \nMotorcycle creators are getting some extra love, too. Enhancements include immersive stabilization that preserves some natural shake to enhance the feeling of speed, along with Sena headset integration that allows start/stop recording and voice commands for hands-free operation. It also introduced a GPS preview remote with a built-in mic that combines camera control, live preview, GPS data recording and a noise canceling mic. Finally, the Plate Blur feature automatically obscures your license plate in footage, saving you the trouble of doing that manually. \nOther updates include new diving accessories and software updates with a new Invisible Dive Case Pro and buoyancy control accessory, along with an updated AquaVision 3.0 algorithm that analyzes underwater footage and provides a selection of color adjustments to best match the shot. You can also connect the X5 to a Suunto dive computer so you can bake your diving data right into the footage. \nFinally, Insta360 introduced updates to its Studio editing software like improved export speeds, background exports and improvements to the AI Stitching algorithm. And now, you can preview video files in their folder on your computer without the need to open them in Studio, saving time. The software updates, along with all the new accessories, are now available on Insta360's website. \n\n\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cameras/insta360s-x5-cam-update-brings-nd-filters-a-giant-battery-and-improved-exposure-150007247.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Google has closed a $3 billion deal to secure 3,000 megawatts of hydroelectric power, as it looks to meet the data demands of its growing AI and cloud computing platforms by harnessing low-cost clean energy. Brookfield Asset Management's renewables division says that its deal with Google is the largest deal of its kind for hydroelectricity. The first phase of this deal will provide Google with 670MW of carbon-free electricity from Brookfield’s Holtwood and Safe Harbor plants in Pennsylvania.\nThe Hydro Framework Agreement (HFA) allows Google to upgrade or develop the existing facilities as it sees fit in an ongoing commitment to adding more power to the grid. At the outset, Google’s efforts will largely be focused on the PJM, the largest grid in the US with 65 million customers, which is currently struggling to keep up with the data demands of big tech’s seemingly insatiably power-hungry AI projects. In time, the new partners will have the option of expanding into other regions in the country. Google said in a statement that it was dedicated to \"responsibly growing the digital infrastructure that powers daily life for people, communities and businesses.\"\nGoogle’s latest energy deal comes in the same week that AI rival Meta said it will spend hundreds of billions of dollars on a number of gigwatt-sized data centers, as part of its quest to create better-than-human-level \"superintelligence\" in all of its AI domains. The new campuses will be among the largest on earth, with the first to arrive being the Ohio-based Prometheus at some point next year.\nA typical data center consumes around 500,000 gallons of water each day, but the emerging AI-focused complexes being built by tech giants could reportedly push this figure into the millions, as recently reported by The New York Times. When the volume of water needed to power these facilities eclipses what is readily available, local communities often bear the brunt through rising prices and potential water shortages in the future.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/google-spends-%C2%A33-billion-on-securing-energy-for-its-data-centers-and-ai-expansion-145145966.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "The Department of Commerce has opened national security investigations into imports of drones and polysilicon, a raw material used in chips and solar panels. Among other things, officials are looking into \"predatory trade practices\" and the capacity of other countries to \"weaponize their control over supplies\" of drones, drone parts and polysilicon, as well as derivatives of each.\nThe DoC commenced the investigations on July 1, but has only just disclosed them publicly. The probes could lead to the US imposing yet more tariffs on imports, which would drive up prices of drones and products that use polysilicon. Per notices that are being published in the Federal Register, officials will consider \"whether additional measures, including tariffs or quotas, are necessary to protect national security.\"\nPresident Donald Trump has used the same legal process as these investigations to apply tariffs to imports of steel and aluminium (50 percent), cars and car parts (25 percent) and copper (50 percent as of August 1). There are other investigations underway into the likes of semiconductors, consumer electronics, aerospace components and pharmaceuticals. They're being conducted under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act.\nAccording to The Financial Times, China is the leading market for polysilicon manufacturing. Around three quarters of all commercial drones are said to be manufactured in the country too. Under the Biden administration, the US increased tariffs on solar wafers and polysilicon imports from China to 50 percent at the start of 2025. DJI also faces a potential ban in the US.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/us-probes-imports-on-drones-and-a-raw-material-used-in-chips-and-solar-panels-131546876.html?src=rss",
