In an update on Thursday, Parsons wrote that he has “decided to pass the torch” to longtime Bungie developer Justin Truman. Parsons has worked at Bungie for over 20 years and led the studio through the launch of Destiny 2 in 2017, along with the release of its major expansion pack, The Final Shape. “We’ve been through so much together: we launched a bold new chapter for Destiny, built an enviable, independent live ops organization capable of creating and publishing its own games, and joined the incredible family at Sony Interactive Entertainment,” Parsons writes. Truman joined Bungie in 2010 and became chief development officer in 2022. He says the team is “currently heads down” on both Marathon and Destiny, adding that “we’ll have more to show you in both of these worlds later this year.”"

Posts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed. The NFL and Microsoft have extended their arrangement that makes Surface tablets a familiar fixture on gameday sidelines, but naturally, now there’s an AI-powered twist on top. While Tom Brady is no longer actively putting those slates in danger of destruction, they do have something to offer to coaches and players. Microsoft touts a GitHub Copilot-based feature that filters plays to make strategy calls based on the situation, and a Microsoft 365 Copilot-based dashboard that sorts spreadsheets for analysts in the booth to filter through game data quickly. Along with their multiyear contract extension, Microsoft and the NFL announced that the Sideline Viewing System for every team is now connecting to more than 2,500 Surface Copilot Plus PCs (complete with massive “Copilot” logos on the case carrying strap). I figure we’ll be able to tell if AI is having an impact on the NFL when someone asks a coach about their prompts after a playoff game, as long as there aren’t any more network issues to blame. The two claim that “analyzing draft prospect performance outside the NFL Combine, providing data-driven business and football operations insights to clubs, and driving productivity across all business functions, including finance, human resources, and events” will be next up for AI applications."

    "full_text": "is a senior editor and founding member of The Verge who covers gadgets, games, and toys. Despite its partners Samsung and Motorola getting into flip-style phones where the screens opens up vertically like an old school Motorola Razr, Google says it intends to sit out that race. It’s also not currently working on a smart ring and has paused development on a tablet overhaul until it figures out a meaningful future for the category, executives said. Osterloh says it’s still “TBD” whether Google itself will release glasses again, but he’s intent on the category being part of the company’s future. To be fair, Google has almost always shown off those glasses prototypes alongside the XR headsets it’s co-developing with Samsung, and — like Meta — it seems more interested in making Android XR a platform for other glasses partners too. If Google were to release glasses again, though, Bloomberg did get one interesting hint about how they might work. Osterloh and his deputy Shakil Barkat suggested in the interview that display-free glasses might pair nicely with a smaller phone, one that could unfold for your entertainment needs as well. But, again, it sounds like Google wants to “sit out” Razr-style folding flip phones for now. Google would hesitate before announcing glasses, I bet, because of its infamous fails with the original Google Glass. Lastly, if you’re curious when Pixel phone design might change again, perhaps away from big camera bumps, design chief Ivy Ross told Bloomberg that the company tries on new design languages “every two to three years.” That means it’s due."

    "full_text": "The carpet performance isn't particularly impressive, so it'll be a better option for those with hard flooring. Dirt Devil BD5700V: For those with primarily hardwood flooring, the Dirt Devil BD5700V delivered one of the highest scores we've seen on a cordless vacuum, removing nearly 100% of sand from a hardwood floor. The Dirt Devil BD5700V is notable for its classic bright red accents and remarkably lightweight body. Dustbin size could also be bigger; it's only 0.48 liters, meaning more frequent emptying during cleaning sessions. Levoit LVAC-200 also comes with a two-in-one crevice tool and a two-in-one pet tool to help clean up any and every mess, although it would have been nice to have some additional attachments for cleaning upholstery or digging deeper into carpet for pet hair. It only lasted 25 minutes during our testing, so you'll want to take a look at the Shark Stratos and Dreame Z30 for cordless vacuums that can last an hour or more. Shark Pet Plus: We still recommend this one for those who want a good vacuum without spending more than $400. It delivers strong suction on all our test surfaces, has HEPA filtration and comes with Shark's generous five-year warranty. Tineco does great work with cordless vacs and the Pure One S15 Pet is fantastic. A small but much-appreciated feature of the LG CordZero A949 is that it's freestanding."

Elon Musk’s X is tentatively settling a class action lawsuit filed by workers who were let go soon after he purchased Twitter. This news comes in the form of a court filing where both parties asked the court to delay an upcoming hearing so that they could work out a deal. After buying Twitter in 2022, Musk laid off over 6,000 Twitter employees, reducing the company’s headcount by around 80%. While Musk offered three months’ severance, the lawsuit claims that many former employees didn’t receive complete payments, while some didn’t receive any payment at all. The lawsuit also alleges that Musk’s offer of three months’ severance was lower than what employees expected from a Twitter severance plan that had been in place since 2019, which would have guaranteed senior employees severance of up to six months’ base pay, plus one week of pay per year of service. But in July, a U.S. District Judge in San Francisco ruled that Musk did not have to honor the severance agreements that these employees had entered with Twitter. The plaintiffs appealed the ruling, however, and the parties were set to enter oral arguments in a court of appeals next month before requesting that the hearing be delayed.

    "summary": "\nThe Apple iPhone event is nearly here, which means we'll soon get to download iOS 26 and iPadOS 26. The OS 26es are coming with huge upgrades to your iPhone and iPad's operating systems. You've heard of Liquid Glass, right? It's like the better-executed version of Windows Vista and definitely one of the cooler features coming this fall. We spent two weeks test-driving it — you can check out our detailed hands-on iOS 26 preview, or you can try it out yourself by downloading and installing the public beta 4. That software is a more stable iteration of the separate developer version, which recently hit the beta 7 waypoint, and offers a few more flashy features not yet available in the public version. (While the public beta is open to everyone and quite stable, always remember there's a degree of risk involved with beta software.) Additionally, there are credible reports that iOS 26 could bring a new live translation feature to AirPods, too. Not sure if you want to upgrade your smartphone or tablet this year? No worries, we'll help you find out if your devices will be able to run iOS 26.\nWhile Apple didn't nix any iPhones from its eligibility list last year, that's not the case for 2025 — a few models are getting cut this time. All iPhone 8 models and the iPhone X were the last to get the boot in 2023, and this year the 2018 models are getting left behind. If you have an ineligible device, you won't be able to download iOS 26 when it becomes available this fall. \nWe'll get to the bottom of which iPhones and iPads will support iOS 26 and iPadOS 26 this year. To see what's coming with the latest OSes, check out everything announced at Apple's WWDC June 9 event. One thing you shouldn't immediately expect is Apple's updated version of Siri, though the company is reportedly working on a 'stripped-down' AI chatbot to compete with ChatGPT. \nThese three iPhones won't be compatible with iOS 26\nUnlike last year, several iPhone models won't be eligible to download the newest iOS when it makes its debut this fall. This trio of models first released in 2018 won't be coming to the iOS 26 party:\n\niPhone XR\niPhone XS\niPhone XS Max\n\niPhones compatible with iOS 26\nWhile we don't yet know the new iPhones Apple will be dropping this fall — though there are iPhone 17 rumors — we do know, per Apple's site, that the phones listed below will be compatible with iOS 26. Basically, if you have an iPhone that was announced in 2019 or later, you're in the clear:\n\niPhone SE (second generation or later)\niPhone 11\niPhone 11 Pro\niPhone 11 Pro Max\niPhone 12\niPhone 12 mini\niPhone 12 Pro\niPhone 12 Pro Max\niPhone 13\niPhone 13 mini\niPhone 13 Pro\niPhone 13 Pro Max\niPhone 14\niPhone 14 Plus\niPhone 14 Pro\niPhone 14 Pro Max\niPhone 15\niPhone 15 Plus\niPhone 15 Pro\niPhone 15 Pro Max\niPhone 16\niPhone 16 Plus\niPhone 16 Pro\niPhone 16 Pro Max\niPhone 16e\n\niPads compatible with iPadOS 26\nThe iPads listed below, and any iPads released later this year, are eligible to download iPadOS 26.\n\niPad Pro (M4)\niPad Pro 12.9‑inch (3rd generation and later)\niPad Pro 11‑inch (1st generation and later)\niPad Air (3rd generation and later, including M2 and M3)\niPad (8th generation and later, including A16)\niPad mini (5th generation and later, including A17 Pro)\n\nWhat if I don't want to buy a new iPhone?\nIf you want to continue using your older iPhone that isn't supported by iOS 26, that's fine. However, you'll miss out on security updates which could potentially put your phone at risk for malware and other threats. Additionally, some apps may stop working if they require a certain version of iOS or later. And of course, you won't be able to access the latest features iOS 26 offers.\nWhen will iOS 26 become available?\nApple usually rolls out its latest iOS in mid-September, just a few days before the new iPhones hit store shelves. Last year, it released iOS 18 on Monday, Sept. 16. Expect a confirmation of the release date at the iPhone 17 event, expected in early September. \niOS 26 features we're excited about\nLiquid Glass design: Your home screen is getting revamped with new app icons, including dark mode and all-clear options. You'll also notice buttons with a new floating design. Liquid Glass was designed to make all of Apple's OSes more cohesive.\nPhone app redesign: You'll finally be able to scroll through contacts, recent calls and voicemail messages all on one screen. It also comes with a new feature called Hold Assist that'll notify you when an agent comes to the phone so you can avoid the elevator music.\nLive Translate: iOS 26 is bringing the ability to have a conversation via phone call or text message with someone who speaks another language. Live Translate will translate your conversation in real time. \nPolls feature: Coming to group messages in the Messages app, chat members will be able to create polls. This can help prevent the unwanted 30+ messages when it comes to deciding which restaurant you're meeting at this weekend.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/apples-new-ios-26-public-beta-4-is-here-but-is-your-iphone-compatible-check-this-list-191854764.html?src=rss",

    "full_text": "Look-alikes of Apple products often pop up in China, and mixed-reality headsets have now joined the party. Chinese smartphone maker Vivo has introduced the Vivo Vision, a headset that mixes AR and VR and bears many similarities to the Apple Vision Pro. But it also has some differences -- an 180-degree panoramic field of view and a much lighter weight at 398 grams (versus the Vision Pro's 650 grams). CNET asked Vivo if it plans to sell the Vivo Vision to non-China markets, but the company did not immediately respond. The starting cost in China will be relatively cheaper at $1,395 (converted to US dollars), compared to the Vision Pro at $3,500. Even if the Vivo Vision were made available in the US, it might not matter much to Apple's bottom line. Jon Rettinger, a tech influencer with more than 1.65 million YouTube subscribers, says he's not overly enthusiastic about VR/AR just yet. \"If the technology can go from goggles to glasses, I think we'll see a significant rise. But if the current form factors stay, it will always be niche. \"The Quest is such a better value proposition, and even there it runs into issues with long-term retention and ultimately living in a drawer once the honeymoon period ends,\" he said."

I also use it for searing meats like chicken thighs and pork cops. This Le Creuset sauté pan has seen years of good use. I love that it’s big enough to cook a beef stew or a whole batch of soup, while also easy to just scramble eggs in. The best thing is how much surface area it has, which makes browning meats easy to do in one batch. Plus, its super deep sides mean I can cook a one-pot meal in it without things flying out the sides when I’m stirring. My grandmother was a professional cook, and she swore by Le Creuset pans. I also have not been a model Le Creuset owner; the enamel inside is far from pristine, but I still use it all the time and don’t see any need to replace it. As someone who reviews the latest tech gadgets — many of which, in the best-case scenario, have a 10-year lifespan — pulling out a 20-year-old pan each night to cook dinner gives me a nice feeling of permanence and tradition."

    "full_text": "The explosion of AI tools worldwide is increasing exponentially, but the companies that make these tools often don't express their environmental impact in detail. Google has just released a technical paper detailing measurements for energy, emissions and water use of its Gemini AI prompts. According to its methodology for measuring AI's impact, a single prompt's energy consumption is about the equivalent of watching TV for less than 9 seconds. That's quite in a single serving, except when you consider the variety of chatbots being used, with billions of prompts easily sent every day. According to the tech giant, that's not unsubstantial, and it's a momentum that will need to be maintained going forward. Google did not immediately respond to CNET's request for further comment. For comparison, it's estimated that only using the active TPU and GPU consumption, a single Gemini prompt uses 0.10 watt-hours of energy, 0.12 milliliters of water and emits 0.02 grams of carbon dioxide equivalent. With more considerations in place, a Gemini text prompt uses 0.24Wh of energy, 0.26mL of water and emits 0.03 gCO2e -- around double across the board. Through a multilayered series of efficiencies, Google is continually working on ways to make AI's impact less burdensome, from more efficient model architectures and data centers to custom hardware. With smarter models, use cases and tools emerging daily, those efficiencies will be critical as we immerse ourselves deeper in this AI reality."

    "summary": "The latest and greatest of the foldable phone world. (Google, Sam Rutherford/Engadget)\nLast month, the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 was released and immediately became the de facto king of the foldable phone hill. But now a new challenger has arrived: The Pixel 10 Pro Fold. The full details are now available in the wake of Google's splashy launch event, which debuted the Fold alongside the full new Pixel 10 line, a new Pixel smartwatch and two new earbuds, too (see everything Google announced). But the Pixel 10 Pro Fold was the star of the show, and it's vying with the Z Fold 7 for the title of best foldable — both offer very similar designs, but each bringing something unique to the table.\nSamsung launched its first foldable phone in 2019, so it's had quite a bit of time to refine the Galaxy Fold over the years. Google on the other hand just released its first Pixel Fold a couple years ago — but has already largely evened the match. And, of course, with enhanced Gemini AI software integration front and center, you'll have access to Google's impressive artificial intelligence features at nearly every turn.\nWe'll break down how the Pixel 10 Pro Fold and Galaxy Z Fold 7 stack up to one another. You can also check out our comparison of the Pixel 9 Pro Fold and the Galaxy Fold 6 to see how much has changed in a year. \nPrice\nFirst things first, how much will one of these high-tech folding phones cost you? That is the make-or-break question, after all. The newest Pixel foldable is still less expensive than this year's Z Fold: it starts at $1,799 while the Galaxy smartphone starts at $2,000.\nYou don't have any other real choices for \"book-style\" foldables in the US market. The OnePlus Open can be had for $1,499, but it's almost two years old. And Apple's most expensive phone is currently the $1,599 1TB iPhone 16 Pro Max — but as a non-foldable model with just a single screen, it's hardly a straight comparison. If the rumor mill is to be believed, Apple may finally bow a foldable iPhone in 2026.\nDimensions and display\nIt's a race for the largest display and Samsung won this time — but not by much. The Galaxy Z Fold is just a hair bigger than the Pixel Pro Fold. Both phones' inner displays are 8 inches across when fully opened, while Samsung comes out ahead on the outer display with 6.5 inches (the Pixel is 6.4 inches).\nAs for height, the new foldable Pixel phone is 6.1 inches and the Galaxy Z is 6.2 inches — not a huge difference there. When unfolded, the Samsung wins on size efficiency, packing the identically sized 8-inch internal display into an area that's 0.3 inches smaller — 5.6 inches versus the Pixel's 5.9.\nThis year, the Pixel 10 Pro Fold’s displays have been upgraded to a Super Actua Flex OLED display with ultra-thin glass. Both the front screen and back cover come equipped with Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2.\nAs for the Galaxy Z Fold 7, it has a Dynamic AMOLED display (inner and outer) and comes with the Corning Gorilla Glass Ceramic 2 on the front and the Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on the backside. The glass is ultra-thin, yet it's 50 percent thicker than before.\nWhile slightly bigger, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 is still lighter than the Pixel 10 Pro Fold. The Samsung model weighs only 7.6 ounces — down nearly an ounce from its 2024 model — while its Google competition comes in at 9.1 ounces (the same as last year's model).\nThe Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 (left) compared to the new Pixel 10 Pro Fold (right). (Sam Rutherford/Engadget)\nProcessor, RAM, storage and battery\nThe Pixel 10 Fold Pro runs the Tensor G5 chip — Google says its CPU features 34 percent better performance compared to the Tensor G4 chip.\nThe Z Fold 7 is powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy. \"Everything feels fast and snappy,\" Engadget's Sam Rutherford said of the Snapdragon 8 Elite performance on the Z Fold 7. (Sam also has first impressions of the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, but speed tests will happen a bit later.)\nBoth phones offer the choice of 256GB, 512GB or 1TB storage. On the RAM front, the Pixel Fold delivers 16GB across the line, while the Samsung model reserves that level for the top 1TB storage tier; the small models get 12GB instead. The Galaxy phone will cost you $2,419 if you decide you need the maximum amount of storage, whereas the Pixel Fold tops out at $2,149.\nWhen it comes to battery life, Samsung's foldable lasts up to 24 hours with a 4,400mAh battery. The Pixel lasts up to 30 hours thanks to a more capacious 5,015mAh battery rating. Furthermore, the Pixel Fold is certified for Qi2 wireless charging, which Google is branding as \"Pixelsnap\" across its 2025 Pixel line for the first time.\nCameras\nFor many shoppers, a phone is only as good as its cameras, and both of these phones bring a strong lens game. Each has three rear cameras, though they're different aesthetically. You'll notice the Pixel has a larger camera bump with two rows, while the Galaxy has a thinner vertical line of cameras.\nThe Pixel 10 Pro Fold's rear camera array consists of a 48MP wide sensor, a 10.5MP ultrawide and a 10.8MP telephoto with 5x optical zoom. All three offer \"Super Res Zoom\" up to 20x with optical and electronic image stabilization. Per our own Sam Rutherford, the potential drawback here is that Google played it safe: \"The biggest potential shortcoming of the P10PF is that its camera hardware is largely staying the same. Granted, that's not a huge deal because the previous model had the best photo quality of any foldable phone.\"\nBy comparison, the Samsung Galaxy Fold 7 rear camera trio includes the same 200MP wide-angle camera as the company's Galaxy S25 Ultra, but carries over the 12MP ultrawide and 10MP telephone from the Z Fold 6. Zoom levels are 3x optical and 30x digital.\nWhile we have yet to put the Pixel 10 Pro Fold cameras through their paces, Sam was still liking last year's Pixel Fold versus the Galaxy Z Fold 7 when he reviewed the latter: \"At night, the Fold 7's shots remained surprisingly sharp. I still prefer the Pixel 9 Pro Fold due to its more accurate white balance and often sharper focus, though Samsung's phone isn't far behind.\" And the entire Pixel line's cameras are (of course) supercharged with some new Google Gemini AI niceties, like the Camera Coach feature that enables voice-controlled photo editing. \nBoth the Pixel and Galaxy offer similar 10MP specs on their front and inner selfie cameras. \nColor options\nIf you like having multiple colors to choose from, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 is winning in this category. It comes in Mint, Jetblack, Blue Shadow and Silver Shadow. Mint is only available if you buy your phone online — you won't be seeing that one in stores.\nAs for the Pixel 10 Fold Pro, your options are Moonstone and Jade.\nFull specs comparison\nGoogle Pixel 10 Pro Fold\nSamsung Galaxy Z Fold 7\nStarting price\n$1,799\n$2,000\nDimensions\nFolded: 6.1 x 3.0 x 0.4 inches (155.2 x 76.3 x 10.8mm)Unfolded: 6.1 x 5.9 x 0.2 inches (155.2 x 150.4 x 5.2mm)\nFolded: 6.2 x 2.9 x 0.4 inches (158.4 x 72.8 x 8.9mm)Unfolded: 6.2 x 5.6 x 0.2 inches (158.4 x 143.2 x 4.2mm)\nWeight\n9.1 oz (258g)\n7.6 oz (215g)\nProcessor\nTensor G5\nSnapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy (3nm)\nDisplay\nInner: 8-inch Super ActuaOuter: 6.4-inch Actua\nInner: 8-inch Dynamic AMOLEDOuter: 6.5-inch Dynamic AMOLED\nStorage\n256GB / 512GB / 1TB\n256GB / 512GB / 1TB\nRAM\n16GB\n12GB (for 256GB, 512GB configs) | 16GB (for 1TB config)\nBattery\n5,015mAh | \"Up to 30 hours\"\n4,400mAh | \"Up to 24 hours\"\nCamera\nMain: 48MP wide (F1.7) | 10.5MP Ultrawide (F2.2) | 10.8MP Telephoto lens (F3.1) with 5x optical | Super Res Zoom up to 20xFront: 10MP (F2.2)Inner: 10 MP (F2.2)\nMain: 200MP Wide (F1.7) | 12MP Ultrawide (F2.2) | 10 MP (F2.4) Telephoto (F2.4) with 3x optical zoomFront: 10MP (F2.2)Inner: 10MP (F2.2)\nStylus support\nNo\nNo\nColors\nMoonstone, Jade\nMint (online only), Jetblack, Blue Shadow, Silver Shadow\n\nUpdated August 21, 2:26PM ET: Added a section comparing the cameras on both phones.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/google-pixel-10-pro-fold-vs-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-how-the-newest-foldable-phones-stack-up-165018793.html?src=rss",

For aforementioned reasons, I can't test all of these, but I've already had a play around with the feature and can confirm it did a very effective job of translating my garbled messages into French. The model Honor has deployed was designed by the company in collaboration with Shanghai Jiao Tong University, based on the open-source Whisper model, said Fei Fang, president of product at Honor in an interview. \"We also work together with industry language experts to consistently and comprehensively evaluate the accuracy of our output,\" she added. It means that everything is processed locally and your calls will therefore remain completely confidential. The work Honor has done on AI call translation is set to be recognized at the upcoming Interspeech conference on speech science and tech. But already, Honor is thinking about how this use of AI can be used to enable other new and exciting features for the people who buy its phones. \"Beyond the essential user scenario of call translation, Honor's on-device large speech model will also be deployed in scenarios such as face-to-face translation [and] AI subtitles,\" said Fang. The process of developing the speech model has allowed Honor's AI team to gain extensive experience of model optimization, which it will use to develop other AI applications, she added."

Since aurora borealis comes from the effect that geomagnetic storms have on the Earth's magnetic field, we could know when auroras are happening much further in advance.

Ty Pendlebury/CNET You can buy the Legion Go S with Steam OS for $100 more right now, but it has lower specs. While my dog wasn't impressed by the lack of walking we were doing, I had a real blast just killing time (and bad guys). It's the more casual games that work best on this device, and I can plug in for a few minutes, get some frags and get on with my day. While my PC and Xbox are still great, it's not always convenient to game in the ways I want. Until now, I'd stream them from my PC into the living room using Steam Link. The lack of a keyboard has another downside: It's not possible to do shortcuts as easily. It's a matter of learning a bunch of new buttons, and forget about navigating with the onboard \"pointer\" -- it's awkward and quite imprecise."

The non-GPT version of Copilot produced a decent rendering that would have helped as a reference photo, while GPT-5's output was noticeably richer and more vivid, with stronger perspective. It wasn't a radical improvement, but you could still see the upgrade in image quality.

But it’s also part of a welcome trend: 2025 is shaping up to be the year that several long-in-development games finally see the light of day. While both Routine and Metroid Prime 4 seem to have suffered from the technical and design difficulties that can plague the development of big, complex games — at one point Nintendo’s senior managing executive officer Shinya Takahashi called Metroid’s development “very challenged” — that hasn’t been the case for Silksong. “It was never stuck or anything,” Team Cherry co-founder Ari Gibson told Bloomberg. There wasn’t any big controversial moment behind it.” Of course, there’s another long-in-the-works game that was originally slated to launch in 2025 but has since been pushed back: Grand Theft Auto VI. You could even throw the latest chapters of Deltarune onto that list. Is the sequel to Beyond Good & Evil really still alive? When will Stardew Valley’s creator launch his next game, Haunted Chocolatier? What’s up with the next Elder Scrolls and Half-Life 3?"

For anyone weighing an upgrade, the real question is how the base Pixel 10 stacks up against last year’s Pixel 9. You’ll no longer have to clamp your phone in a car mount or precisely place it on a wireless charging pad. The ring of magnets provides a perfect alignment every time, eliminating the frustration of waking up to a dead phone because it was slightly misaligned. It’s the kind of upgrade that gradually rewires your habits, making the Pixel 10 feel more integrated into your daily routine than any of its predecessors. It’s nice being able to attach and detach your favorite accessories in seconds. Without one, you don’t get the reach or portrait framing a telephoto camera provides. That’s a big deal if you’ve ever tried to take a photo with digital zoom, which often results in mushy details. The Pixel 10’s main and ultrawide cameras are actually a bit smaller than what you’d find in the Pixel 9. That said, Google’s new Tensor G5 chip promises to produce higher quality images and videos, so the 10 may keep up with the 9 just fine."

It’s exactly what I’ve been wanting for Windows-powered handheld gaming PCs for years now, but it still feels like a small first step in a grand next-gen Xbox plan. The Game Bar drives a lot of Microsoft’s Xbox full-screen experience. You also have the option to keep switching between both modes without those performance savings. This is still a Windows 11 device after all, which means there are OS updates and notifications from other apps or storefronts to install that might break the immersion. Microsoft wouldn’t comment on what this setting is for just yet. But I did play some Gears of War: Reloaded on one of the demo units on the floor and noticed the game crash, leaving me with a broken game app window instead of a more gracious home screen like you see when games crash on an Xbox Series X console. Unfortunately, I didn’t get a chance to fully test how Windows standby and hibernation work with games on the Xbox Ally. I love the experience of turning my Xbox Series X off and then being able to immediately resume a game hours or days later, and Microsoft doesn’t have the equivalent of Quick Resume on Windows devices.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration requires automakers to report crashes involving advanced driver assist features “within one or five days” of the incident, but Tesla was reporting crashes “several months or more” after they occurred, the agency said. Tesla has told NHTSA’s Office of Defects Investigation that the delays were the result of a problem with its data collection that has since been fixed. The rule dates back to a standing general order (SGO) from 2021 that requires automakers and robotaxi companies to report crashes involving fully autonomous vehicles as well as Level 2 driver-assist systems. Under the SGO, companies are required to document collisions when an automated driving system was in use within 30 seconds of impact and report those incidents to the government. Since it was implemented, Tesla has reported over 2,300 crashes to the federal government, according to NHTSA. An analysis of the crash data shows Tesla accounted for 40 out of 43 fatal crashes reported under the SGO. Tesla’s Autopilot and Full Self-Driving features are considered Level 2 automated technology that requires full driver attention.

    "summary": "It's up for this star who's in one of the top box office films of the summer, and two Netflix Top 10 hits of the week.",
    "full_text": "For the week of Aug. 11, two vastly different films, both featuring Vanessa Kirby, are in the US Top 10: Netflix original Night Always Comes and Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw. 4 at the box office, and she briefly reprised her role as White Widow in Mission: Impossible -- The Final Reckoning, which also arrived on digital platforms this week, the actor seems to be everywhere. The fact that Kirby is starring in two of Netflix's top films at the moment feels like a bit of a homecoming. In the time since, Kirby has starred in three massive film franchises that have raised her profile in Hollywood, but she also started her own production company that struck a deal with Netflix so that smaller, woman-led projects like Night Always Comes would have a home. 4 on Netflix's Top 10, is an anxiety-riddled thriller about a woman (Kirby) who has 24 hours to come up with the $25,000 she needs to buy the house she rents and shares with her mother and brother. The film is a dark and desperate look at a woman who is barely scraping by and trying to do right by her family but is forced to collect money by any means necessary -- calling in favors, begging for loans, even selling her body, just so she can maintain a sense of normalcy and stability at home. The grim reality of Night Always Comes is diametrically opposed to 2019's Hobbs & Shaw, the outrageously fun buddy-action film where Kirby plays Jason Statham's sister Hattie Shaw. Her performance alongside Statham and Dwayne Johnson has helped propel that film to the No. (That in itself seems impressive, but it almost seems as though Hobbs & Shaw has taken on a life of its own and has gone beyond any other entry in the Fast & Furious franchise. Fans -- and the film's original writer -- have been hoping for a sequel for years, and the film handily stands on its own.)"

From the new Tensor G5 processor, faster charging and various new AI tools, the Pixel 10 Pro range has been refined in almost every way. Yet the design looks familiar, sporting an almost identical aesthetic to last year's model. Do I mind? Not at all -- I loved the Pixel 9 Pro, and I don't think its design needed overhauling just one generation later. The Pixel 10 Pro and 10 Pro XL go on sale on Aug. 28 from $999 and $1,199, respectively, though there are some preorder deals happening now to help you save."

The new capability, which is already available on TikTok, makes it easier for viewers to follow and discover related content. Now if a creator is telling a story in a series of videos and follow-ups, they can link them all together so that viewers don’t have to scroll or search for different parts. While the new feature is great for linking different parts of a saga, it could also be used to group together similar videos. For example, if a creator is doing a series where they’re baking a bunch of fall recipes, they can now group them all together so they’re easier to find. After a creator links reels together in a series, users will be able to navigate to the next reel using a new button located at the bottom left of the reel. Instagram says the new feature was highly requested and that it will allow for richer storytelling while also keeping audiences engaged longer, which could lead to increased watch time. The social network says it could also help turn casual viewers into followers. While the new feature isn’t a huge change, it’s a welcome addition for both creators and viewers, as it makes it easier to find and follow along with content on the platform.

Since most households require two pizzas per order, you could be saving roughly $28 every time that craving hits. Making the bubbly stuff with SodaStream will cost you far less than buying cans of seltzer. But you might not have considered how these countertop convection ovens can also save money on your energy bill. By my calculations using New York's electricity prices (2023), a standard four-quart air fryer costs 25 cents per hour to run. Best of all, a decent rice cooker won't cost you more than $25. The multicookers are easy to use and will turn tough, cheaper cuts of meats into meals you can cut with a butter knife. Beyond the Instant Pot's prowess for turning budget ingredients into toothsome food, these lil' cookers also use less energy than a wall oven. We did the math to see how much you can save using an Instant Pot over a big oven. We crunched the numbers to see exactly how much making coffee at home will save you in a year."

There were trustworthy-sounding claims from a Nintendo Direct in April that the title would launch this year, which gave fresh hope (and fresh patience) to the punishing platformer's players. Even with a launch date now provided, though, there's always the chance for it to be postponed again. So let's keep the mood at \"cautiously optimistic.\""

    "summary": "Sony's WH-1000XM5 once topped our lists of best noise-canceling headphones and best wireless headphones, and were only usurped by the follow-up XM6. This line of headphones is consistently impressive and the WH-1000XM is truly in a league of its own. So we get excited when one of the all-around best headphones out there goes on an aggressive sale. You can pick up a pair of XM5s right now for just $274, which is 32 percent off its normal retail price of $400.\n \nIn our review of the XM5 we awarded a score of 95 out of 100, impressed with just about every aspect of the set with the notable exception of its price, which makes a sale like this all the more exciting. The XM5s are supremely comfortable, thanks to a slim cushioned headband and soft earcups. In our review, we had no problem wearing them for hours at a time and never felt uncomfortable pressure on the ears or head. \n30mm carbon-fiber drivers deliver excellent audio, delivering a wide and immersive soundstage. The XM5 carries eight total microphones as part of its active noise-canceling system, up from four on the previous model, and delivers top-of-class ANC.\nThe battery life on these headphones is best in class, with around 30 hours of listening per charge. Touch controls on the outside panel of the right ear cup help you control your music with ease, allowing you to play, pause, skip tracks and adjust the volume right from the headphones. The only real downside at this point is you’re buying a pair of headphones that are three years old; the XM6 offers some noteworthy improvements. But, of course, it’ll cost you.\nIf you've been thinking about upgrading your headphones, or picking up your first pair of real high-quality cans, then take advantage of these savings. The sale price of $274 applies to the black model only, though the other colors are 18 percent off, selling for $328.\nFollow @EngadgetDeals on X for the latest tech deals and buying advice.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/sonys-wh-1000xm5-headphones-are-32-percent-off-ahead-of-labor-day-143447083.html?src=rss",

The company announced Thursday that the streaming service will now cost $13 a month in the US, effective today. The last time Apple raised its streaming subscription price was in 2023, bumping it up to $10 per month. If you're an existing subscriber, you can expect to see the price change 30 days after your next renewal date. Apple said the cost of its annual Apple TV Plus plan will stay the same, as will the price for Apple One. Early this year, the streaming app rolled out on Android mobile devices, extending it beyond Apple's interconnected ecosystem. Apple TV Plus offers its own library of originals like Severance, Slow Horses and Wolfs, and access to live sports such as Major League Soccer and Friday Night Baseball. Competitors like Netflix and Peacock also increased their subscription prices this year, a trend we've seen in streaming TV in the past three years. With this $3 price hike, the ad-free Apple TV Plus costs the same as Paramount Plus' premium plan, but slightly less than rival, ad-free versions of Netflix, HBO Max, Hulu and Peacock."

This is just the latest update in the lengthy legal saga between Masimo and Apple, which started when the former sued the iPhonemaker in 2021, accusing it of infringing on several of its light-based blood oxygen monitoring patents. After a court sided with Masimo in 2023, Apple was forced to stop selling the Watch Series 9 and the Ultra 2 in the US for a few weeks. \nIn order to circumvent the import ban for the devices, Apple removed the Blood Oxygen app for the watch models sold in the US. Just a few days ago, however, the company introduced a \"redesigned Blood Oxygen feature\" for the Watch Series 9, Series 10 and Watch Ultra 2 models. The feature works by measuring and calculating data from the watches' sensors on their paired iPhones instead.

    "summary": "Chinese action camera (and now drone) company Insta360 has unveiled a premium addition to its lineup of compact cameras. The Insta360 GO Ultra is being billed as a new, more powerful product line in the GO series, instead of a replacement for the GO 3S.\nThis next generation represents a substantial step up in performance, powered by a new 5nm AI chip, which is a big jump from the 14nm chip found on the GO 3S. It also benefits from a larger 1/1.28-inch sensor, roughly twice the size of the one in the 3S. All of this unlocks better image quality with support for HDR, 4K capture at 60 fps and double the frame rate of the 3S. The Ultra also offers PureVideo, an enhancement that uses AI-powered algorithms to reduce noise and increase brightness in low-light captures.\nThe form factor for the Ultra is largely the same as the 3S, with a compact camera body that can be optionally housed in an Action Pod that offers additional battery life and a 2.5-inch flip touchscreen for live camera view. The Ultra weighs 53 grams (around 1.9 ounces), 14 grams more than the 3S, and sports a square body, as opposed to the pill-like shape of the 3S.\nThe slightly larger body means a 70-minute standalone battery life, which is just over 80 percent more than the 38 minutes on the 3S. The Action Pod extends this to 200 minutes. The Ultra also offers removable storage, expandable up to 2TB.\nLike most Insta360 cameras, much of the design is geared toward action shots for the more adventurous among us. The GO Ultra's IPX8 rating means it's waterproof down to 33 feet underwater. A magnetic clip system makes it easy to attach the GO Ultra to a piece of clothing or equipment and start capturing your adventure in 4K.\nThe Insta360 GO Ultra is available now worldwide for $450.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cameras/insta360-launches-new-action-camera-with-removable-storage-130019177.html?src=rss",

The form factor for the Ultra is largely the same as the 3S, with a compact camera body that can be optionally housed in an Action Pod that offers additional battery life and a 2.5-inch flip touchscreen for live camera view. The Action Pod extends this to 200 minutes. The Ultra also offers removable storage, expandable up to 2TB. Like most Insta360 cameras, much of the design is geared toward action shots for the more adventurous among us. A magnetic clip system makes it easy to attach the GO Ultra to a piece of clothing or equipment and start capturing your adventure in 4K. The Insta360 GO Ultra is available now worldwide for $450."

    "summary": "Chinese regulators reportedly dissuaded local companies from purchasing NVIDIA's H20 chips, because they found certain statements by US commerce secretary Howard Lutnick \"insulting.\" According to the Financial Times, the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC), the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) and the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) teamed up to intensify their efforts to push the use of homegrown chips following Lutnick's remarks in an interview with CNBC. \nThe US, if you'll recall, blocked NVIDIA from selling its H20 chips to China back in April out of concern that the Chinese military would use them to develop AI technology. When the US government reversed its decision in July and allowed the company to start shipping its chips to China, Lutnick told CNBC: \"We don't sell them our best stuff, not our second best stuff, not even our third best. The fourth one down, we want to keep China using it... The idea is the Chinese are more than capable of building their own. You want to keep one step ahead of what they can build, so they keep buying our chips. You want to sell the Chinese enough that their developers get addicted to the American technology stack. That's the thinking.\" To note, a previous Times report stated that the government allowed NVIDIA to ship its products to China again after agreeing to hand over 15 percent of its profits.\nAs a response to Lutnick's remarks, the Times says Chinese authorities sought ways to prevent local companies from buying H20 chips. CAC issued an informal notice instructing China's biggest tech firms, such as ByteDance and Alibaba, to stop new orders for H20 chips until the government is done conducting a national security review. The companies are compelled to comply, because they could face substantial fines from the CAC if they don't. Meanwhile, NDRC also issued an informal notice, asking local tech companies not to purchase any NVIDIA chip. \nReuters recently reported that NVIDIA is developing a new chip for the Chinese market that's more powerful than the H20, perhaps driven in part by China's move to discourage its purchase. It will be based on the company's Blackwell architecture, but will only be capable of half the computing power of NVIDIA's Blackwell Ultra GPUs. Their regulatory and export approval aren't guaranteed, but the president previously implied that he was aware of the project and said he expects NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang to talk to him about it. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/china-reportedly-discouraged-purchase-of-nvidia-ai-chips-due-to-insulting-lutnick-statements-123055120.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "If you’ve been shocked by how much you spend on streaming services lately, you’re not alone. Companies like Netflix, Disney, Max and others have been consistently raising prices to the point where you may question if streaming is even worth it anymore. We at Engadget still think it is, but we also think you should be smart with your money — and that’s where streaming deals come in.\nYes, it is possible to get discounts on services like Peacock and Paramount+, even if those deals aren’t as common as a sale on AirPods. If you’re looking to save money and still stream all of the content you want, Engadget can help by laying out the best streaming deals you can get right now, how you can save with bundles and everything you should know before paying for yet another streaming service. \nBest streaming deals\nTrue streaming deals can be hard to come by. Most often, they’ll pop up during the Black Friday shopping period. On occasion, we’ll see them sparingly throughout the year and they usually take the form of a discounted monthly or annual rate for a limited period of time. Also, true streaming deals are typically on the ad-supported versions of a service, but once in a while you’ll find a unicorn of a deal on a tier that has ad-free viewing.\nIf you’re able to wait for a deal before subscribing to a streaming service, we recommend doing so. You’ll save money upfront and in the long run, and you also have the option to cancel your subscription before the price goes back up to the normal rate. Maybe you find you like the service so much that you’re fine paying full price for it — that’s the ideal situation. But if you’re not compelled to keep that app on rotation in your smart TV, most streaming services make it easy for you to cancel at any time. With that said, these are the best streaming deals you can snag right now.\n \nDirecTV starting at $50/month for one month ($35 off): All of DirecTV's signature packages are $35 off right now for your first month when you sign up. If you opt for the base \"Entertainment\" package, you'll spend $50 for the first month and get access to over 90 channels, including many local stations as well as ESPN, ESPN 2 and Fox Sports 1. You'll also be able to watch on the go with the DirecTV mobile app.\nDashPass Annual + HBO Max (with ads) for $96/year ($144 off): This offer includes access to HBO Max with ads for no extra cost when you sign up for a DashPass Annual plan. You can then decide to upgrade to Max Standard, which removes ads, for a discounted rate of $11 monthly if you want. Aside from the obvious streaming benefits, this deal gives you $0 deliver fees and lower service fees on some restaurant DoorDash orders, five percent DoorDash credits on pickup orders, on-demand grocery delivery and other members-only exclusives.\nSpotify Premium Individual (3 month) for $0 ($36 off): This is our favorite music streaming service for podcasts and social features. Right now, users who have not signed up for Spotify's Premium service before are eligible to get three months for free. The Premium Individual plan lets you listen ad-free and skip songs at will. You can also organize your listening queue and download content for offline listening. Just be aware, your subscription will auto-renew at the end of the trial period. So if you don't want to be on the hook for the $12 monthly fee, set a reminder to cancel and go back to the free version.\nFubo Pro for $55/month for the first month ($30 off): Fubo has introductory discounts on most of its packages, and the Pro package is the least expensive plan currently listed. It offers access to 224 channels, unlimited cloud DVR and up to 10 simultaneous streams. It even includes regional sports content from the NHL, MLB and NBA.\nYouTube TV (three months) for $150 ($99 off): You can get three months of our favorite live TV streaming service for $50 per month. That should give you a decent chunk of time to see if the service is right for you while saving some cash. The discount and trial are only open to new subscribers to YouTube TV’s base plan, which includes access to over 100 channels, unlimited DVR space and six household accounts with the ability to stream on three devices at once. \nSling Orange for $23/month for the first month (50 percent off): New customers can get Sling Orange or Sling Blue for half off the usual price for the first month, bringing the final prices to $23/month and $25.50/month, respectively. Orange is likely best for sports fans, with eight exclusive sports and family channels, while Blue includes 19 exclusive news and entertainment channels. You can get both Orange and Blue access also for half off for one month, or $33 total.\nPeacock first responders discount — one year for $48 (50 percent off): Medical professionals and first responders can save 50 percent each year of Peacock. The deal requires annual verification and is open to those who work for either private or public institutions. Peacock has some great stuff to watch, including Poker Face and Killing It and more.\nStudent discounts on streaming services\nHBO Max student discount — subscribe for $5/month (50 percent off): HBO Max offers their ad-supported tier to students for half off the usual rate. You’ll just have to verify that you’re a student through Unidays, and make note that this offer is only good for up to 12 months of service.\nHulu student discount — subscribe for $2/month (75 percent off): Those with a valid student ID can get Hulu’s ad-supported tier for 75 percent off the typical rate. They’ll keep the same sale price for as long as they’re a student as well.\nSpotify student discount — Premium + Hulu with ads for $6/month (72 percent off): Spotify’s student offer continues to be one of the best around, giving you access to the Premium tier of the music streamer and Hulu’s ad-supported plan for only $6 monthly. Purchased separately, you’d pay $22 per month for both of the services. Plus, the first month is free when you sign up.\nNBA League Pass student discount — one year for $120 (40 percent off): Students can get one year of League Pass for only $10 per month, which includes access to NBA TV and the ability to watch classic and archive games on-demand. On the NBA League Pass website, look for the student discount banner at the top and follow the instructions to verify your student status.\nStreaming bundle discounts\nThere’s more consolidation happening now than ever before in the streaming space, and that means there are more streaming bundle options. These bundles offer you access to more content with one subscription price, but those prices are typically higher than paying for a single service by itself (obviously). It may be tempting to just get the bundle, but if only one of those services in the bundle speaks to you, you’ll spend less overall by just paying for the single service.\nSpeaking of a deep love for a single streaming service: if all of your favorite shows are on Peacock or the latest releases on HBO Max consistently bring you joy, consider paying for one year upfront. Subscribing with an annual plan usually saves you money in the long term over paying on a monthly basis. Unfortunately, not all streaming services (looking at you, Netflix) have an annual subscription option. Here are some of the best streaming bundles you can get right now.\n \nDisney+, Hulu, HBO Max bundle with ads for $17/month: Ad-supported HBO Max is included here, along with full, ad-supported access to Disney+ and Hulu. You’ll save 43 percent with this bundle, as opposed to paying for all three services individually.\nDisney+ and Hulu Bundle Premium for $20/month: Disney and Hulu offer a few different bundles, which you can view in the drop-down lists under Choose Your Plan. This bundle removes the ads from both Disney+ and Hulu (with the exception of select live and linear content) and allows you to download content for offline viewing. You’ll save 42 percent with this bundle, as opposed to paying for both ad-free tiers individually.\nHulu + Live TV with Disney+ and ESPN+ for $96/month: This streaming bundle amalgamation is a bit confusing but it does offer a lot: you get live TV streaming via Hulu’s service plus access to the following VOD services: Hulu, Disney+ and ESPN+. Out of those three, only ESPN+ will have ads.\nDisney+, Hulu, ESPN+ Bundle Basic for $17/month: You get full access to Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+ content with this package, albeit with ads across the board. This bundle price is 46 percent off the total price of all three separate subscriptions.\nDisney+, Hulu, ESPN+ Bundle Premium for $27/month: Similarly to the Duo bundles, the Premium version of the Trio removes ads from most content in Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+, and you can download content for offline viewing. This price represents a 43-percent savings when compared to paying for all three ad-free tiers separately.\nSling TV + HBO Max starting at $53/month: Sling TV and HBO Max have partnered on a discount that gives new subscribers 50 percent off their first month of Sling TV, plus $5 off monthly when you subscribe to the Sling TV + HBO Max bundle. The standard price for the Sling Blue + HBO Max duo is roughly $58/month, so you'll get a monthly discount of $5 off that. In addition, for the first month only, you'll get half off the price of the bundle. The promotion also applies to the Sling Orange & Blue + HBO Max package, which has a standard price of $73/month.\nParamount+ with Showtime for $13/month or $120/year: This includes everything in Paramount+’s Essential plan, except the ads, and also provides access to Showtime content, live CBS streams and download features.\nRead more streaming coverage\n\nThe best live TV streaming services to cut cable\nThe best streaming services: Netflix, Hulu, HBO Max and more\nThe best streaming devices\n\nFollow @EngadgetDeals on X for the latest tech deals and buying advice.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/best-streaming-service-deals-133028980.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Apple’s next big to-do for 2025 will be the upcoming iPhone 17 event, which will likely happen some time in September. Historically, the company uses those events to announce new iPhones, AirPods and Apple Watches — MacBooks tend to get their own, separate shindig (though we do expect the new macOS 26 software to come out around that time). For now, the most recent MacBooks are the M4 MacBook Air and the M4 MacBook Pro. Deciding between just two models may seem easy, but there are still plenty of variables to consider before you add one to your cart — screen size, chip capabilities, price and memory configurations will all come into play. We’ve reviewed every MacBook model to come out in the last 17 years or so, so we compiled this guide to help you pick the best MacBook for you.\nTable of contents\n\nBest MacBooks for 2025\nWhat about budget MacBooks?\nFactors to consider when buying a MacBook\nMacBooks specs comparison chart\nBest MacBook FAQs\n\nBest MacBooks for 2025\n \n \nWhat about budget MacBooks?\nHistorically, Apple kept the previous year’s MacBook Air in its lineup as a sort of budget option. But the company took a different approach with the release of the M4 MacBook Air. Instead of continuing to sell the older model, Apple discontinued the M3 Air and gave its newest computer a $100 price cut. \nNow, if you can even find a brand new M3 MacBook Air (typically from retailers like Amazon or B&H), it’s often more expensive than the M4 version. During sales like Amazon Prime Day, we’ve seen the newest M4 Air go for as little as $799. That effectively makes our overall pick a budget pick as well.\nOf course, $800 isn’t exactly a small investment either for college students or others on a budget. Especially when you can find some decent PCs for under $500. If you’re looking to save even more on a MacBook, we recommend checking out refurbished options directly from Apple, or even third party sellers like BackMarket. There are a few guidelines to keep in mind, which we go over in our refurbished guide, but mainly, you’ll want to shop from a reputable source that has a stated process and offers at least a year-long warranty. Using your old gear as a trade-in will bring down your final cost as well.\nFactors to consider when buying a MacBook\nCompared to PCs, Apple computers tend to have more streamlined specifications. The company has long been known for this simplicity, and the M-series “system-on-a-chip” condenses things even further. Prior to the M1 chip, Apple used Intel chips in its laptop and desktop computers. The M2 and M3 generations followed that first chip and currently sells MacBooks equipped with M4-series chips. You’ll find the standard M4 processor in the Air and the base-model Pro and the upgraded M4 Max and M4 Pro chips as options for the MacBook Pro (currently there is no M4 Ultra chip, as there was with the M3 series in the Mac Studio). All M-series chips combine, among other technologies, the CPU, graphics card and unified memory (RAM). Apple’s Neural Engine is included too, which is a specialized group of processor cores that handles machine learning tasks such as image analysis and voice recognition.\nWhile a unified chip means you have fewer decisions to make when picking a MacBook, there are still a few factors to consider, including specs like the number of CPU cores, amount of RAM, storage capacity, screen size, and, obviously, price. The finish color may be a minor consideration, but it's worth pointing out that the Pro comes in just two colors (Silver or Space Black) but the Air comes in four hues (Midnight, Starlight, Sky Blue and Silver).\nCPU cores\nThe lowest-specced chip in a current-lineup MacBook is the standard M4 chip, which is found in all models of the MacBook Air and the base model MacBook Pro 14-inch. That chip houses a 10-core CPU and either an 8- or 10-core GPU. In total, there are three versions of the M4 chip: standard M4, M4 Pro and M4 Max (which are each a step up from their predecessors, the M3, M3 Pro and M3 Max chips). The burliest chip, the M4 Max is built with either a 14- or 16-core CPU and a 32- or 40-core GPU. \nCores are, in essence, smaller processing units that can handle different tasks simultaneously. Having more of them translates to the computer being able to run multiple programs and applications at once, while also smoothly processing demanding tasks like video and photo editing and high-level gaming. In short, more cores allow for more advanced computing and better performance. But if your processing power needs fall below professional-level gaming and cinematic video and audio editing, getting the highest number of cores is likely overkill — and after all, more cores equals higher cost and more power usage.\n\n\n\n\n   Photo by Devindra Hardawar/Engadget \n \n\nRAM\nYour options for RAM, or in Apple’s terminology, unified memory, varies, but with the switch to the M4 chip in all laptops, the lowest amount of RAM you can get is now 16GB. That’s a necessary spec-bump to accommodate the tech world’s favorite feature of the moment: AI or, in this case, Apple Intelligence (still AI, but Cupertino’s version). The M4 Pro chip has 24 or 48GB memory options, while the M4 Max chip supports 48, 64 or a whopping 128GB of RAM.\nYou’ve likely heard the analogy comparing memory to the amount of workspace available on a literal desktop surface, whereas storage is the amount of drawers you have to store projects to work on later. The larger the worktop surface, the more projects you can work on at once. The bigger the drawers, the more you can save for later.\nIn addition to supporting Apple Intelligence, more RAM is ideal for people who plan to work in multiple apps at once. And the more demanding each program is, the more RAM will be required. Extra memory can also come in handy if you’re the type who likes to have infinite numbers of tabs open on your browser. If your daily workflow doesn’t involve simultaneously using a vast number of memory-intensive programs, you can save yourself money and buy the RAM configuration that you’re most likely to actually use.\nFor a long time, Apple continued to offer MacBooks with just 8GB of RAM, and we recommended upgrading to at least 16GB of RAM. With this being the standard today, grabbing a base model should be fine for most non-pro-level users. One thing to note is that, unlike most PCs, the RAM in a MacBook is not user-upgradable since it’s tied into the system-on-a-chip. If you think you might end up needing more memory, you should go for the spec upgrade up front.\nStorage capacity (SSD)\nStorage options range from 256GB of SSD for the base-model MacBook Air and 8TB of storage for the MacBook Pros with the M4 Max chip. If you want to rotate between a long roster of game titles or keep lots of high-res videos on hand, you’ll want more storage. If you’re mostly working with browser- and cloud-based applications, you can get away with a smaller-capacity configuration. That said, we recommend springing for 512GB of storage or more, if it’s within your budget. You’ll quickly feel the limits of a 256GB machine as it ages since the operating system alone takes up a good portion of that space. Having 1TB will feel even roomier and allow for more data storage over the life of your laptop.\nWhen Apple announced the iPhone 15, the company also announced new iCloud+ storage storage plans, with subscriptions that allow up to 12TB of storage shared among your iOS and MacOS devices. You could also transfer files to an external storage device. But if you don’t want to pay for a monthly subscription and prefer the convenience of having immediate access to your files, it’s best to get the highest amount of storage space your budget allows for at the outset.\nScreen size\nThe MacBook Air comes in 13- or 15-inch sizes. Pro models have either 14- or 16-inch screens. A two-inch delta may not seem like much but, as Engadget’s Nathan Ingraham noted when he reviewed the then-new 15-inch M2-powered MacBook Air, a larger screen \"makes a surprising difference.” That’s especially true if you plan to use your laptop as an all-day productivity machine and won’t be using an external monitor. More space means you can more clearly view side-by-side windows and have a more immersive experience when watching shows or gaming.\nBut screen size is one of the main factors influencing weight. The 13-inch MacBook Air M4 weighs 2.7 pounds, whereas the top-end 16-inch MacBook Pro with the Max chip weighs 4.7 pounds. If you plan to travel a lot or swap your work locations regularly, a smaller screen will make life easier in the long run.\nAll MacBooks feature IPS LCD panels (in-plane switching, liquid crystal display), which Apple markets as Retina displays. The MacBook Air M4 has a Liquid Retina display and the Pro models have Liquid Retina XDR displays. “Liquid” refers to the way the lighted portion of the display “flows” within the contours of the screen, filling the rounded corners and curving around the camera notch. “XDR” is what Apple calls HDR (high dynamic range).\nYou also get the option of a standard or nano-texture display on the MacBook Pro. The glass, which reduces glare and is also available on the Studio Display, iMac and iPad Pro, comes with a $150 price increase, but if you really don’t like reflections on your screen, it could be worth it.\nCompared to most other laptops, MacBook displays are notably bright, sharp and lush. But one feature worth pointing out is another Apple marketing term: ProMotion. It’s the company’s term to describe a screen with a higher, 120Hz refresh rate, which results in smoother scrolling and more fluid-looking graphics. Only MacBook Pros offer ProMotion; the Air maxes out at 60Hz, which is perfectly fine for everyday browsing and typical workdays. But if you want buttery-smooth motion from your display, you’ll have to shell out more money for an upgrade.\nOperating systems\nSoftware considerations won’t make much of a difference when deciding between MacBook models — all come with macOS installed. But if you’re switching from, say, a Windows PC, the operating system may be something to factor into your decision — though it’s probably less of an issue than it once was. Now that so much of the work we do on our computers is browser- and cloud-based, the learning curve between the two platforms isn’t as steep. Apps and programs like Gmail perform similarly regardless of what computer you’re using. Apple machines have historically had more limited support of AAA gaming titles, but even that is changing with more AAA games and better graphics coming to Macs.\nAs for macOS, it’s getting better too. With macOS Tahoe 26, the Spotlight function is more advanced, making it easier to find apps and perform tasks straight from your keyboard. The software also implements Apple's unifying Liquid Glass design for a modern look that looks consistent across iOS and iPad devices. New enhanced iPhone continuity features also make MacBooks and the handset work better together. A revamped Shortcuts app is more powerful as well, giving users custom automations that leverage Apple Intelligence (the company’s own AI).\nPrice\nWhen Apple announced the MacBook Air M4, it also delivered a bit of refreshing news: The latest model now starts $100 cheaper than the previous generation. So now, the least expensive MacBook is the 13-inch, M4-powered Air with 16GB of RAM and 256GB of storage for $999. Alternatively, you can spend up to $7,349 for the 16-inch MacBook Pro M4 Max with the nano-texture glass, 128GB of RAM and 8TB of storage. \nChip type, screen size, memory and storage capacity all influence the final price, which is why guides like this can help you determine just what you need (and what you don’t) so you can get the most cost-effective machine for you. AppleCare is another cost to consider. The extended warranty plan from Apple covers repairs from accidents and offers free battery replacement and starts at $3.50 per month or $35 per year for MacBooks. \nWe recommend the MacBook Air M4 for most people, and thanks to that $100 price cut, it’s also a good budget option. If you want something even cheaper, we recommend looking at refurbished M-series models from Apple. We think the 14- or 16-inch MacBook Pros are best for professionals. If you have extra money to spare once you’ve picked your machine, we recommend upgrading to at least 512GB of storage to make your machine as future-proof as possible. Of course, if you're just after the M4 chip and want the cheapest route to get it, you might consider the M4 Mac mini, which starts at $599 (though you'll have to supply the screen, mouse and keyboard).  \nBest MacBooks spec comparison chart\n\n\n\nProduct \nSuperlative \nTested configuration \nTested battery life \nRated battery life \n\n\nApple MacBook Air M4 (13-inch) \nBest MacBook overall \nApple M4, 16GB RAM, 256GB SSD \n18.25 hours \nUp to 18 hours \n\n\nApple MacBook Pro M4 (14-inch) \nBest MacBook for creatives \nApple M4, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD \n34.25 hours \nUp to 22 hours \n\n\n\nBest MacBook FAQs\nWhat's the difference between MacBook Air and Pro?\nBoth the MacBook Air and Pro models come with the M4 chip. MBP models have the option of more powerful M4 Pro or M4 Max chips. The Pro has a higher resolution screen with a higher peak brightness that supports up to 120Hz adaptive refresh rates and XDR (extreme dynamic range). The battery life on most Pro models is longer than on the Air models as well. Pro models also have more ports and more speakers. In short, the MacBook Air is aimed at everyday users looking for good productivity and entertainment capabilities, while Pro models are aimed at professionals who need a high-performance computer.\nWhat's the difference between macOS and Windows?\nMacOS is the operating system developed by Apple and used in all of its desktop and laptop computers. It can only be found in hardware made by Apple including MacBooks and iMacs. Microsoft’s Windows operating system can be found in the company’s own Surface laptops as well as computers made by a wide array of manufacturers, like Acer, Asus, Dell and Razer.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/best-macbook-140032524.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "With August already two-thirds out the door, it means we're getting closer to the Apple iPhone event, which typically takes place in September. During that event, we'll finally get to put our eyes on the iPhone 17 lineup.

MacRumors says this could be a revamped version of the much-maligned FineWoven case, which was discontinued due to being susceptible to scratches and stains.\nHere are the new TechWoven Cases for iPhone 17Full Article: https://t.co/UGMdYQWPJX pic.twitter.com/BftqiD03jO— Majin Bu (@MajinBuOfficial) August 20, 2025\n\nThe leaker noted there are two lanyard holes for \"convenient and secure carrying,\" so it could be worn around your neck.\nThis is just a rumor and we won't know what the actual iPhone 17 models or accessories will look like until Apple's iPhone event next month. That said, the shared photos (including the one embedded above) are more convincing than usual.\nHow much will the iPhone 17 cost?\nApple's announced plan to expand US-based manufacturing partners seems to give it at least some shielding from the steepest Trump administration tariffs that have already triggered price increases on everything from Switch consoles to high-end cameras to Sonos speakers. But given that President Trump's trade policies can change from week to week, and Apple's continuing reliance on Asia-based supply chains, price shocks remain an ongoing possibility. The bigger question is: Will Apple absorb any higher costs, or pass them on to consumers? \nIf prices do creep up, Apple may choose to pair it with an \"upgrade.\" Consider this recent rumor posted by MacRumors from a leaker known as \"Instant Digital,\" suggesting that the default storage of the iPhone 17 line may start at 256GB, doubling the current 128GB baseline. While that could be accompanied by a price increase of $50, Apple could at least pitch it as a \"better value.\" That said, the company doubled the default RAM of its Mac computers from 8GB to 16GB at no extra cost in 2024 — but that was before the current Trump tariff cycle started.\nWhen will the iPhone 17 series be announced?\nMost years, the flagship smartphones are introduced in September. MacRumors highlighted a story originally reported by iphone-ticker.de that the Apple iPhone 17 event could be Tuesday, September 9, according to information gleaned from German mobile phone providers.\nIt's still too early to have the specific dates; some years, Apple only gives a week or two of lead time between sending invites and hosting the event. But years of past precedent show that sometime in September should be when the 17 models make their debut. This family of smartphones may be the last to follow that trend, however. There have been hints that the introduction of the iPhone 18 collection in 2026 will be split into a pro-tier announcement in the fall and a standard model announcement the following spring.\nWhat will the new iPhone 17 lineup include?\nDesign leaks suggest that Apple is building an ultra-thin smartphone, likely to be named the iPhone 17 Air to match Apple's ultralight laptop designation. Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, often a solid source of advanced intel about Apple, reported in January that the iPhone 17 Air will be equipped with a basic A19 chip and will only have a single camera lens. It may also use Apple's new in-house modem, which was introduced in February on the iPhone 16e. More details about this development may leak ahead of September, but that's what we know for now.\nAn investor note from Apple analyst Jeff Pu indicated that the Air will have a titanium frame. If his reports are accurate, the lightweight smartphone will be the only entry in the iPhone 17 lineup to use that metal; the iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone 17 Pro Max are expected to be made of aluminum, which is oddly a lighter material than titanium. Other speculation had suggested that the Air would use a blend of aluminum and titanium, so the exact materials may not be known until the official announcement.\nAdditionally, an August 4 MacRumors report says the internal battery pack of the iPhone Air is just 2.49mm thick — half the thickness of the iPhone 17 Pro battery. The leak was posted on the Korean-language Naver blog, where they show the alleged batteries of the iPhone 17 Air and 17 Pro side by side. The same account claimed the 17 Air's battery capacity was a mere 2,800 mAh, MacRumors notes. (That's below the battery capacity of current iPhone 16 models.)\nOn a similar topic, an iPhone 17 Pro production leak appears to have revealed an all-aluminum chassis, according to MacRumors. Originally posted by leaker Majin Bu, the image shows a shell that has a large round hole on the back (where the Apple logo typically is) to allow for MagSafe charging. MacRumors says this could just be a molding but notes that the aluminum frame (versus the current titanium in Pro iPhone models) would yield a significantly lower weight.\nThat same leaker (Majin Bu), whom MacRumors classifies as a \"hit-or-miss leaker,\" suggests the iPhone 17 Pro will have better wireless signal strength thanks to an updated antenna design. The individual posted a render on X that shows a new antenna system that wraps around the iPhone 17 Pro's supposedly wider rear camera bump. Again, this is a render, not a real-world photo. That said, we can't knock the goal of better wireless reception, so we're hoping this one has a degree of truth to it.\nEach new roster includes a base model, but over the years, Apple has shaken up the variety of phones it offers. Most likely there will be an iPhone 17 and an iPhone 17 Pro. Apple has also committed to the size matters philosophy, and has been building an iPhone Pro Max option with an even bigger screen and better battery life; the 17 roster will almost certainly have one as well. \nThe new Pro iPhones are said to have a full-width \"camera island\" on the rear, which would mark the first time an Apple model opted for that design. This feature can be seen in the purported iPhone 17 \"spotted in the wild.\" The pics, highlighted on MacRumors, show a black cased iPhone (17 Pro?) with the distinct back panel. Is it the real deal? The dual angles lend a degree of credibility in a social media landscape increasingly polluted with AI-enhanced fakes, but your guess is as good as ours.\nI just spotted a test development iPhone in the wild 🤩🤩🤩 pic.twitter.com/iS3PtKWqxJ— Fox Pupy 🦊🧡 (@Skyfops) July 28, 2025\n\nThe iPhone 17 Air seems primed to take the place of a potential iPhone 17 Plus. Since the iPhone 16e was only just introduced in February at a surprisingly high price point, it seems unlikely that there will be a new addition to that lower end of the spectrum, the models that were previously called SE. \nAt the very least, it sounds like the iPhone 17 Air won't take away the charging port and rely only on wireless connectivity. Bloomberg said that while Apple had investigated making the iPhone 17 Air without a single port, the company (fortunately) changed plans. He also says that the rumored phone will have a 6.6-inch screen and include the Dynamic Island and Camera Control button. Finally, the price is rumored at $900 — likely more than the standard iPhone 17 but less than the Pro.\nWe've also gotten what seems to be a reliable look at what the color lineup will be for the new smartphones. Macworld reported that the iPhone 17 will be available in black, white, steel gray, green, purple and light blue. The iPhone 17 Air will reportedly have four color options: black, white, light blue and light gold. While the Air colors will be less saturated, the visuals for the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max will go bold. The options for the Pro models are expected to be black, white, gray, dark blue and orange.\nOn July 30, Tom's Guide highlighted an X post from Sonny Dickson — a longtime and generally reliable leaker of unreleased iPhone information — showing \"dummy\" iPhone 17 models in the new colors that were the source of the aforementioned Macworld story. While these are literally just mock-ups — not real, leaked iPhones — it's interesting to see how the design and color rumors translate into a real-world look and feel.\nTo add the the rumors, a Weibo leaker known as Digital Chat Station suggests the iPhone 17e will come equipped with a new design that includes the Dynamic Island, MacRumors reports. According to the post, the new phone will have the A19 chip and could have a 6.1-inch OLED display with a front-facing 12-megapixel camera and a rear-facing 48-megapixel camera. However, it's important to note this report refers to the 17e model that would be expected to launch no earlier than February 2026, if it followed the same release pattern as the iPhone 16e.\nWhat will iOS 26 be like?\nApple upended its numbering conventions with WWDC 2025, and will match the name of each new operating system to the year it's released. So when the next wave of iPhones hits, they'll be running on iOS 26.\nOn the design side, the smartphone OS introduced during the big developer showcase took a contentious approach dubbed Liquid Glass. Apple has been scaling down the amount of transparency effects in the subsequent beta tests of iOS 26, but it will still have a glass-like visual.\nThe feature list includes big and small updates. On the more impactful side, the Phone and Photos apps have been redesigned. There will be several features leveraging artificial intelligence, such as live translation capabilities coming to Phone, FaceTime and Messages. Apple is also currently testing a sensitive content warning for child accounts that will freeze FaceTime video if nudity is detected by on-device machine learning tools. And the company is also launching Visual Intelligence, which will use AI to search for elements in an image.\niOS 26 also has a litany of minor, quality of life improvements. Group texts are getting support for polls. And for the slow risers out there, iOS 26 will finally let you escape the tyranny of the nine minute snooze alarm. \nThe next iOS is now available as a public beta. Here are our initial impressions of the Liquid Glass design and other new features. iOS 26 is compatible with all models back through iPhone 11.\nWhat other products are expected to be released alongside the iPhone 17?\nIf Apple follows its usual pattern, the iPhone 17 will be announced alongside new Apple Watch products. That would be the Apple Watch Series 11 (if Apple sticks to the same naming scheme), and maybe an Apple Watch Ultra 3 and/or an updated Apple Watch SE. (They'll all run watchOS 26, of course.) Other possibilities — and this is, again, speculation — could include refreshed Apple AirPods Pro (which received its last big update in 2022) and maybe new AirTags trackers (first released in 2021).\nThe Apple rumor mill got a big shot in the arm this week thanks to the reported inclusion of product ID numbers in recent beta software builds. Per MacRumors, it's a laundry list of new hardware, including long-rumored product updates like the Apple TV, HomePod mini, new Apple Studio Display monitor and two fresh iPads. \nOf course, even if that list is totally accurate, we may not see those products until 2026 — if ever. So don't expect all of products to share the stage with the iPhone 17, especially since Apple likes to keep its star performer at the center of attention. \nThat said, keep in mind that Apple has recently been having Mac-centric announcements in late October (as it did last year to debut new M4 Macs), so there's always the chance of another shoe dropping a few weeks down the road.  \nUpdate, August 20, 2025, 7:12PM ET: Added new rumor about potential TechWoven case for iPhone 17 series.\nUpdate, August 18, 2025, 6:23PM ET: Added new rumor about the iPhone 17e potentially having the Dynamic Island.\nUpdate, August 15, 2025, 2:05PM ET: Added new rumor about the all-aluminum chassis on the iPhone 17.\nUpdate, August 13, 2025, 10:02PM ET: Added a list of the products that are expected to be released alongside the iPhone 17s. \nUpdate, August 11, 2025, 7:27PM ET: Added a render of a rumored new antenna design for the iPhone 17 Pro.\nUpdate, August 8, 2025, 4:43PM ET: Added new speculation and reports about iPhone 17 pricing.\nUpdate, August 6, 2025, 4:05PM ET: Added latest details about the potential iPhone 17 event date.\nUpdate, August 4, 2025, 5:23PM ET: Added latest battery leaks about the iPhone 17 models.\nUpdate, August 1, 2025, 8:15AM ET: Added new photos showing potential iPhone 17 colors.\nUpdate, July 30, 2025, 11:08AM ET: Added latest leaks and rumors about the iPhone 17, and updated information on the iOS 26 public beta.\nUpdate, July 17, 2025, 4:40PM ET: Added latest information about iOS 26, possible materials for the Air, and the color options for the different models.\nUpdate, March 17, 2025, 2PM ET: Added details about the rumored price and features of the iPhone 17 Air.\nUpdate, April 11, 2025, 3:45PM ET: Added details from Front Page Tech's new video that claims to reveal details from a leaked iOS 19 build.\nKatie Teague contributed to this story.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/apple-iphone-17-launch-date-is-rumored-for-september-everything-to-know-about-the-newest-lineup-153024220.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Liquid Glass is a huge new change coming to iOS 26. (Apple)\nIn just few weeks, Apple's annual iPhone event will likely be upon us, which means we'll finally get a look at the newest iPhone 17 lineup. In addition, the company will also give us an official date for downloading iOS 26. Until that happens, you can download and install the newly released public beta 4 (or iOS 26 developer beta 7 for developers). I've been playing around with it for the past couple of weeks, and have found that taking screenshots is way better in the new operating system — Google and ChatGPT search options are now in the screenshots editor, for instance. You can see a more complete view of the new features in our preview of the iOS 26 public beta release, which shows off the fresh home and lock screen redesign. Called Liquid Glass, the new translucent look will extend across all of Apple's upcoming operating systems. The overhaul is one of several big changes coming to iOS, macOS, iPadOS and the rest of Apple's software suite, all of which were showcased during the company's WWDC keynote on June 9.\nAfter overpromising on AI plans last year, Apple kept its iOS roadmap focused more on basic quality of life improvements this year. There are multiple useful additions coming to the Phone and Messages apps on your iPhone, for instance: Apple execs outlined the ability to weed out spam texts or other unknown senders and an option to hold your spot on a phone call when you've been waiting for a representative to pick up. Plus, a treasured feature that we took for granted is coming back (hint: it's in the Photos app).\nSiri, meanwhile, is in a holding pattern. Apple has previously specified that its smarter voice assistant — first promised at WWDC 2024 — is delayed until some point \"in the coming year,\" so you shouldn't expect any major changes in the current betas. But there are reports that Apple is aiming to give Siri a bigger brain transplant by basing it on third-party artificial intelligence models like OpenAI's ChatGPT or Anthropic's Claude, which could make 2026 a pivotal year. The company is also reportedly working on a 'stripped-down' AI chatbot to rival ChatGPT.\nWith each beta, it seems like additional new improvements are popping up, like this new AirPods gesture we're all curious about, and this FaceTime feature that'll freeze your video if it detects nudity. With the release of the iOS 26 developer beta 5, we saw more added features, like a new bouncy animation on the passcode screen and in the Control Center, MacRumors reports. Some or all of those changes will likely soon migrate into the separate public beta (see below). Most newer iPhone models are eligible to download iOS 26 (both the betas and final version). Want to see the full list of new features coming this fall? Read on. \nWhat is iOS 26?\nThe current iPhone operating system is iOS 18, and Apple is still actively updating it — version 18.6.1 was released to restore Apple Watch blood oxygen monitoring functionality for certain users in the US. More recently, Apple released 18.6.2 to address a vulnerability related to image processing. But don't expect to see iOS 19 soon — or ever. Instead, Apple is skipping the numbering ahead to iOS 26 later this year. The company has decided to line up its iOS version numbers with a year-based system, similar to car model years. So while iOS and its sibling operating systems will be released in late 2025, they're all designated \"26\" to reflect the year ahead. \nIt's official, we're moving to iOS 26. (Apple)\nWhat is Liquid Glass design?\nLet's be honest. Out of everything announced at WWDC this year, the new Liquid Glass design was the star of the show. The iPhone's home and lock screens have looked pretty much the same year after year — the last exciting thing (in my opinion) was the option to add your own aesthetic to your home screen by customizing your apps and widgets. So seeing the home and lock screens' new facelift is refreshing.\nSo what exactly is Liquid Glass? Apple calls it a \"new translucent material\" since, well, the apps and widgets are clear. However, the screen can still adapt to dark and light modes, depending on surroundings. You'll also notice buttons with a new floating design in several apps, like Phone and Maps. They're designed to be less distracting than the current buttons, but are still easy to see. While the design overhaul has proven to be controversial since its announcement, some — including Engadget's own Devindra Hardawar — like the new direction, even if it's somewhat reminiscent of Microsoft's translucent Windows Vista Aero designs from nearly twenty years ago.\nThat said, as of the release of the iOS 26 beta 2, Apple has already incorporated some user feedback into the design, dialing back the transparency in at least some places. And while it will continue to evolve, Apple users won't be able to escape it: Liquid Glass was designed to make all of Apple's OSes more cohesive. Here's a look at how the translucent aesthetic will look with the new macOS Tahoe 26 on your desktop.\nWhat are the new and notable features of iOS 26?\niOS 26 has a laundry list of new features. Among the most worthwhile:\nPhone app redesign: You'll finally be able to scroll through contacts, recent calls and voicemail messages all on one screen. It also comes with a new feature called Hold Assist that'll notify you when an agent comes to the phone so you can avoid the elevator music and continue on with other tasks.\nLive Translation in Phone, FaceTime and Messages: iOS 26 is bringing the ability to have a conversation via phone call or text message with someone who speaks another language. Live Translation will translate your conversation in real time, which results in some stop-and-go interactions in the examples Apple shared during its presentation.\nPolls in group chats: Tired of sorting through what seems like hundreds of messages in your group chat? You and your friends will soon be able to create polls in group messages for deciding things like which brunch spot you're eating at or whose car you're taking on a road trip.\nFiltering unknown senders in Messages: If you haven't received spam texts about unpaid tolls or other citations, you're lucky. For those of us who have, those annoying messages will soon be filtered away in a separate folder.\nVisual Intelligence: Similar to a reverse Google image search, this new feature will allow you to search for anything that's on your iPhone screen. For instance, if you spot a pair of shoes someone is wearing in an Instagram photo, you can screenshot it and use Visual Intelligence to find those shoes (or similar ones) online.\nPhotos tabs are back: For anyone who's still frustrated with the Photos changes made last year, you'll be happy to know that your tabs are coming back. Library and Collections will have their own separate spaces so you don't have to scroll to infinity to find what you're looking for.\nFaceTime \"Communication Safety\" feature: A newer addition to iOS 26 appears to be the FaceTime \"Communication Safety\" feature that pauses communications if and when nudity is detected. The feature appears to be a child safety feature that uses on-device detection, thus obviating any cloud-based privacy issues. \nNew lock screen options: The iPhone lock screen gets more customizable in iOS 26, with a cooler clock, 3D wallpaper effects, more widgets and better focus mode options. \nApple's Hold Assist will be nifty for those pesky services that put you on hold for 10 or more minutes. (Apple)\nNew changes coming to iPadOS 26\nYour iPad isn't getting left behind when it comes to big updates. Here's what's coming this fall.\nMultitasking and real windowing: When you download the newest update, you'll be able to have multiple apps running on your screen at the same time. Once you open an app, it'll appear on your screen as normal but you'll be able to resize and move it across your screen to make room for other apps. This feature is optional so you can turn it off if you don't like it.\nVisual update: Along with the other new OSes, iPadOS 26 is coming with the Liquid Glass aesthetic. This new look will appear on the lock and home screens, as well as the drop-down menus.\nNew menu bar: When you swipe down on your screen, the new menu bar will appear with options like File, Edit, Windows and more. There's also a search option if you're looking for something specific.\nCheck out our first impressions of iPadOS 26. \nWhat about AirPods?\nAirPods are also getting updated with iOS 26. Here are some of the more notable functions.\nEnhanced audio recording: Apple calls this \"studio-quality\" audio recording, and with it, you'll notice more clarity while in noisy environments.\nCamera remote control: Using this, you can take a photo or start and stop video recording with just one press on your AirPods. When taking photos, you'll get a three-second countdown before your iPhone or iPad snaps the picture.\nLive translation feature: While not officially announced or confirmed, it appears that the long-rumored live translation for AirPods could be coming with iOS 26. The evidence comes from a system asset spotted in the in iOS 26 beta showing a gesture that's triggered by pressing both earbud stems at the same time. The photo also shows words in several different languages. \nWhich iPhones will be able to upgrade to iOS 26?\nA few iPhone models that run the current version of iOS — iPhone XR, XS and XS Max — won't be compatible with the latest upgrade. But any iPhones released in 2019 or later will be eligible for the iOS 26 update.\n\niPhone SE (second generation or later)\niPhone 11\niPhone 11 Pro\niPhone 11 Pro Max\niPhone 12\niPhone 12 mini\niPhone 12 Pro\niPhone 12 Pro Max\niPhone 13\niPhone 13 mini\niPhone 13 Pro\niPhone 13 Pro Max\niPhone 14\niPhone 14 Plus\niPhone 14 Pro\niPhone 14 Pro Max\niPhone 15\niPhone 15 Plus\niPhone 15 Pro\niPhone 15 Pro Max\niPhone 16\niPhone 16 Plus\niPhone 16 Pro\niPhone 16 Pro Max\niPhone 16e\n\nNot listed here are the presumed new iPhone 17 models (or maybe iPhone 26?) that are all but certain to be announced and released in September. \nHow to install iOS 26 beta\nThe iOS 26 public beta is now available to download via the Apple Beta Software Program. If you're not already a member, you'll need to sign up to try out all the latest features. Just visit beta.apple.com and sign up with your phone number or email address. It's free.\nOnce you're in, you can install it by going to Settings > General > Software Update and selecting iOS 26 public beta. \nA word of caution: Don't sign up with your main iPhone unless you're OK with any risks that occur with using an OS that isn't finalized.\nWhen will the final version of iOS 26 be released?\niOS 26 will be released to the public this fall. It usually comes in September, within a week of the Apple iPhone event. Last year, it rolled out to iPhone users on September 16 — exactly one week after the iPhone 16 lineup was announced.\nIf you're more interested in the Apple Intelligence features coming, here's everything Apple revealed for iOS, macOS and more during WWDC.

    "summary": "Welcome to Video Games Weekly on Engadget. Expect a new story every Monday or Tuesday (or Wednesday, whatever), broken into two parts. The first is a space for short essays and ramblings about video game trends and related topics from me, Jess Conditt, a reporter who's covered the industry for more than 13 years. The second contains the video game stories from the past week that you need to know about, including some headlines from outside of Engadget.\nPlease enjoy — and I'll see you next week.\n\nOn a planet shrouded in myth, in a land surrounded by lore, on a mountain draped in mystery, in a cave suffocated by secrets, the legend sleeps. For six years, the legend has slumbered while wild stories spiral around it, twisting and expanding and entwining. New words have been born and old words infused with evolved meanings: Believer. Doubter. Silkpost. The lies have grown so thick they’ve become corporeal, spreading trickery with a name and a dead smile.For six years, the legend has slept while the masses roiled, all of them waiting for the signal to awaken and know truth. All of them waiting for a bell that will ring, finally and clearly, on Thursday, August 21, 2025.Skong. Skong. Skong.\nIt’s a special time in the Silksong subreddit. After years of silence around its sequel, Hollow Knight: Silksong, Team Cherry has scheduled a livestream with a “special announcement” about the game for August 21 at 10:30AM ET. Not only is this exciting for Metroidvania fans everywhere, but it’s also possible that this announcement marks the final moments of the Silksong subreddit as we know it. A strange cocktail of game delays, inconsistent updates and hyper-focused cult fandom has cultivated a fascinating little universe in r/Silksong, complete with its own rules, villains and heroes. It’s a place where clown wigs are commonplace and contributors have turned trolling into a role-playing artform. A LARPform, if you will. It’s a place that’s consistently made me laugh every time it’s appeared in my feed over the past year or so.\nAhead of Thursday’s special announcement, this sub is experiencing the last gasps of desperate myth-making and hopeless anticipation before it transforms into something else entirely, armed with actual information about the sequel, gameplay videos and maybe even a firm release date. Or, dare I say it, a surprise launch. For just a moment longer in r/Silksong, anything is possible.\nAnd then it’ll be over. No matter what happens during Thursday’s livestream, the day will come when Silksong comes out and the drip-feed of silkposts dries up completely. But for now, our face paint is ready. Sometimes it’s just nice to recognize the madness and the beauty of the moment, before it slips away for good.\nUpdate August 21, 11:30AM ET: It happened. Hollow Knight: Silksong is due out on September 4.\n\n\nThe news\nNews from ONL 2025\nGamescom 2025 kicked off on Tuesday with Opening Night Live, a showcase hosted by Geoff Keighley and the folks behind The Game Awards, and there were plenty of delightful morsels on display. Engadget UK Bureau Chief Mat Smith is on the ground at Gamescom in Cologne, Germany, to play upcoming titles and talk to developers, but for now, here are our headlines straight out of ONL 2025:\n\nDenshattack! is a blend of Tony Hawk, trains and shonen anime\nBattlestar Galactica might finally get the video game adaption it deserves\nAbsolum is awesome and I can't wait to play it on October 9\nCall of Duty: Black Ops 7 arrives on November 14\nFromSoft's Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice is becoming an anime\nFallout season two has a teaser trailer and a December 17 release date\nBlack Myth: Zhong Kui is the next title from Game Science Studio\nCult of the Lamb's next DLC is Woolhaven, out in early 2026\nIndiana Jones and the Great Circle is coming to the Switch 2\n\nAnd our headlines from Gamescom 2025 so far:\n\nOnimusha: Way of the Sword might be a more forgiving kind of samurai epic\nResident Evil Requiem feels very familiar, but it's so well made that I respect the hell out of it\nEngadget's Gamescom Opening Night Live 2025 liveblog\nHow to watch Gamescom 2025 and what to expect\n\nGamescom 2025 runs through August 24.\nROG Xbox Ally lands in October\nMicrosoft is slowly establishing its handheld era with news that the ROG Xbox Ally and ROG Xbox Ally X will be available on October 16. There’s still no official word on how much they’ll cost, but there are hints: As spotted by Wario64, Best Buy recently listed the Xbox Ally at $550 and the Xbox Ally X at $900, and these fall in line with our predictions, which were based on the prices of existing ROG Ally handhelds. Alongside the release date, Microsoft announced the Handheld Compatibility Program, an initiative aimed at optimizing games for portable devices and informing players about how well they perform. It’s essentially Steam Deck Verified, but for Xbox handhelds, and it’s yet another sign that Microsoft’s portable gaming ambitions stretch beyond just one hardware manufacturer.\nThe PS5 will cost more tomorrow than it does today\nFirst Nintendo and Microsoft raised the prices of their latest consoles, and now it’s Sony’s turn. Sony on Wednesday announced the following price increases for the PS5 family:\n\nStandard PS5 with a disc drive: $550, up from $500\nPS5 digital edition: $500, up from $450\nPS5 Pro: $750, up from $700\n\nSony blames the increases on a “challenging economic environment,” echoing sentiments from its contemporaries. The price hikes come at a time in the hardware generation when we’re used to seeing consoles get cheaper, which just makes this whole thing more frustrating.\nRod Fergusson is in charge of BioShock again and already making big changes\nThere have been signs of turmoil at BioShock 4 studio Cloud Chamber for a while now, including news earlier this month that the game failed a review with 2K executives and was due for a complete narrative revamp. Now, we’re seeing even more fallout. Former Gears of War and Diablo head Rod Fergusson has left Blizzard to lead development of BioShock 4 at Cloud Chamber, and his appointment comes alongside news that 80 people at the studio are being laid off. This is actually the second time Fergusson has joined the development of a BioShock game at the last second — he similarly swooped in and cut aspects of BioShock: Infinite at Irrational Games in 2012.\nThe race through development hell between Judas and BioShock 4 continues.\nBlizzard’s cinematic and narrative team is unionizing\nMicrosoft is the home of another video game union. Workers with Blizzard Entertainment’s Story and Franchise Development team, which handles in-game cinematics and lore for titles including Overwatch and World of Warcraft, voted this week to unionize under the Communications Workers of America. This covers about 169 developers and it marks the fourth unionization effort from Microsoft’s gaming teams, joining QA workers at Activision, ZeniMax and Raven Software.\nSteam censorship is breaking PayPal\nPayPal isn’t a valid way to buy games on Steam in certain countries any longer. Steam in July removed hundreds of games with adult and NSFW themes from its storefront, and updated its policies to ban \"content that may violate the rules and standards” of its payment processors. This was incredibly vague and raised immediate concerns around financial censorship, especially when combined with a related culling of thousands of games from Itch.io. Now, it’s confirmed that PayPal has terminated its partnership with Steam in multiple countries, affecting any denomination “other than EUR, CAD, GBP, JPY, AUD and USD.”\nValve says it’s being pressured by payment processors including Visa, MasterCard and PayPal to remove certain games and implement puritanical censorship policies, and this has already resulted in at least one game being unjustly removed from the platform. That game, VILE: Exhumed, is now available as shareware.\nRoblox is changing its rules after so, so many child-safety lawsuits\nRoblox is locking down its system for sharing and viewing user-generated games following a wave of lawsuits accusing developers of failing to protect their young userbase. All unrated experiences, or user-created games, will be restricted to the developer and anyone actively working on them, rather than being available to anyone over the age of 13, as is currently the case. This change and others, including a new system that automatically detects and tracks \"violative scenes\" on individual servers, will roll out over the coming months.\nAnalogue delayed its N64 remake again\nIt’s now due out in Q4 2025. :(\nAdditional reading\n\nKris Holt’s indie game roundup\nMore action than RPG, Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 struggles to convince after a few hours' play by Robert Purchese at Eurogamer\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/video-games-weekly-silksong-and-gamescom-221635822.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "We've heard a lot this year about AI enabling new scams, from celebrity deepfakes on Facebook to hackers impersonating government officials. However, a new report suggests that AI also poses a fraud risk from the other direction — easily falling for scams that human users are much more likely to catch.\nThe report, titled \"Scamlexity,\" comes from a cybersecurity startup called Guardio, which produces a browser extension designed to catch scams in real time. Its findings are concerned with so-called \"agentic AI\" browsers like Opera Neon, which browse the internet for you and come back with results. Agentic AI claims to be able to work on complex tasks, like building a website or planning a trip, while users kick back.\nThere's a huge problem here from a security perspective: while humans are not always great at sorting fraud from reality, AI is even worse. A seemingly simple task like summarizing your emails or buying you something online comes with myriad opportunities to slip up. Lacking common sense, agentic AI may be prone to bumbling into obvious traps.\nThe researchers at Guardio tested this hypothesis using Perplexity's Comet AI browser, currently the only widely available agentic browser. Using a different AI, they spun up a fake website pretending to be Walmart, then navigated to it and told Comet to buy them an Apple Watch. Ignoring several clues that the site wasn't legit, including an obviously wonky logo and URL, Comet completed the purchase, handing over financial details in the process.\nIn another test, the study authors sent themselves an email pretending to be from Wells Fargo, containing a real phishing URL. Comet opened the link without raising any alarms and blithely dumped a bank username and password into the phishing site. A third test proved Comet susceptible to a prompt injection scam, in which a text box concealed in a phishing page ordered the AI to download a file.\nIt's just one set of tests, but the implications are sobering. Not only are agentic AI browsers susceptible to new types of scam, they may also be uniquely vulnerable to the oldest scams in the book. AI is built to do whatever its prompter wants, so if a human user doesn't notice the signs of a scam the first time they look, the AI won't serve as a guardrail.\nThis warning comes as every leader in the field bets big on agentic AI. Microsoft is adding Copilot to Edge, OpenAI debuted its Operator tool in January, and Google's Project Mariner has been in the works since last year. If developers don't start building better scam detection into their browsers, agentic AI risks becoming a massive blind spot at best — and a new attack vector at worst.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/ai-browsers-may-be-the-best-thing-that-ever-happened-to-scammers-220315936.html?src=rss",

The publication reported that Oracle has promised to develop tens of billions of dollars in data centers, which have become a hot business. Notably, Oracle landed a deal to back operations at OpenAI, in a partnership that will give the AI company 4.5 gigawatts of computing power. According to Bloomberg, that's enough energy to power \"millions of American homes.\"\nSo far, Oracle has seemed willing to throw money at its AI data center projects, no matter how expensive or irresponsible the needs might be. For instance, a source said the company plans to spend more than $1 billion a year powering a single data center in Texas with gas generators rather than waiting for a utility connection to be built. When completed, this data center is expected to be one of the largest known sites, with computing power of 1.4 gigawatts.\nIn addition to the huge monetary cost, such a project can also have negative human and environmental impact. The Elon Musk-owned xAI is under fire after a supercomputer for its artificial intelligence operations became a primary source of air pollution in Memphis thanks to methane-powered turbines. Other majors, including Google, Microsoft and Meta, have chosen to try nuclear power for their data center projects, which comes with its own potential complications and risks. \nPurely on the financial side, Oracle's decision to invest so much so quickly meant the company reported its first negative annual cash flow since 1990.

    "summary": "Analogue's 4K take on the Nintendo 64 is… still not quite here. The company announced its third delay to the Analogue 3D on Wednesday, pushing the retro system back to Q4 2025. However, it said that's an intentionally conservative estimate, so this probably isn't a huge concern.\nThe postponement follows previous ones in March and July. (The last time was due to tariffs.) Analogue acknowledged the frustration pre-order customers must be feeling. \"We know this sucks,\" the Pocket maker wrote. \"Another delay, announced late, after months of patience. We feel it too.\"\nThe Analogue 3D uses an FPGA (field programmable gate array) chip to emulate N64 hardware. The company promises it will work with every official N64 cartridge ever released without any slowdowns or inaccuracies.\nAnalogue\nSo, why bother with the $250 console when you can grab a used Nintendo 64 for under $100? Well, Analogue's take supports 4K output, variable refresh rate displays and both PAL and NTSC carts. It's also adding \"original display mode\" filters to simulate old-school TVs. (They're similar to those you find on the company's highly rated Analogue Pocket handheld console.)\nAnalogue says the system is 99 percent done — including hardware, system and packaging. \"The last 1% is where we're focused,\" the company wrote. It says it wants every detail to meet its high standards.

Startups like Group14 and its competitor Sila have accommodated silicon’s propensity to swell by creating structures that keep silicon in place without sacrificing the anode’s overall integrity. Group14’s material is a scaffold with internal voids that hold the silicon, giving it room to expand. The material itself can be blended with graphite or replace it entirely. Many companies still opt for the latter because of graphite’s inherent stability. Group14 says its material can improve energy density by up to 50% and cut fast-charging times below 10 minutes.

    "summary": "The Qi2 wireless charging spec was originally announced back in early 2023. However, Android phone makers haven’t exactly been rushing to add Qi2 support to their latest devices since then. That’s made finding a compatible handset rather difficult, which is a bummer for anyone who has seen the wealth of accessories and power banks that iPhone owners have had access to for several generations.\nOn top of faster charging speeds (up to 25 watts or higher in later revisions), Qi2 dictates the inclusion of embedded magnets designed to make aligning and attaching peripherals a cinch.\nBut what makes the slow rollout a bit more frustrating is that Apple is a member of the Wireless Power Consortium (the governing body in charge of Qi2) and its MagSafe tech was used to help define the spec and ensure that compliant add-ons work seamlessly with Qi2, so it’s not like there’s a lack of compatible peripherals.\nRegardless, to help you figure out which Android phones officially come with Qi2, we’ve compiled a list of supported devices. (Note: Due to the complexities of the Chinese market, this list is primarily focused on gadgets available in North America and the EU.)\nAndroid phones with Qi2:\n\nThe HMD Skyline.\nThe Google Pixel 10 family.\n\nThat’s it, seriously. Though now this list does include one of the biggest Android phone makers in Google.\nThat said, there is one wrinkle with the Pixel 10 line. While Google's Pixelsnap standard is Qi2 compatible, wireless charging speeds for the base Pixel 10 and Pixel 10 Pro are staying the same at 15 watts. However, only the Pixel 10 Pro XL comes with support for the more powerful Qi2.2 spec which allows for wireless charging at up to 25 watts. So if you want the convenience of cable-free magnetic charging and want to do it as fast as possible, you're going to have to pay extra for the most premium version of the Pixel 10. \nThe status of other Android phone manufacturers\nBut what about the Galaxy S25? Unfortunately, despite Samsung saying that it will release multiple “Android devices supporting Qi2” this year, its latest batch of flagship phones (including S25 Edge, Galaxy Z Flip 7 and Galaxy Z Fold 7) are merely \"Qi2 ready.\" But what does that mean? Like previous models, the Galaxy S25 family can charge wirelessly at up to 15 watts. However, because the phones don't have magnets on their back, Qi2 accessories slide off when you try to attach them. This can be addressed by purchasing a compatible case with a built-in magnetic mounting system or a magnetic ring mount, but at least out of the box, the Galaxy S25 line requires additional assistance in order to work with the growing market of Qi2 peripherals.\nOnePlus also claims the OnePlus 13 supports Qi2. However, in our testing, the magnets inside the phone are so weak that it didn't latch on securely to any of the Qi2 accessories we tested. However, similar to the Galaxy S25, if you pair the OnePlus 13 with one of the company's magnetic cases, you can attach Qi2 peripherals as normal. \nFinally, when asked if it had plans to release Qi2-compatible phones, Motorola would only say that it is \"committed to bringing the latest technology across our devices.\"\nAs new phones with Qi2 hit the market, we will try to keep this list as up-to-date as possible. Or at least until the spec becomes a much more mainstream standard.\nUpdate, August 20 2025, 4:45PM ET: This story has been updated with info about Qi2 support on the Pixel 10 family. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/here-are-all-the-android-phones-that-support-qi2-150052702.html?src=rss",

Some Indian and global investors are also calibrating their response, a person familiar with the matter told TechCrunch. The company, however, earlier clarified in a stock exchange filing (PDF) that it has “no direct exposure” to real-money gaming businesses and that these platforms do not contribute to its revenues based on its latest reported financials.

However, the self-regulation approach faltered due to conflicts among industry stakeholders over enforcement and standards.

And with the upcoming Resident Evil Requiem — or RE9 — appears to continue the series' current momentum in delivering compelling horror experiences.\nJust ahead of Gamescom 2025, I got to experience the opening of Resident Evil Requiem, focusing on new protagonist Grace Ashcroft (daughter of Alyssa Ashcroft from Resident Evil Outbreak) and her desperate attempt at fleeing a horrifying clinic within a strange mansion. Capcom's return to traditional survival horror was one of the best games showcased at Summer Game Fest 2025, and spending more time with it recently made me appreciate the series' renewed vision — even if it's a bit familiar.\n\nMuch like recent core entries in the Resident Evil series — VII and Village — Resident Evil Requiem places a keen focus on immersion, truly capturing that sense of dread as you walk down the halls of an unnerving facility. The larger story of Requiem seems to be pointing towards a homecoming of sorts for the series' most pivotal event — the destruction of Raccoon City in Resident Evil 2 and 3. While Requiem's story will expand into a more ambitious scope, the demo I played focused on Grace's harrowing attempt to escape her abductors.\nIn this sequence, Grace frees herself from an inverted hospital gurney and finds herself trapped in a ruined clinic filled with the bodies of dead doctors. In keeping with the brand of horror from the Resident Evil 2 remake and Resident Evil Village, I was being stalked by an imposing, grotesque monster hiding in the ceilings. Without weapons and with only empty bottles for distractions and sources of light to keep the beast at bay, the sequence felt very much like a stealth puzzle sequence, where I had to examine the movements of the beast and figure out a way to maneuver around it.\nI had previously seen this particular sequence during Summer Game Fest 2025. While I was impressed with its presentation — which features some of the most impressive lighting and character rendering I've seen from Capcom's RE Engine — I found the premise and scenario to be somewhat too familiar than I would have liked. Since Resident Evil VII, the series has leaned heavily into putting players in the series' most vulnerable moments, which often entail being stalked by imposing foes without any means to defend oneself.\nCapcom\nThat sense of vulnerability can often feel played out, especially within the current horror game space, where running away from things is its sub-genre. However, getting to play Resident Evil Requiem properly made me appreciate Capcom's attempt to maintain the momentum from Resident Evil VII. And a lot of that had to do with the fact that Requiem now stars a more fully defined protagonist. Ethan Winters from VII and Village was a faceless protagonist with somewhat generic motivations, but he gradually became more well-rounded by the end of his story in Village. Now, with Grace, we're thrust into an unfamiliar situation, as she's more of an active participant in the story — talking to herself throughout the demo — and I felt a stronger connection to her sense of vulnerability as a protagonist.\nOne of my favorite moments from the preview came shortly after I encountered the monster for the first time. After evading it, I went to the clinic's waystation to find a tool to open a fuse box. As I was wheeling a cart over to an elevated toolbox, the creature came into the room. As I tried hiding behind the cart, the monster spotted me and smashed the cart into me, which sent Grace hurling back to the wall. The beast then grabbed Grace and took a giant bite out of her shoulder. I used up my only health item and fled the room, returning to the well-lit safe that started the preview. Once the monster was gone, I snuck back into the waystation to retrieve the item — but more carefully this time around. It was a scary moment, but still totally exciting, and it had me on edge for the rest of the preview.\nCapcom\nMuch like Resident Evil VII and Village, Requiem is by default a first-person game, which certainly creates a palpable sense of dread and uneasiness when exploring with a limited perspective. However, Requiem also adds the option to switch to third-person, which was introduced post-launch for Resident Evil Village and its DLC, Shadows of Rose. Having played the demo from both perspectives, I was impressed with how well the presentation feels tuned for both styles. The third-person perspective captures that sense of dread and adds in the expanded visibility, which gave me a clear and distressing view of the monster stalking me from behind as I ran towards the safe room.\nIn the final stretch of my preview, I had all the tools I needed to make my exit. However, the storm outside the building blew out the lights in the area, allowing the monster to give chase. This sprint to the finish was tense and riveting. Even having seen the demo hands-off months prior, playing the sequence on my own made for a captivating experience. Once Grace made her exit, she had one last confrontation with the monster before the demo came to an abrupt end.\nCapcom\nSo far, Resident Evil Requiem feels like a souped-up version of the immersive survival horror found in recent entries of the series — and it does very well based on this preview. I appreciated just how atmospheric this one, fairly limited, area of the preview was — seeing the long stretch of the hallway, with only my lighter and a dim red light illuminating in the distance, made for a striking visual — especially with the silhouette of the monster looming in the distance.\nThat said, as well made as these sequences were, I'm already looking forward to seeing what sort of other tricks and events Requiem has in store. While I was a bit mixed on Village's Resident Evil amusement park-style structure, I'm hoping Requiem will still take some big swings with its new twist on the series' survival horror. I have plenty of questions about Resident Evil Requiem, but I'm intrigued about what's to come for this series' next big move ahead.\nResident Evil Requiem will be released on February 27, 2026 for PC, PS5, Xbox Series X|S.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/resident-evil-requiem-feels-very-familiar-but-its-so-well-made-that-i-respect-the-hell-out-of-it-180022141.html?src=rss",

We’ve gone hands-on with some of the hardware already, and we’ll have full reviews in the days ahead, so most people should hold off before making any purchases. If history is any indication, it shouldn’t be too long before we see discounts for the new phones either. But if you’re interested in taking the plunge early, we’ve quickly broken down what’s new and where you can pre-order each device below.\n \n \n \n \n This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/how-to-pre-order-googles-new-pixel-10-phones-pixel-watch-4-and-pixel-buds-2a-160046941.html?src=rss",
    "full_text": "The base Pixel 10 doesn’t look or feel all that different from last year’s Pixel 9 from afar, but it packs a few notable upgrades on the spec sheet. The big one is a new 10.8MP telephoto camera with a 5x optical zoom, which should make the phone much more adept for portraits and shots of faraway objects. We’ll have to see how noticeable these changes are in practice. The battery is also slightly larger at 4,970mAh, up from 4,700mAh. And like every other Pixel 10 phone, the device runs on a new Tensor G5 chip. Google promises improved CPU and TPU (for AI) performance there, though it’s had something of a spotty track record with custom-made silicon in the past, so we’ll have to put the chip through its paces to see how well it holds up against Qualcomm’s better Snapdragon SoCs. Elsewhere, all of the Pixel 10 phones support magnetic Qi2 charging, which here is branded “Pixelsnap.” This is essentially Google’s take on Apple’s MagSafe, and the company is selling accessories like a snap-on charging puck and ring stand alongside the handsets. The most interesting is probably “Magic Cue,” which promises to proactively surface contextually relevant information within apps. Either way, Google will still provide seven years of OS and security updates for each new phone. As for pre-order perks, Amazon and Best Buy are bundling the phone with a $100 gift card."

    "summary": "Ever since Samsung introduced the Galaxy Ring, I’ve wanted Google to make a smart ring. I initially imagined it would be a Pixel Ring — something that would fit into the existing wearable portfolio that includes the Pixel Watch and Pixel Buds. But at a recent roundtable with the heads of Google’s Health, Fitbit and Wearables businesses, I was presented a more compelling possibility. When CNN’s Lisa Eadicicco asked the question on everyone’s mind about whether Google would expand its wearable product portfolio with other types of gadgets, the answer surprised me.\nAfter first giving an expected “nothing to share as yet” response, Sandeep Waraich, the senior director of product management for Google Wearables, pointed towards the Fitbit family. “We see there’s a big opportunity with a discrete device that lasts very long [and] has a simple experience that’s very focused on health and fitness.”\nWaraich continued by saying “today, Fitbit has a pretty robust portfolio but it has not been refreshed for a while, so that’s where we see opportunity and we have been deeply thinking about bringing the right experiences.” He did not reveal much more upon further pushing, but one thing became clear to me. If Google were to make a smart ring, it would be part of the Fitbit family.\nThat makes a lot of sense, if you consider the activity trackers that Fitbit is synonymous with. They are fairly basic wristworn devices that do little more than count your steps, track your heart rate and occasionally vibrate to tell you to look at your phone. You could say they’re unsophisticated, but they’re also simple and serve very specific purposes. Plus, they last forever — clocking between days and weeks on a charge.\nAs someone who loathes wearing any device to bed, I’m frustrated at the lack of options available to me for sleep-tracking. Bed sensors don’t seem to get very accurate data, while bedside radar or motion detectors (like the Nest Hub or Amazon’s retired Halo RIse) have been largely abandoned by their makers. A smart ring, like the Galaxy Ring or Oura, are effective and comfortable solutions.\nThe thing is, a lot of my digital data is housed in Google services. I’m a Gmail girl, and I pay quite a lot every month for a generous amount of Drive storage. A Google-powered sleep tracker appeals to my data hoarder tendencies.\nThrow in the fact that Fitbit has long led the way in accurate and sophisticated sleep and activity tracking, and a Fitbit Ring’s potential grows significantly.\nOf course, there’s always the risk that, should Google make a smart ring, it might give up on the product after a few years, rendering my data or device useless. Just look at the Google graveyard. I will say that Waraich and his colleagues seem to see a future where people have multiple devices that serve various, specific purposes. A smartwatch and smart ring could both coexist as useful accessories that feed into a person’s main device, which these days is usually a smartphone. In addition to those gadgets, people likely also own laptops, TVs and tablets — screens of all sizes.\nIn response to a follow-up question on the topic of a multi-device lifestyle, Google’s general manager of Health and Home Rishi Chandra said “There’s no doubt we need to maximize the devices you already have.” But he added “there’s no doubt in my mind there’s going to be new form factors that will exist.” He cautioned, though, that “it’s too early to have conviction,” stating that currently the team is in the “experimentation phase.”\n“We are experimenting,” Chandra said. What comes out of that experimentation and what sticks around ultimately depends on developments in the industry that no one can assuredly predict. I do think, though, that given the company’s expertise in simple, straightforward activity trackers, a Fitbit Ring would not be too much of a stretch. Plus, the fact that the Oura Ring is now in its fourth generation and that it and the Galaxy Ring have proven to be worthwhile devices show that there is a market for this category.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wearables/a-fitbit-ring-would-make-so-much-sense-163055386.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Google is kicking off the fall tech event season (albeit in late summer) today with its Made by Google showcase. The headline attraction at the event is the Pixel 10 lineup, but there's plenty of other interesting stuff on offer too, such as the Pixel Watch 4, Pixel Buds 2a and — of course — a bunch of AI-related announcements.\nGoogle has also confirmed something many folks have been waiting for: its take on MagSafe. The company is calling its version Pixelsnap.\nHere's a look at everything that announced at the Made by Google event, along with links to our more in-depth coverage of each product and our hands-on impressions:\nPixel 10\n\nA tenth birthday is typically cause for a special celebration. The Pixel brand isn't quite that old yet (the original Google Pixel arrived in 2016), but there might still be enough to the base Pixel 10 to make fans don a conical hat and blow a party horn.\nFor one thing, this is the first non-Pro Pixel phone to boast a telephoto lens. It is a 5x optical zoom lens, but it supports 10x optical image quality with the help of cropping and computational photography.  Using the Super Res Zoom feature can give you a 20x zoom equivalent. Along with the telephoto lens, the Pixel 10 has 48MP wide and 13MP ultrawide sensors on the rear, as well as a 10.5MP selfie lens.\nAs with the other phones in this year's lineup, the Pixel 10 runs on the Google Tensor G5 chip. It's said to be 34 percent faster than the Tensor G4 chipset and it's the first chipset that runs the Gemini Nano model. According to Google, that supports more than 20 generative AI experiences that run locally.\nThe user interface is in line for some changes too. The company says Material 3 will support expressive photo wallpapers, customizable quick settings and improved typography. All of that should look pretty good on the Actua display, which delivers up to 3,000 nits of brightness.\nGoogle also claims that the Pixel 10's battery can power the device for more than 30 hours, up from the 24-plus hours for which the Pixel 9 lineup was rated. When you use a 30W adapter, you'll be able to charge the Pixel 10 to 55 percent of its capacity (i.e. 16-plus hours of use) in 30 minutes. In addition, the handset boasts a satin metal finish, Gorilla Glass Victus 2 and an IP68 rating for dust and water resistance.\nThe Pixel 10 will shelves on August 28. It starts at $799 and will be available in Obsidian, Frost, Lemongrass and Indigo colorways.\nRead more about the Pixel 10.\nPixel 10 Pro / Pro 10 XL\nSam Rutherford for Engadget\nHow would you like that thing we just told you about but with higher specs and maybe a larger display? The Pixel 10 Pro and Pixel 10 Pro XL each boast a 50MP wide lens, a 48MP ultrawide and a 48MP 5x telephoto lens. Google claims this is its best camera system in a smartphone to date. There's more memory in these models too, with 16GB of RAM versus 12GB in the base Pixel 10. (The Pixel 10 Pro Fold has 16GB of RAM too.)\nThe Super Actua displays are about 10 percent brighter than on the Pixel 9 Pro series, with 2,200 nits of full-screen brightness or 3,300 peak when viewing HDR content, and that's while consuming less power than previous models. The Pixel 10 Pro has a 6.3-inch screen while the Pixel 10 Pro XL has a 6.8-inch display, and each has a variable refresh rate of up to 120Hz.\nAs with the base Pixel 10, the Pro models are slated to have more than 30 hours of battery life on a single charge. The Pixel 10 Pro supports 30W fast charging, while you can top up a Pixel 10 Pro XL with 45W of fast charging. Both support Qi2, but in what's said to be a first for a phone, the 10 Pro XL offers 25W wireless charging via Qi2.2 compatibility. The Pixel 10 Pro XL has upgraded speakers too, with what Google claims is loud and powerful bass, along with full and balanced stereo audio.\nThe Pixel 10 Pro and 10 Pro XL will be available in Moonstone, Jade, Porcelain and Obsidian colorways on August 28, with pre-orders opening up today. The Pixel 10 Pro starts at $999 for 128GB of storage and the Pixel 10 Pro XL will run you $1,199 for 256GB of storage.\nRead more about the Pixel 10 Pro and Pixel 10 Pro XL. \nPixel 10 Pro Fold\nSam Rutherford for Engadget\nOf course, there's a fourth phone in the Pixel 10 lineup this fall. Google made durability a priority on the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, which has an IP68 rating for dust and water resistance (a first for a foldable, the company says). A new gearless hinge will help with that — Google says it's twice as durable as the hinge in the Pixel 9 Pro Fold. In fact, the company claims the Pixel 10 Pro Fold is designed to handle over 10 years of folding.\nThe internal, eight-inch Super Actua Reflex display (said to be the largest on any phone), and outer 6.4-inch Actua display both deliver up to 3,000 nits of brightness. Google says it redesigned the interior with resilient, ultra-thin glass, along with dual anti-impact layers to help protect it from drops.\nThe Pixel 10 Pro Fold is said to have the largest battery in a foldable yet, with a 5,015mAh capacity. As with the rest of the Pixel 10 lineup, there's Qi2 wireless charging support — an apparent first for a foldable. Alternatively, you'll be able to charge the battery to half of its capacity in 30 minutes with a 30W adapter, Google says.\nThe triple-camera array includes a new 48MP main sensor, along with a 10.5MP ultrawide lens with macro focus and a 10.8MP telephoto lens. A feature called Instant View will show recently-taken pictures alongside the viewfinder. Google says it improved multitasking as well, with split-screen functionality that supports app resizing and the option to drag and drop files.\nThe Pixel 10 Pro Fold comes in Moonstone and Jade colorways, but it'll arrive later than the rest of the Pixel 10 family — it's scheduled to land on October 9. It starts at $1,799 for 256GB of storage. If you're willing to splash out more cash, though, you can have up to 1TB of onboard storage, the first time that's been an option in a Pixel Pro Fold.\nRead more about the Pixel 10 Pro Fold.\nPixelsnap\nSam Rutherford for Engadget\nAs mentioned above, all of the Pixel 10 devices have Qi2 wireless charging capabilities built-in, but Google is expanding on that with its own, long-awaited spin on MagSafe. Google's take is called Pixelsnap. The company is offering a slew of magnetic accessories for Pixel 10 devices, including cases, a charging puck, charging stand and non-charging ring stand.\nRead more about Pixelsnap.\nAI updates\nSam Rutherford for Engadget\nThis being Google in the Gregorian calendar year of 2025, of course there are a bunch of AI features coming to the Pixel 10 lineup (some should trickle down to older models later). Magic Cue might be the handiest of the latest tools. This is said to deliver proactive suggestions based on your activity by pulling data from the likes of Gmail and Google Calendar.\nFor instance, if you're calling your airline, Magic Cue might pull up your flight details. If a friend asks for the address of your Airbnb vacation rental, Magic Cue could bring that up to save you some time.\nThere are plenty of other AI tools on the way to Pixel 10 devices. I am an abysmal photographer, so Camera Coach sounds like it could be a genuinely useful feature for people like me. When you point the cameras at a subject or scene you want to capture, Gemini kicks into gear to analyze what the lenses are picking up. The feature will offer composition and framing suggestions, and suggest camera modes to employ. Gemini Live can offer visual guidance with on-screen overlays. \nMeanwhile, the Guided Frame feature will describe what the camera sees, primarily to assist blind and low-vision users. This is said to work on any scene and seems (at least on the surface) similar to services like Be My Eyes.\nSam Rutherford for Engadget\nOther Pixel 10 AI camera tools include Auto Best Take, which can seemingly pick out the best group photo from multiple options. As for adjusting images, the Conversational Editing feature harnesses Gemini to help you tweak things using natural language voice prompts. You might ask it to adjust lighting, change the framing of a shot or remove objects, and hopefully Gemini will be able to handle those without a hitch. \nIn addition, Pixel 10 devices are the first phones to implement C2PA (Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity) content credentials directly in the camera app. This is an industry standard labeling system for content that's created or modified using generative AI.\nElsewhere, Pixel translation tools could be in line for a serious upgrade with Voice Translate. Google says this feature will be able to translate calls in real-time in your own voice.\nGoogle has folded a new native audio model into Gemini Live that's said to control the emotional tone and be capable of detecting a user's emotions. AI could help you better manage your calls too. The Call Message function will keep missed and declined calls separate from spam, and offer real-time transcripts as well as suggestions for next steps. Gboard writing tools, Pixel Studio and NotebookLM integration are in line for updates too.\nSam Rutherford for Engadget\nLast but not least, Pixel 10 devices have a Pixel Journal app that will remain private (following in Apple's footsteps to a degree). The app harnesses AI to offer prompts that may help you track your progress and record your thoughts. \nRead more about the Pixel 10 AI features.\nPixel Watch 4\nSam Rutherford for Engadget\nLet's move on from phones and take a gander at Google's latest smartwatch. The Pixel Watch 4 has a new dome-style display that's 10 percent larger than the screen on the Pixel Watch 3. It can reach up to 3,000 nits of brightness. Battery life is said to be improved too, with Google claiming it can power the wearable for up to 40 hours on a single charge. Google has also made it easier to replace the screen and battery this time around too, though we'll have to see it in person before we can judge how easy it is to actually do.\nOther features include satellite connectivity for emergencies (when you're out of range of Wi-Fi and cell towers), an electrocardiogram app and irregular heart rhythm notifications. Google says the Pixel Watch 4 will be able to detect when a wearer's heart stops beating and contact emergency services. There will also be an AI-based personal fitness coach. Fitbit Premium subscribers will be the first to gain access to that.\nThe Pixel Watch 4 will be available in in two sizes, 41mm and 45mm. It starts at $349 and will hit shelves on October 9.\nRead more about the Pixel Watch 4 and AI personal fitness coach.\nPixel Buds 2a and Pixel Buds Pro 2 updates\nSam Rutherford for Engadget\nGoogle hasn't forgotten about its earbuds here either. The company is releasing the the Pixel Buds 2a with active noise cancellation (ANC), powered by a Tensor A1 chip. Even with this upgrade, these are Google's lightest and smallest A-Series earbuds to date.\nThey're IP54 rated for dust and water resistance, while the charging case has an IPX4 rating. The Tensor A1 chip is also said to deliver improved quality for calls and other audio, while supporting Gemini and other AI features in the Pixel Buds 2a. These earbuds are said to have double the battery life of their predecessors at 10 hours on a single charge, with the case adding 17 hours of listening time (seven and 13 hours, respectively, when ANC is enabled). \nThe Pixel Buds 2a will be available on October 9 in Hazel and Iris colorways. However, due to these upgrades, the Pixel Buds 2a will cost $130, which is $31 more than the previous generation.\nMeanwhile, Google is offering the Pixel Buds Pro 2 in a new colorway, Moonstone, to match some of the Pixel 10 devices. A software update in September will introduce more features to the Pixel Buds Pro 2, including protection from certain sudden loud noises, the ability to adjust audio based on the volume of your surroundings, a way to answer or dismiss calls with head gestures and advanced audio processing for Gemini Live.\nRead more about the Pixel Buds 2a and Pixel Buds Pro 2 updates.\nHands-on with the Pixel 10 lineup and Pixel Watch 4\nSam Rutherford for Engadget\nAhead of the Made by Google event, we had a chance to go hands-on with the new devices. You can now check out our first impressions of:\n\nGoogle Pixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro and Pixel 10 Pro XL\nPixel 10 Pro Fold\nPixel Watch 4\n\nIf you're interested in pre-ordering any of those — or the Pixel Buds 2a — we've got you covered with our pre-order guide.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/everything-announced-at-the-made-by-google-pixel-event-including-the-pixel-10-lineup-161155567.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Software has always been an integral part of the Pixel experience, and that's not changing with the new Pixel 10 family. At its Made by Google event today in New York, Google detailed a suite of new machine learning and AI features that will debut with the Pixel 10 series before making their way to earlier models.   \nThe first new tool most people are likely to encounter is Magic Cue. As you're texting your friends, Gemini Nano, Google's private on-device model, will populate the conversation with contextual suggestions. For example, if a friend asks about a dinner reservation you two made last week, the Pixel 10 will display a shortcut you can tap to send them a Google Maps listing. Magic Cue depends on there being a digital paper trail to work. You can long press the shortcuts it generates to see where Gemini sourced the information it's relaying to you. In the case of the example above, it may have come from your personal Gmail. \nSam Rutherford for Engadget\nThe feature has extensions throughout Android. For instance, if a family member texts you about a flight you two are about to take, Magic Cue will not only provide the number of the airline, it will also display information about your flight on screen for easy reference.     \nOn the Discover page, which you can access on nearly every Android device by swiping to the leftmost page of your phone's home screen, there's a new shortcut to a feature called the Daily Hub. Like Samsung's Now Brief, it's a page with an AI-generated summary of the upcoming day. At the top, you'll see a greeting, with a weather forecast and and any upcoming events on your calendar. Below that, there will be a list of reminders pulled from Gmail, Keep and other Google apps. If you keep scrolling, you'll also find recommended articles and videos from YouTube.  \nSam Rutherford for Engadget\nFor those who also want to reflect at the end of their day, there's a new Journal app too. It has AI features built throughout. For instance, as you're writing an entry, it will automatically suggest images to include from your photo library. Additionally, the app will attempt to automatically categorize your entries based on topics you've designated. Google has used emoji for this part of the interface, which make it easy to see at a glance what you wrote about from the app's monthly view.       \nOver in Photos, Google has introduced a feature called Conversational Editing. It allows you to tweak an image by describing to your phone how you want it modified. For example, say you took a selfie of yourself in a busy tourist location. You can tell Photos — using your voice, your phone's on-screen keyboard or a suggested prompt — to edit all the strangers out of the scene. After a few moments, the on-device model will produce a new image, with the original displayed alongside it so you can compare the two. It's possible to build multiple edits on top of one another, and if you don't like the latest edit, you can go back. \nSam Rutherford for Engadget\nIn the camera app, there are a handful of new AI features. First, there's Camera Coach, which will examine the shot you're about to snap. It will read the scene and make suggestions on the angle and lighting to use, as well what capture mode is best for the situation. Another new AI feature, dubbed Auto Best Take, finds and combines similar photos so that everyone in a group shot looks their best. Lastly, Google updated last year's Add Me feature to make it easier to include the photographer in even larger groups.  \nElsewhere, Google is introducing a few upgrades to its Gemini Live visual assistant that build on the base the company debuted last year. To start, there are new visual indicators that will mask part of your phone's screen to make it easier to see what Gemini is referring to when it answers a question. This feature will be available first on Pixel 10 devices before rolling out to other Android phones and iOS devices later. Separately, Google says it will soon release a new model that \"dramatically\" improves how Gemini uses key elements of human speech. For instance, you'll be able to tell the assistant to speak slowly if you're jotting down notes, and it will change its tone depending on the emotional nature of the topic you're discussing.   \nThe Pixel 10 family is available to per-order today, with general availability of the Pixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro and Pixel 10 Pro XL to follow on August 28. The Pixel 10 Pro Fold, Pixel Watch 4 and Pixel Buds 2a won't arrive at retail until October 9. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/all-the-new-ai-features-coming-to-the-pixel-10-phones-160017270.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "After the usual months of rumors and anticipation, Google has officially launched the new Pixel 10 Pro and 10 Pro XL at its Made by Google event. The new generation flagship devices carry packed spec sheets with impressive upgrades from the Pixel 9 Pro. Perhaps the most exciting among them is the addition of Pixelsnap, which supports Google's new ecosystem of Qi2-compatible chargers that magnetically align to the back of the phone. Beyond just the convenience, Qi2 compatibility should offer faster wireless charging speeds, too. This functionality had been conspicuously missing from flagship Android devices until now, and spawns a whole new world of accessories that can snap onto the back of the Pixel.\nGoogle's flagship phones have long been known for delivering excellent photos, and these new Pixel's continue that tradition. Both models carry a triple rear camera system with a 50MP wide lens, a 48MP ultrawide with macro, and an “upgraded” 48MP 5x telephoto lens. It’s not clear yet what’s new about that telephoto camera, as it has the same f/2.8 aperture and 22-degree field of view as the one on the Pixel 9 Pro series. ProRes support is standard for more serious photo editors. \nThe 6.3-inch Pixel 10 Pro and the 6.8-inch Pixel 10 Pro XL will both feature a Super Actua display with variable refresh rate up to 120 Hz. The displays offer up to 3,300 nits of peak brightness or 2,200 nits peak in HDR, about ten percent brighter than on the Pixel 9 Pro series.\nBoth models boast their largest batteries yet with over 30 hours of battery life, which represents a roughly 25 percent boost over the last generation. The Pixel 10 Pro supports 30W fast charging while the Pro XL supports 45W. While both phones support the Qi2 standard, the 10 Pro XL is the first phone to support Qi2.2 with 25W wireless charging. The standard 10 Pro is limited to 15W wireless charging. Both sizes will be sold with 16GB of RAM. \nThe Pro and Pro XL will both sport the Google Tensor G5 chip, which powers new on-board AI features coming to the entire Pixel 10 lineup. Key among them is Magic Cue, which can provide relevant information to the user by understanding when it's needed, like pulling up your flight info when you're calling the airline. Camera Coach is another AI-powered feature that will help users take better photographs by helping them find the best angle or lighting.\nBoth sizes will be available in four color choices, those being Moonstone, Jade, Porcelain and Obsidian. The Pixel 10 Pro will launch at $999 for the 128GB model, and the Pixel 10 Pro XL will launch at $1,199 with 256GB of storage (double what the Pixel 9 Pro XL included). The new Pixel Pro line is available for pre-orders today and will hit shelves on August 28.\n \n \nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/the-pixel-10-pro-series-features-brighter-displays-bigger-batteries-and-qi2-wireless-charging-160059520.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Google just announced the Pixel 10 Pro Fold smartphone at the Made by Google event. This latest foldable offers some novel features, especially when compared to rival handsets like the recently-released Galaxy Z Fold 7.\nThe Pixel 10 Pro Fold offers an IP68 rating for dust and water resistance. This is pretty significant for dust, as the Z Fold 7 has just an IP48 rating. IP68 is a good rating and essentially means that the unit will be completely dustproof and can withstand being submerged in water deeper than one meter for around 30 minutes. The Pixel 9 Pro Fold offered an IPX8 rating, which is the same metric for water but a much poorer rating for dust. \nThe Pixel 10 Pro Fold also includes Qi2 wireless charging, and it's the first foldable to offer this feature. That'll pair nicely with Google's just-announced PixelSnap platform, which is the company's answer to Apple's MagSafe.\n\n\n\n\n   Google \n \n\nThe general specs are solid here. It ships with a 6.4-inch external OLED display and an 8-inch internal display when unfolded. The hinge is made from high-grade aluminum alloy and the external display features a Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 cover.\nThe battery lasts for around 24 hours, but Google's Extreme Battery Saver software can extend that all the way up to 84 hours.

    "full_text": "This latest foldable offers some novel features, especially when compared to rival handsets like the recently-released Galaxy Z Fold 7. The Pixel 10 Pro Fold offers an IP68 rating for dust and water resistance. This is pretty significant for dust, as the Z Fold 7 has just an IP48 rating. IP68 is a good rating and essentially means that the unit will be completely dustproof and can withstand being submerged in water deeper than one meter for around 30 minutes. The Pixel 9 Pro Fold offered an IPX8 rating, which is the same metric for water but a much poorer rating for dust. The battery lasts for around 24 hours, but Google's Extreme Battery Saver software can extend that all the way up to 84 hours. It can also charge up to 50 percent in just 30 minutes. It ships with a Google Tensor G5 chip, 16GB of RAM and up to 1TB in storage. Like most foldables, this handset is on the expensive side.

    "summary": "Alongside the Pixel Watch 4 (and family of Pixel 10 devices), Google also introduced a new “personal health coach” today at its Made By Google event. A preview of it will begin rolling out in October as part of the Fitbit app to Premium users in the US. The app is also getting a redesign which the company says will be “available with the latest Fitbit trackers, Fitbit smart watches and Pixel watches.”\nThe first thing Fitbit users may notice is a visual refresh. In place of the current organization system, the bottom of the screen will feature four tabs: Today, Fitness, Sleep and Health. The home page (Today) will still feature daily progress stats in the form of bars and rings at the top, though these are now customizable so you can display your favorite metrics there. \nBelow this is a feed of your upcoming workouts, recent activity and progress reports served in individual cards that you can tap into for more information. This layout, with data visualizations at the top and a feed that follows, is the same across all four tabs.  \nGoogle\nAt a recent demo, the company’s director of product management for Fitbit and health Andy Abramson showed us how his app surfaced his weekly cardio load in a ring, with bars to its right for his steps, readiness and sleep performance. “We call these our focus metrics,” he said. These are in a color scheme that will be familiar to Fitbit users, with purple continuing to be the color representing sleep data and teal for steps. But there’s a few more updates that Google says “address common user suggestions,” and these include easier layouts, more intuitive data visualization, “improved syncing — and of course, dark mode.”\nGoogle didn’t just give the Fitbit app a makeover. It said that coaching and AI were at the core of the redesign, and that the “entire app was rebuilt so the health coach can understand your goals, build your plan, contextualize your metrics and bring insights at the right moments.”\nAbramson said that his team sought to figure out “How do we put the AI coach in every part of the app?” Instead of simply tucking the AI features into a dedicated tab, “We actually need to tie it together.”\nTo that end, a floating “Ask Coach” button is on every page of the app at the bottom right, and tapping it will take you into a conversation window with the Gemini-powered AI. This button is accessible across all the tabs in the updated app, and you can ask it questions about all the data you’ve provided to Fitbit.\nOn your first time using the new app, you’ll be prompted to have a conversation with the AI coach, where it will ask about your goals, available equipment and any preferences, injuries or other relevant medical history. Those will go into an area called “Coach Notes,” that you can access in the Health tab and see what the app knows about you. There, you can delete things you don’t want in there any more.\nCherlynn Low for Engadget\nIf you only have a few free weights and a rowing machine, for example, the coach can build a custom plan that suggests a variety of weights-based exercises interspersed with sessions on your rower. But if you tell it at any point that you might be looking to incorporate outdoor runs into your routine, it can do so. Abramson told the app he wanted to get better at trail runs, for example, and in the version of the app I saw, that guidance affected a lot of the recommendations he was served. As he had told it he was traveling and had access to a hotel gym, it also suggested some activities on the facility’s Peloton bike.\nIn future versions of the AI coach, you might be able to integrate with Gemini Live and point your camera around your (or your hotel’s) gym to get the system to identify what equipment is available and generate suggestions based on that. For now, all input to the app is limited to text, which means you may still need to know the difference between a barbell, a Y-bell and a dumbbell.\nThe coach will build programs based on the info you supply, and these will come with detailed instructions and “metric targets that focus on weekly progression.” If you’re familiar with the cardio load and readiness score features that Google and Fitbit have rolled out in recent years, it’s easy to see how the concept has been developing over time. Your activity progress should not be judged on a daily basis — too many variables could affect whether you were able to get in a run or 10,000 steps on any given day.\nInstead, a more forgiving and holistic approach would be to consider weekly movement. If, like me, you tend to get in two cardio days, two strength days and one HIIT day a week, you won’t be penalized for not getting cardio in on a weights day. Or say you put in too many hours at work one day, writing a long article late into the night. The AI coach will recognize that you didn’t get as much sleep as usual and adjust your target cardio load accordingly. Google said the coach will make “real-time check-ins and adjustments” and that if you let the system know you’ve hurt your back, it will give you tips on how to modify your workouts.\nGoogle\nPart of the update to the Fitbit app includes new sleep algorithms that Google says make it more accurate, providing “a more precise understanding of your sleep duration and stages.” The coach also guides you to get better sleep, by studying your patterns over the week and sharing insights on how to improve things over time. If it notices that on weekdays you take a longer time than usual to fall asleep, for example, it might recommend heading to bed or turning off your devices earlier. If it thinks you might be jetlagged, it could suggest sleep schedules to help you re-adjust to new timezones. Finally, the sleep coach might look at your energy expenditure each day and recommend a bedtime that could get you 30 minutes of extra rest to get over a particularly grueling workout you undertook that morning.\nIn time, the Fitbit coach will get data from a variety of sources, as it will support Health Connect and HealthKit to get things like your glucose levels or your weight and body composition from your smart scale or other connected devices.\nGoogle also says that in addition to helping you get personalized insights based on your activity and rest, its AI coach can help make sense of an overwhelming amount of data noise. That’s not just the information overload from all the different metrics your wearable might collect, but also the fact that there is a ton of content out there today that Google says is “written for everyone in general and no one in particular.”\nSince it has access to a wealth of data about you and a gigantic knowledge base from the internet, the coach can filter out noise to give you pertinent answers to your questions. You can ask things like “I’m feeling stressed right now. What can I do?” or “What are the best exercises for weight loss” and, according to Google, “get truly personalized answers that are backed by science.” The system will also serve up timely and regular reports on your performance and any trends or changes.\nUsing AI to make sense of the overwhelming amount of data collected by our wearables seems like a smart approach, but it’s not without its drawbacks or concerns. Will your sensitive information be safely guarded? What type of information will the AI Coach serve and how trustworthy is that guidance?\nGoogle\nGoogle appears to be attempting to get ahead of those concerns, saying it is “committed to building our personal health coach with leading industry experts and through scientific research.” It’s partnered with Stephen Curry “and his performance team,” and is “working closely with our Consumer Health Advisory Panel, a diverse group of leading experts in medicine, AI and behavioral science.”\nI think it’s imperative that Google state very clearly that its AI Coach can not replace a doctor, a registered dietitian or a certified coach, and that it has guardrails in place to prevent aggressively pushing a person towards dangerous outcomes. The good news is, Google is well aware that it will have work to do, and is clear that it is “releasing this experience as a preview so you can help shape it as we make regular improvements.”\nFor now, the AI is designed to help with fitness and sleep insights and recommendations, though it’s worth noting that Fitbit has historically considered a broader range of areas including mental health and menstrual cycles as essential components of overall wellbeing. In future, the AI Coach may also cover those types of data.\nIf you’re keen to test the redesigned Fitbit app and new personal health coach out, you’ll have to be a Fitbit Premium subscriber, be based in the US and sign up to get notified when the preview is available in October.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/a-closer-look-at-googles-ai-health-coach-and-the-redesigned-fitbit-app-160041881.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "The Pixel 10 marks the 10th generation of Google's homegrown smartphone efforts. This year, alongside a new Tensor G5 chip, the company has included some upgrades that might make the base model the star of the family.\nThe standard Pixel 10: Now with a dedicated zoom for the first time\nAside from updated color options (obsidian, indigo, frost and lemongrass), the standard Pixel 10 doesn't look too much different from last year's phone. It still has a matte aluminum frame and a 6.3-inch OLED screen with a 120Hz refresh rate. For 2025, Google has upped the brightness of its Actua display to a peak of 3,000 nits (up from 2,700 nits). Google also claims the Pixel 10's speakers have been significantly improved, though it was hard to tell by how much during my demo. \n\n\nInside, changes to the Pixel 10's specs are a bit more robust. The Tensor G5 features a CPU that's 34 percent better year-over-year on top of a new TPU that's 60 percent faster than before. Memory and storage are staying the same at 12GB of RAM and either 128GB or 256GB of storage, though it's important to note that battery capacity has increased to 4,970mAh (up from 4,700mAh). That latter figure is even more than what you get from the Pixel 10 Pro (4,870mAh).\nBut by far, the biggest upgrade on the standard Pixel 10 is a new 10.8MP camera with a 5x optical zoom, joining the existing 48MP main and 13MP ultrawide cams. This is the first time Google has ever put a dedicated zoom lens on a base Pixel, which is a huge value add because previously anyone who wanted a telephoto camera had to pay extra for one of the premium models. And based on what I saw in person and its specs, its telephoto camera appears to be similar to what we got in last year's Pixel 9 Pro Fold, so even if it's not quite as powerful as what's available on the Pixel 10 Pros, it's still a great addition to the base model. \nFurthermore, when compared to the standard Galaxy S25, the Pixel 10 suddenly has a significant hardware advantage thanks to a bigger battery (just 4,000 mAh on the Samsung), a longer zoom (5x vs 3x) and slightly faster wired charging (up to 30 watts on the Pixel instead of just 25W). Plus, both phones come with the same seven years of Android updates and security patches.\n\n\n\n\n  Sam Rutherford for Engadget\n \n\nThat said, it remains to be seen if the Tensor G5 can match the general overall performance of the Snapdragon 8 Elite chips used in Samsung phones. That has always been a shortcoming of Google's homegrown silicon. But for pretty much everything else, the base Pixel 10 is looking like a much more complete device and a great option for anyone looking to save some money, since its price is staying the same at $799.\nPixel 10 Pro and Pro XL: Even better specs and some Pro-only camera tricks\nAs for the $999 Pixel 10 Pro and $1,199 Pro XL, like their smaller sibling, their appearance hasn't changed too much. The easiest way to tell them apart from the base model is that the Pros have a shiny frame instead of matte and slightly different colors: obsidian, moonstone, porcelain and jade. Their 6.3- and 6.8-inch Super Actua displays have gotten a similar bump in brightness up to 3,300 nits (up from 3,000 nits), while memory and storage have received a boost as well, up to 16GB of RAM and as much as 1TB of storage. Unfortunately, even though the Pixel 10 Pro XL now supports wired charging at up to 45 watts, the 10 Pro remains capped at 30.\n\n\n\n\n  Sam Rutherford for Engadget\n \n\nOf course, with the base Pixel 10 getting a new zoom lens, Google couldn't forget about the Pro models. The Pixel 10 Pro and Pro XL's cameras have the same resolution as before: a 50MP main, 48MP ultra-wide and a 48MP telephoto with 5x optical zoom. However, Google has made some tweaks that include a new ISP, an improved optical image stabilization system and some additional tools like the ability to shoot portrait mode shots in full resolution, a first for the Pixel family.\nHowever, my favorite new feature here is Pro Res Zoom, an upgraded version of Super Res Zoom that can capture long-distance shots at up to 100x while using machine learning to fill in the gaps. Google says its algorithm pays special attention to things like people's faces, so hopefully we don't run into any AI slop. From what I've seen, Pro Res Zoom works remarkably well, especially when you consider that everything is happening on-device instead of sending images to the cloud for additional processing. Seeing this kind of sharpness at up to 100x from a 5x optical zoom is damn impressive, even if the Pixel is getting an assist from AI.\nNew software, camera and AI features\n\n\n\n\n  Sam Rutherford for Engadget\n \n\nNaturally, this wouldn't be a Pixel launch without a bunch of new software and AI-powered tricks. Sadly, there are so many new tools that I didn't have a chance to do a deep dive into all of them. The feature with the most potential might be Magic Cue, which uses AI to surface helpful information like addresses, reservations and more directly inside some of your most commonly used apps like Google Messages and Gmail. These prompts appear as little rainbow bubbles and you can tap on them to quickly send relevant info to others. When dealing with a flight, Magic Cue can call the related airline for you.\nMeanwhile, Google's Daily Hub functions a lot like Samsung's Now Brief feature, which puts handy reminders, calendar appointments and more all in a single place. This gives you a quick overview of important things happening each day. Alternatively, if you want to be a bit more introspective, the Pixel Journal feature is essentially a digital diary that's meant to help you reflect on important events or surface new topics that may be relevant to your interests.\nElsewhere, there's a new on-the-fly translation feature that can mimic the sound of your own voice during calls. Gemini Live is also getting a visual overlay so it can better highlight things on your screen and clearly point out what it sees. And then there's Take a Message, which is kind of like Call Screener but for missed calls.\nFor photography, Google showed off the ability to use natural language voice commands to edit images or add completely new elements to a pic (like putting sunglasses on an alpaca). Best Take has also been improved to analyze up to 150 frames before you even hit the shutter in group shots, allowing the phone to pick out an image where everyone is smiling. But if that doesn't happen, it can use AI to create a composite photo with the best expressions across a series of shots. \nAlso, across the Pixel 10 line, Google is supporting the C2PA standard, so that there will be no guessing which images have been made or tweaked with AI and which ones are all natural (at least for things created in first-party apps). And finally, launching as a preview later this fall, there's a new Camera Coach tool that uses AI to help you frame your shots, improve your composition or even suggest some new angles and ideas (Google calls it Get Inspired). The feature offers step-by-step instructions on how to recreate a specific shot.\nPixelsnap: Finally, official Qi2 support from a major Android phone maker\n\n\n\n\n  Sam Rutherford for Engadget\n \n\nThe last major upgrade is the addition of proper Qi2 wireless charging support. Google is calling this Pixelsnap, but it's based on the same underlying spec used in iPhones and other Qi2-compatible devices and it will be available on the entire Pixel 10 family. The one quirk is that while the Pixel 10 Pro XL can wirelessly charge at up to 25 watts, the base Pixel 10 and Pixel 10 Pro are still limited to just 15 watts. On top of that, Google will have a handful of Pixelsnap accessories, including a charging mount with a removable Pixelsnap puck, a magnetic ring stand and more.\nRegardless, after major Android phone makers failed to add Qi2 support to last year's flagships, I'm glad Google is finally coming around, even if it took longer than I'd like. Not only does this open up the Pixel 10 line to the wide world of magnetic accessories, with a big name like Google hopping on the trend, it puts more pressure on companies like Samsung to properly adopt the standard instead of its devices being merely \"Qi2 ready\" (aka, Qi2 but without a built-in magnetic mounting point).\nEarly thoughts\n\n\n\n\n  Sam Rutherford for Engadget\n \n\nAll told, I really like what Google is doing with the Pixel 10 line. The addition of a proper zoom camera on the base model is a blessing for people who might not want to pay the $200 premium for the Pro versions. It’s also great because I think the matte finish on the standard Pixel 10 looks better than the polished frame on the Pixel 10 Pro. And that goes double for the indigo variant, which is a callback to the original deep blue hue we saw back on the first Pixel from 2016.\nAs a fan of long-distance photography, I really like the addition of Pro Res Zoom, though I do want to test it some more to see the limits of Google's AI magnification. It kind of bugs me that the Pixel 10 Pro XL has faster wired and wireless charging, as those specs really ought to be the same across both Pro models. And while the Tensor G5 seems to be much speedier than any of Google's previous chips, I'm very curious as to how much better it'll feel in the real world, particularly for stuff like gaming. But as a whole, the Pixel 10 family is shaping up to be some of the most well-rounded smartphones Google has ever made.\nThe Pixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro and Pixel 10 Pro XL are available for pre-order today starting at $799, $999 and $1,199 with official sales beginning on August 27.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/google-pixel-10-series-hands-on-the-base-model-takes-center-stage-160040470.html?src=rss",
