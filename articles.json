    "summary": "NVIDIA has reportedly asked its suppliers to halt production related to its H20 AI chips for the Chinese market. According to The Information, the company told Arizona-based Amkor Technology and Samsung Electronics to put a pause on their work for the H20. Amkor produces advanced packaging for the H20 chips, while Samsung supplies memory for NVIDIA. Reuters has also reported that NVIDIA asked Foxconn, which is in charge of backend processing for the chip, to suspend its work. \"We constantly manage our supply chain to address market condition,\" the company told CNBC in a statement when asked to comment about the supposed production pause. \nThe US government had blocked NVIDIA from selling the H20 in China back in April, out of concerns that the country could use it to develop AI tech for its military. It allowed the company to resume selling the chip in China by July, reportedly after closing a deal that would give it 15 percent of the sales. But China didn't welcome the H20 with open arms. Local regulators instructed the biggest Chinese tech companies, including ByteDance and Alibaba to stop new orders for H20 chips, citing security concerns. The Cyberspace Administration of China talked to NVIDIA, claiming that AI experts had revealed that the chips could be tracked and controlled remotely. NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang had admitted that Chinese regulators asked him about the supposed \"backdoor\" and said that he made it clear it didn't exist. \"Hopefully the response that we've given to the Chinese government will be sufficient,\" Huang said. \nA recent report by the Financial Times, however, claimed that Chinese authorities didn't issue warnings against using NVIDIA chips just because of security concerns. Apparently, they found certain remarks by US commerce secretary Howard Lutnick \"insulting.\" When the US allowed shipments of the H20 to China again, Lutnick said during an interview: \"We don't sell them our best stuff, not our second best stuff, not even our third best. The fourth one down, we want to keep China using it...  You want to sell the Chinese enough that their developers get addicted to the American technology stack.\"\nThe H20 is currently the most advanced AI chip NVIDIA can sell in the Chinese market, but the company is reportedly developing a more powerful product. It will be based on the company's Blackwell architecture, Reuters previously reported, and will be capable of half the computing power of NVIDIA's Blackwell Ultra GPUs.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/nvidia-reportedly-stops-production-of-h20-ai-chips-133020132.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "The Made By Google event was not only a showcase of Google’s latest Pixel hardware, but a launchpad for many new AI features. I’m typically skeptical of the current generation of AI, but as I checked out the new software across various demo sessions, I found myself more and more intrigued. It seems like Google, along with Apple and Samsung, has been working on making these AI-powered updates more helpful in a way that might actually make our lives easier or simply more fun.\nThere wasn’t enough time to write up every single one of them, so I’ve put a few of my favorites in this story to give you a better sense of what to expect when the Pixel 10 series hits retail shelves later this month. Spoiler alert: Many of these have to do with voice and calls — an area Google has historically excelled at.\nThe Recorder app can generate backing music\nI have long been enamored with Google’s Recorder app. It started with the on-device transcription that made getting quotes from my interviews easy and relatively secure. But when Apple introduced a multi-track recording function to its Voice Memos app, I quickly jumped ship. While the iOS recorder has inferior transcription in terms of accuracy and readability, the fact that I could basically record a duet with myself seriously appealed to the musical theater geek in me. I played both Elphaba and Glinda, crooning their parts from “For Good” into my iPhone.\nBut when Google’s senior director of product management for Pixel software Shenaz Zack told me the Pixel 10’s recorder app would add AI-generated music to your singing, I went silent in slight disbelief. I spent much of my youth ripping karaoke tracks from YouTube videos, looking up “minus one” or “backing tracks” or “instrumentals only” on various download platforms. My friends and I were aspiring performers, looking to mix our own covers of popular songs, and a tool that would generate backing music to our voice tracks would have been a dream come true. Honestly it kind of still is.\nZack walked me through the process twice — on my first try I sang a verse and part of the chorus of “Golden” from the Kpop Demon Hunters soundtrack. I giggled self-consciously at the end, before Zack hit stop. As it recorded, the app actually showed a tag that indicated it knew I was singing, and when we selected the recording after, a chip appeared saying “Create and add music.”\nTapping that brought up a panel titled “Choose a vibe to create music” with two sections: Featured vibes and Your vibes. Under the first one, the options were “Chill beats,” “Cozy,” “Dance party,” “Rainy day blues,” “Romantic” and “Surprise me.” On my second attempt, when I rushed through a rendition of the all-time banger “Mary Had a Little Lamb,” the app displayed a warning at the bottom that said “The beat might not match well if the recording is short.”\nI chose Dance Party, hit next, and waited a minute or so while Recorder went to work. The animation at the top said the system was analyzing the audio, identifying the rhythm, locking onto the beat and harmonizing the track before delivering the result.\nI don’t quite know what I was expecting, but I can say that those who were at all concerned about digital rights management have nothing to worry about. The music that Google generated for “Golden” sounded nothing like the original, and while it did make my voice sound less lonely and made for a more complete track, I felt like I needed a few more adjustments to feel satisfied with it. As for “Mary Had a Little Lamb,” the result was as generic as expected for an AI-generated soundtrack to a very basic nursery rhyme.\nTo Google’s credit, what came out seemed to be in the right key and rhythm, and I certainly will need much more time playing around with this to see if tweaking the settings will help. I also wanted to point out that the generated music also stopped as my singing stopped, so the giggling I mentioned earlier was not scored.\nAlthough this feature did not live up to my (admittedly unrealistic) fantasy, I do think it’s a fun use of AI and seems harmless. It’s not going to be a mainstay of most people’s daily routines, although Zack did say that a large percent of people actually used Recorder for singing. This update could certainly make for a nice little dose of musical creativity.\n        View this post on Instagram            A post shared by Engadget (@engadget)\n\nVoice Translate made it sound like I was speaking German\nI had more concerns around the Voice Translate feature that was supposed to make you or your caller sound like you were speaking in a different language. According to Google, the goal is to “break down language barriers during phone calls.” When I asked Zack why the company felt the need to make the voice resemble the caller’s, she said it was about personal connection.\nZack explained that her parents live in India, and though they speak English, they’re not very fluent. That makes for some difficulty when they call Zack’s kids. Simply adding a robotic voice that’s translating between the grandparents and the children wouldn’t feel right, either. I was initially skeptical that fully replacing the caller’s original voice with a translated version would help, but after a few demos, I am certainly swayed.\nTo be clear, the person placing the call has to do so from a Pixel phone for Voice Translate to work. Once you choose Voice Translate from the Call Assist submenu, you’ll have to choose a language. When the call is connected, the system will say to both parties that the “Call is translated by Google AI in each speaker’s voice. Audio is not saved.”\nI tried this out a few times with a Google representative who spoke German, whom we will refer to as “Uncle Tim” to make it easier for me to describe this demo. Each time he spoke, I could hear a couple seconds of his voice in German, before a chime played and the version in the original language became softer. What sounded like a dubbed actor playing Uncle Tim came on and conversed in English, complete with realistic replications of pitch, rhythm and expression.\nI also could hear feedback when I talked on the call, so I heard myself speaking German on the other end. It was truly strange, because it sort of did sound like me. One of my closest friends lives in Germany, and has had to put up with my attempts to learn German for more than 10 years. I immediately wanted to try Voice Translate on her to see if she would believe I had suddenly become fluent (but of course, I’d have to figure out how to get her to ignore the warnings that Google AI was at work).\nI’ll be honest, the experience wasn’t perfect. Not only were the translations sometimes off (some of what Uncle Tim said in English didn’t make sense), the generated voices seemed less like a complete replication of the caller and more like a novice dubbing artist. That’s not a bad thing, since I was very concerned about impersonation being a problem.\nTo that end, Zack said Google was deliberate about the implementation. She reminded me of the “ducking” that was in place, which is when the original speech is still audible in the first few seconds and then softer throughout. Like the original audio is ducking below the dubbed voice — get it? And I remembered that while the AI voice might sound sort of like me, it isn’t designed to simply make up things I’m saying — it’s just translating the content. I’m the one that decides whether to go off and curse out a relative and have that conveyed in their native tongue, for example.\nOf course, there may still be bugs and quirks to work out. I was amused by the various accents that came through in the English-speaking version of Uncle Tim. At first he sounded American, but in subsequent conversations he took on an Australian accent.\nAll this is powered by the Pixel 10’s Tensor G5 chip and processed on-device using “a new codec and semantic understanding,” according to Zack, to understand the speaker’s vocal expressions. For now, I see what Google is going for and cannot wait to call my friend in Frankfurt.\nAt launch, Voice Translate will support translating to or from English with Spanish, German, Japanese, French, Hindi, Italian, Portuguese, Swedish, Russian and Indonesian.\nGoogle/Screenshot by Engadget\nMagic Cue surfacing your flight info when you call your airline is helpful\nThe recorder app, translation and expressive-sounding AI are areas Google has long proven expertise in. And lest we forget, the company has also been a pioneer in suggesting actions from your emails and adding events to your calendar by scanning your inbox. With the Pixel 10’s Magic Cue feature, Google is basically bringing this functionality to your texts and calls.\nWhile Magic Cue can helpfully show shortcuts within the Messages app to help you answer questions about reservations or send photos from recent trips, I’m most into one specific aspect. When you call an airline to make changes to a flight, for instance, the Pixel 10 can pull up your reservation information and display it within the call, so you won’t have to open your email, and search for the booking confirmation to have your reference number ready. Sure, it might only save you seconds, but it’s so much easier, and Google already does a version of this in your inbox.\nI would love to see this particular feature expand and cover other types of appointments so you can quickly get codes or other identifying information during calls to, say, your plumber, doctor, insurance provider and more.\nCamera and photo features continue to improve\nGoogle continues to improve upon areas it’s led the way in, and photography remains a strength of Pixel phones. The company was one of the first major players to use its algorithmic prowess to dramatically improve the quality of low light photos and with the Pixel 10 Pro it again uses computational processing to deliver superior images.\nPro Res Zoom on the new phone did manage to produce some surprisingly clean pictures of faraway buildings, at least in my demo at Google’s Manhattan office. I was impressed by how clear the lines on the underside of a skyscraper that we zoomed to a 100x level on looked. Google was also careful to clarify that Pro Res Zoom won’t work on people, and that distant text may look odd. \n\"We've tuned Pro Res Zoom to minimize hallucinations, however they may still occur — especially with faraway text. Additionally, when Pro Res Zoom detects a person in the scene, we use a different enhancement algorithm that prevents inaccurate representations,\" according to Google.\nin those situations, the algorithm will drop to Super Res Zoom quality. Depending on which Pixel phone you’re using, Super Res Zoom delivers up to either 20x or 30x zoom.\nIn the results I saw, people standing on a deck at the top of a tower just seemed a bit pixelated compared to the building’s facade, and the effect wasn’t jarring or even really noticeable until I zoomed in. But that might be because they were a tiny part of the picture — I imagine things would look different if a person was the main subject in a scene.\nAs someone who enjoys composing pictures, I didn’t think the Camera Coach feature would do anything for me. But I was pleasantly surprised that I actually liked some of the AI’s proposed framing options. I still don’t think I’ll use this much in the real world, but it might help other people who want tips on photography.\n\nI was initially nonplussed about the new Photos feature that lets you tell the AI how to edit your pictures, but after a brief demo I came around. Simply telling Gemini to “turn that red dress blue” or “get rid of the people in the background” was not only easier, but suprrisingly effective. I also want to point out that Google also made tweaks to the Guided Frame feature in its camera app that helps those who are blind or visually impaired know what is in the scene. It now uses Gemini models, which should help with object recognition.\nFinally, it’s worth calling out the support for C2PA content authenticity initiative. Google is building this into the Photos app, where metadata will show whether or not AI was used in a picture. The Pixel 10 phones will be the first to implement the new industry-standard Content Credentials (CR) within its native camera app, and companies like Adobe, Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft, OpenAI are all part of the initiative. \nAn assortment of other updates worthy of mention\nThose were just a slice of the new AI-related features I was impressed by at my recent demos ahead of Google’s event this week. But there are quite a few more I found promising, like visual overlays in Gemini Live and the new Pixel Journal app. I didn’t spend as much time with either, but they worked in my brief demos. So did the “take a message” feature that will send transcriptions of voicemails to you, which seems like a much better way to be alerted to a missed call than a hidden section of the Phone app.\nI’m not yet sold on the Daily Hub, which is basically an updated version of the existing pages that sit to the left of the home page showing relevant actions and articles you might want to explore. I’m fairly intentional when it comes to looking for things to consume, and have specific apps I prefer for doomscrolling (Reddit over everything), so I’m not sure Daily Hub will suit me.\nStill, the fact that I liked the bulk of the new AI features coming to the Pixel 10 series is pretty significant. Of course, I will still reserve judgement until I can spend more time with them in the real world, and hope to write reviews of some of them. But it’s clear from my time with demos of the Pixel 10 that Google has been pretty thoughtful about how it imbues its hardware with AI, and I hope its competitors take notes.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/my-favorite-google-ai-features-from-the-pixel-10-launch-130023979.html?src=rss",

    "full_text": "A big reason that BoJack Horseman worked so well was contrast. It’s part of what made its oddball jokes work so well, as they helped balance out the darker moments that explored topics like mental health and addiction. The same could be said for its spiritual offshoot Tuca & Bertie, which ramped up the wackiness — sexy plant ladies, ghost cakes — but didn’t shy away from getting real. Now we have Long Story Short, which comes from much of the same creative team; it’s led by BoJack creator Raphael Bob-Waksberg, while Tuca showrunner (and BoJack production designer) Lisa Hanawalt is a producer. Over the years more people get pulled into the Schwooper orbit, including Shira’s workaholic girlfriend Kendra (Nicole Byer) and Avi’s eventual wife, Jen (Angelique Cabral). An episode about Shira trying to learn how to cook her mother’s old knish recipe starts with the story of how her and Kendra first met — and bonded over the fact that Shira is a terrible cook. But that seemingly unrelated opening scene makes it clear why cooking the meal is so challenging, while other glimpses at Shira’s childhood, and her mother’s constant criticism, also make it clear why it’s so important to get right. Some of these revelations only really click a few episodes later, when various pieces from various time periods finally fit together in a really emotionally satisfying way. Long Story Short may not have Mr. Peanut Butter or plotlines about bugs who like to party, but it does get pretty silly. Long Story Short is warmer and more familiar — it’s about a family, after all, instead of a depressed Hollywoo celebrity — but still isn’t afraid to get dark and serious."

But what exactly makes a song catchy, and which songs are the catchiest? \"A 'catchy' song is one that easily sticks in your head (an earworm) and makes you want to sing, hum or move along.\" I do not, but the ChatGPT list didn't have any obvious hallucinations or weird choices. It agreed with ChatGPT on only two songs, including the Spice Girls' Wannabe and Pharrell Williams' Happy -- and it agreed a lot more with the museum's 2014 study, including on Lou Bega's Mambo No. Microsoft's Copilot AI included some familiar titles on its list of catchiest songs, with Wannabe right at the top. \"Beats per minute has a lot to do with it,\" Pomeroy says. Chappell Roan's Pink Pony Club and Hot To Go are among the more recent songs mentioned when catchy tunes come up. \"Anything that's trending on TikTok tends to be requested,\" Lee says. \"Any songs that are earwormy and get stuck in your head -- even when you don't want them to be there,\" Lee says."

    "summary": "Labor Day marks the unofficial end to summer as the weather starts to get crisper and students head back to school for the new semester. It also marks a good time to check out the tech deals available across the web. While seasonal holidays like Memorial Day and Labor Day are not the boon for tech sales that shopping events like Amazon Prime Day are, they can present good opportunities to save on things like laptops, tablets, smart home gear and more.Here, we've curated the best Labor Day sales on tech we could find this year. Since this time of year does overlap with the back-to-school season, students should be first in line to check out these deals. If you need some new gadgets for college, or refreshed tech to help you out in your first job after graduating, now's the time to see if you can get it for less. Student discounts are handy and exclusive to those who can prove their student status, but the good thing about Labor Day sales is that anyone can take advantage of them — student ID not required.\nBest Labor Day sales: Engadget's top picks\n\n\nApple AirPods Pro 2 for $169 (32 percent off): The AirPods Pro 2 are Apple’s best set of wireless earbuds for now, as they offer the full set of Apple-focused features, strong ANC, onboard volume controls, a comfy in-ear design and a warm sound profile that most should find agreeable. They can even work as a hearing aid, though their six-hour battery life still isn’t the best, and you should only get them if you’re all-in on Apple hardware. But if that’s the case, we consider them the best wireless earbuds for iPhone owners. \nApple Mac mini M4 for $499 ($100 off): The newest version of Apple’s tiny desktop PC has a smaller overall footprint, a faster M4 chip, 16GB of RAM as standard, two front-facing USB-C ports, an extra Thunderbolt 4 port and the ability to drive three external displays. We gave the M4 Pro model a review score of 90.\nSony WH-1000XM5 headphones for $274 (32 percent off): The XM6 headphones may be the latest flagship pair from Sony, but the XM5 cans are still fantastic — especially when you can get them at a discount. They were our top pick for the best wireless headphones before the XM6 came out recently, and we still think the XM5 have excellent noise cancellation and sound quality, a comfortable design and handy features like multipoint connectivity.\nGoogle Pixel 10 smartphone + $100 Amazon gift card for $799 ($100 off): More of a pre-order deal than a Labor Day deal, this bundle includes a free gift card when you order the latest Google Pixel phone in advance. You'll find different gift card deals at Amazon depending on which phone you go with: the Pixel 10 Pro and Pro XL have a $200 gift cards included, while the Pixel 10 Pro Fold comes with a free $300 gift card.\nBlink Outdoor 4 security cameras (3 camera system) for $100 (47 percent off): Some of our favorite security cameras, Blink Outdoor 4 devices support 1080p video, two-way talk, motion alerts and night vision. The most convenient thing about these is that they're totally wireless and run on AA batteries that can last up to two years before you need to replace them. That combined with their weather-proof design allows you to place them both inside and outside.\nEufy 11S Max robot vacuum for $150 (46 percent off): This model is one of our favorite budget robot vacuums thanks to its slim design that lets you get underneath furniture more easily and strong suction power for its size. Note that it does not have Wi-Fi connectivity, but it comes with a remote that lets you control the robot to your liking.\nShark AI Ultra robot vacuum for $298 (50 percent off): This Shark robot vacuum is a version of one of our favorites and it comes with a auto-empty base that can hold up to 60 days worth of debris. It has strong suction power and home mapping capabilities, so you can tailor cleaning jobs to your liking in addition to putting the robot on a cleaning schedule.\nCosori 9-in-1 air fryer for $90 (25 percent off): One of our picks for the best air fryers, this Cosori model has a spacious six-quart cooking basket and nine prep modes to choose from. In our testing, it consistently crisped up all kinds of foods, from frozen appetizers to raw proteins, and it has a nifty safety feature with its built-in basket release button.\nHORI Piranha Plant camera for Switch 2 for $40 (33 percent off): If you plan on taking advantage of the Switch 2's video and group chat feature, there's no cuter way to do it than with this Piranha Plant camera. In addition to using it with the pot as a stand, the plant itself detaches from the pot so you can use the camera in portable mode with the USB port on the new console.\nESPN Unlimited with Disney+ and Hulu (with ads) for $30/month ($6/month off): ESPN’s new streaming service is officially available now, and new subscribers can get Disney+ and Hulu included for one year when they sign up. The regular price of the new ESPN Unlimited plan is $30 per month, but this bundle offer throws in Disney+ and Hulu (with ads) for one year at no extra cost. If you want to break it down, you’re essentially getting each of the three services for $10 monthly with this offer.\nNordVPN deal — Get up to 77 percent off two-year plans: Most of NordVPN's two-year plans are on sale right now. You'll get 77 percent off the Prime tier, bringing the price down to $189 for 27 months of service (Nord throws in an extra three months for free). Arguably the best plan for most people is the Plus tier, which is 73 percent off and down to $108 for the 27-month term.\nMasterClass deal — Get 50 percent off one-year subscriptions: You can sign up for one year of MasterClass access for as low as $5 per month thanks to this sale that runs through September 1. A subscription lets you watch hundreds of online video classes taught by experts in their fields, and subject matter ranges from writing to cooking to sports.\nBest Labor Day sales on tech\n\nBeats Studio Pro headphones for $180 (49 percent off)\n8Bitdo Ultimate 2C Wired Controller for $15 (25 percent off)\nSony WH-1000XM4 headphones for $198 (43 percent off)\nAnker 621 5K magnetic power bank for $28 (30 percent off)\nAnker MagGo 10K Qi2 magnetic power bank for $60 (25 percent off)\nAmazon Fire Max 11 tablet for $175 (24 percent off)\nNothing Headphones (1) for $269 ($30 off)\nSonos back-to-school sale: Save up to 25 percent on headphones and speakers\nOoni Labor Day sale: Get 20 percent off the Koda 2 Max and save on other pizza ovens\nSolo Stove Labor Day sale: Get 20 percent off fire pits and 15 percent off select accessories\nMeater Labor Day sale: Get up to 27 percent off smart meat thermometers\n\nFollow @EngadgetDeals on X for the latest tech deals and buying advice.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-labor-day-sales-for-2025-save-on-tech-from-apple-sony-shark-and-others-120049396.html?src=rss",

    "full_text": "\"The foldable market has matured to the point where one-[size]-fits-all does not apply anymore,\" said Francisco Jeronimo, vice president of devices at IDC. Its IP68 rating -- a first for this type of foldable -- offers a level of confidence for anyone who is less careful using the phone in environments more prone to damage. The Galaxy Z Fold 7 starts at a whopping $2,000 ($100 more than last year's Z Fold), while the Pixel 10 Pro Fold maintains its $1,799 price tag from last year (still not pocket change). Samsung slimming down its Z Fold 7 helps it feel like a standard slate phone when closed, at 8.9mm thick and just 4.2mm when open, weighing 215g. The Pixel 10 Pro Fold solves for those battery and IP shortcomings, but with the trade-off of strongly resembling last year's model rather than slimming down. It's 1 gram heavier than the 9 Pro Fold, clocking in at 258g. There is one key area where I feel like Google isn't quite living up to the \"Pro\" name in its Pixel 10 Pro Fold: the cameras. As foldables become sleeker, more powerful and more durable, it's likely that a growing number of people will consider them when purchasing their next smartphone. In 2027, it could jump to 11% year-over-year growth. \"Nevertheless, we expect foldables to continue representing less than 3% of total sales by 2029.\""

    "full_text": "New Digg operates similarly to Reddit: people submit links that others can comment and vote on, and links with a lot of “diggs” (upvotes) will bubble up the feed. You can also tap a downvote-like “bury” button, but on posts (not comments), the bury button functions more as a signal to Digg to minimize that type of content in your own feed. Under the categories, you can also see a horizontally scrolling carousel of different links, though I’m not quite sure how the app picks which ones to show there. (I haven’t noticed any issues with the summaries so far.) Under the main posts, you can read threaded comments and Digg or bury them. A great part of Reddit is finding a hyper-niche community about something you care about, but since users can’t make communities yet, I’ll have to keep getting my Hollow Knight: Silksong memes from r/silksong. Since Digg is still invite-only, there just aren’t that many people or posts on the site yet; it might be a while until the platform sees some truly legendary comments. There’s no way to chat privately with users on the platform, for example. I think Digg’s iOS app has a great foundation (as does the web app, which launched in July), and there’s a lot of room for it to get better with new features and more users. I don’t know if Digg will be the homepage of the internet once again, but it does at least seem like a place you might want to come back to."

Reports say a new Apple TV 4K box is coming this year. The A17 Pro chip was released with the iPhone 15 Pro models. It includes a six-core GPU that can handle graphics for high-budget and high-profile video games -- the type of games you usually find only on desktop computers and gaming consoles. If true, Apple could roll it out alongside an iPhone 17 or wait until later in the fall. It's also reported that Apple's next TV streaming box will have an Apple-made chip for Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connections, allowing for faster wireless speeds and reduced interference with accessories like headphones. It's yet another element that could improve the machine for high-performance gaming, but it could also make the Apple TV box better at managing a network of smart-home gadgets. In this week's One More Thing video, embedded above, I explain why adding a few more chips to this little box could mean big things for Apple's future, including positioning the next Apple TV to become a true gaming console.

If you're already going to spend that much on an electric toothbrush, I recommend the Phillips Sonicare 4100. I also noticed that Quip's motor isn't very powerful compared with models from Sonicare or Oral-B. My gums and teeth felt sensitive after using the CariPro, but I tend to experience dental sensitivity. This simple Oral-B brush is basic and doesn't have any special technology or paired apps. I have a very tight and small jaw, so this brush was uncomfortable for me to use. I also couldn’t justify the price when a less expensive brush could clean my teeth better. It might sound silly, but the experience really did make me want to brush better."

    "full_text": "Google announced plenty of new hardware at this week’s Made by Google event, but halfway through we were distracted by the brief appearance of what appeared to be a new, previously unknown Gemini-powered smart speaker. Now Android Headlines claims that this speaker is real, and will launch with new colors and the ability to pair with a Google TV Streamer. As seen briefly in the keynote video, it features a light around the base — rather than across the top, as on previous Google speakers — and a fabric finish. As for features, the big new one is that the speaker will apparently be able to pair with a Google TV Streamer to deliver spatial TV audio, a trick borrowed from Apple’s HomePods, which can connect to Apple TV hardware. Hopefully it can also connect to TVs that run the Google TV OS. It will apparently also include new natural voice options, the ability to detect unusual sounds like glass breaking or a smoke alarm, and full support for Matter. The company announced Gemini for Home this week, which will arrive on existing Nest smart speakers and displays from October this year. It will include a paid tier and support for Gemini Live, though it’s not clear which features will be gated behind the premium subscription. Android Headlines calls the new hardware the “Home Speaker,” though it’s not clear if that’s its full or final name. We also don’t know when it will be released, though a launch alongside Gemini for Home in the fall seems likely."

It’s a remarkable choice because the S25 Ultra looks even less like the T1 Phone’s official renders than the iPhone the company has previously used in promotions. Even Spigen noticed the dupe, saying what we’re all thinking in its reply on X: “??? 1 / 4 Here’s the full image Trump Mobile shared to X.

The company also no longer claims the phone will be made in the USA, instead saying there are “American hands behind every device.” The phone has shrunk dramatically since launch too, now promising a 6.25-inch screen, way down from the 6.78-inch display described when it was first announced."

Wearing compression socks during the day promotes better blood flow and improves circulation, so fluid is less likely to collect in your legs. Minimizing your fluid intake before bed is another strategy to help you pee less during the night. If possible, don't drink anything for two hours before you go to sleep. It's also a good idea to limit your beverage consumption in the late afternoon and evening. Research indicates that a large percentage of falls by older people occur at night in the bathroom.

Since the name was created by a marketing department, it doesn't have any legal or scientific meaning. It implies quantum dots since that's what the early \"Q\" models had, but nothing requires a TV called \"Q\" anything to have quantum dots.

    "summary": "After testing around a dozen ereaders, we think the best bet for most people is the Kobo Clara Colour. But the base-model Kindle is also good, offering a cheap and easy entry point into ebooks. And Boox makes a few E Ink readers that do more than just display books. Now that most ereader companies also offer color models, the field is wider than ever. In short, there are a few things to consider before buying your next (or first) ereader and this guide covers product recommendations alongside advice on how to get the most out of your new device.\nTable of contents\n\nBest ereaders\nWhat to look for in an ereader\nHow to get books for your ereader\nHow we test ereaders\nEreader FAQs\nRecent updates\n\nThe best ebook readers for 2025\n \n  \n \n \n\n \n \n \nWhat to look for in an ereader\nPlenty of apps, including the Kindle app, will let you download and read digital books on an iPhone, Android Phone or tablet. But what makes ebook readers different is the screen: nearly all of them use technology from a company called E Ink. It manufactures electronic paper displays (EPD) composed of three sheets: one containing millions of microcapsules filled with black and white ink particles sandwiched between transparent electrode layers. When a charge is applied, either the black or white particles shift to the top, forming letters and the whitespace around them. \nColor ereaders add a color filter array on top of the standard black and white microcapsule layer. The result is two different resolutions on one screen — the color clarity is 150 dpi while black and white images and text are still 300 dpi.\nBecause these displays are so different from standard backlight LED panels, you can expect most good ereaders to do a number of things well. They’ll be easier to stare at for long periods of time and easier to read in direct sunlight. Also, since E Ink displays only require power to rearrange the ink, these devices have much longer battery lives than even the best tablets: we’re talking weeks on a single charge, not days.\nThe ereader market is not as saturated as, say, the smartphone market, but there are still plenty of options out there and they do have small but important differences among them. They tend to range from around $100 to more than $400, though usually the higher end options are stylus-enabled read/write E Ink tablets like the Kindle Scribe. Beyond price, you should consider physical properties like buttons, lights, storage and resolution, as well as how the software lets you find and access books.\nReading features\nWith any ereader, you’ll navigate the OS via taps and swipes, and some add physical page-turn buttons. Most with built-in buttons have an auto-rotating screen so you can press with your right or left hand.\nAs E Ink technology has advanced, resolution has greatly improved – even the budget Kindle ereader has a 300 ppi display. You can still find models with lower resolution, but we don’t recommend them.\nSome ereaders have front LEDs that support light temperature adjustment. That means you can switch to a warmer light after the sun goes down, which will feel easier on the eyes. If you’re concerned about blue light, you should go for a reader with that feature. Finally, dark mode is available on most later model ereaders, allowing you to invert the black and white text and background, which some people find easier to read in low-light settings. \nOther features\nThe capabilities of these pocket libraries have advanced considerably since the early days. In addition to storing books, some let you browse the web, run apps and play music. The screen’s frame rate can’t handle gaming, but it’s good enough to show you the Wikipedia entry for Striver’s Row while you read Crook Manifesto.\nIf you listen to audiobooks, you may want a Bluetooth-enabled ereader capable of playing them. Most of the models we tested have that ability, with the notable exception of the Nook ereader we tried. Keep in mind that audiobook files can take up more space than print files so you'll probably want a device with a higher storage capacity if you plan on doing a lot of listening.\nAbove all, you should consider where and how you intend to find books to read. Most ereaders make it easiest to shop through their own digital bookstores, but all of them (even Kindles) will now let you download titles from other sources, like libraries, unaffiliated ebook sellers and free public domain sites.\n\n\n\n\n   Photo by Amy Skorheim / Engadget \n \n\nHow to get books for your ereader\nKindle, Nook and Kobo all have their own stores that you access directly from each brand’s devices. Prices are the same among all sellers, too. Publishers set the price of an ebook, not the retailer, so a title will cost the same at Amazon, Barnes & Noble, eBooks.com and the Kobo store.\nAmazon offers Kindle Unlimited for $12 per month, and it includes four million titles from which you can pick your next read. It includes audio and ebooks, but you won’t find many big, new releases or older bestsellers. Kobo has a subscription called Kobo Plus with about 1.3 million titles: it goes for $8 per month for ebooks only, $8 for audiobooks only or $10 for both.\nBuying a book from a proprietary store instantly delivers it to your device, provided you’re connected to WiFi. It also syncs your reading across devices and apps, so you can pick up where you left off on your phone if you forgot your ereader at home. It truly is the most convenient way to go, but if you don’t want to be locked into one brand’s store, or if you opt for an ereader without its own marketplace, you do have options.\nHow to upload ePubs onto an ereader\nStores like ebooks.com and Google Play have millions of ebooks for sale as digital rights-managed (DRM) ePub files, which Kobo, Nook and PocketBook readers can read in their native ereader apps. Kindles don’t support DRM ePub files at all and Boox devices require third party reading apps (of which there are many) to read those files. Titles from Apple Books are only readable in iOS devices. \nTitles from some publishers like Tor and public domain classics from sites like Project Gutenberg are also sold as ePubs, but without the added DRM. Consequently, Kindles and the Boox Neoreader do support those files. Books you get from third-party sources will look just like ones you bought from a proprietary store, thanks to the flowable, formatted nature of ePub files. While these device-agnostic ebook collections give you extra options for finding your next read, they require a few additional steps to get the files onto your ereader.\nTo do so, you’ll typically need a computer running a free program called Adobe Digital Editions (ADE). After buying and downloading the ePub file, open ADE and plug your ereader into your computer (all readers here have a USB-C port for charging and data transfers). Your device should pop up in the left panel. Drag and drop the ePub file from your downloads folder into the main panel in ADE. The file will display as an image of the book cover. Drag that image onto your device on the left panel. If the file includes digital rights management (which protects against unauthorized copying) you’ll need to authorize your ereader, which requires using or creating a free Adobe ID. Once you’ve finished adding files to upload, eject the reader from your computer to complete the transfer process.\nKindles use a web-based uploader instead of the ADE method. But since Kindle uses its own proprietary DRM technology instead of Adobe's, the only files it can accept from third parties are non-DRM files, such as from Tor Publishing or Project Gutenberg. After downloading a compatible ePub file, drag and drop it into your browser with the Send to Kindle page open. As long as you’re signed into Amazon, this wirelessly transfers the files to your associated device.\nBoox also uses a browser uploader called BooxDrop (along with many other methods) to deliver ePubs to the device. Open it from the Boox App menu and you’ll see a device-specific url. Type that into your browser to access a file delivery portal that uploads to your library. Boox’s built-in ereader app, NeoReader, also doesn’t support files with DRM, so you won’t be able to read current titles from most publishers using that app. Fortunately, Boox devices run nearly every ereader app out there, Kobo and Kindle included, letting you access ePubs any number of ways.\nRecently, Bookshop.org, the online seller of physical books that supports indie bookstores, started selling ebooks and up to 100 percent of the profits will go to local booksellers. The company uses a different rights management system than ADE so, right now, you can only read titles you buy from them on the Bookshop.org app, but the company is working with the makers of both Kindle and Kobo to extend compatibility to those ereaders.\nHow to read library books on an ereader\nYour local library card lets you borrow audio and ebooks through a program called Overdrive and its companion app Libby. On a Kobo, you have have built-in access to Overdrive in a separate tab. Once you’ve linked your public library card, the search function will include results for titles available from your local library system; a few taps will upload your selections to your device for the length of the loan. I personally find it easiest to borrow the title I want through the Libby app on my phone. After that, the book pops up on my Kobo’s home screen once the device syncs.\nTo read library books on a Kindle, you can either go through the Libby app or the Overdrive section of your library’s website. Once you click Borrow, you’ll see the option to “Read now with Kindle,” which takes you to Amazon’s site to sign in. After that, the book will be delivered to your device the next time it connects to WiFi.\nFor other ereaders, you’ll go through your library’s Overdrive portal and download the ePub after clicking the Borrow button. You can then use the ADE process we described above. Devices that run external apps, like Boox's Page, Go Color 7 or Palma, allow you to read library books via the Libby app, just as you would on a smartphone or iPad.\nYou can also use the Libby app to borrow audiobooks, but you won’t be able to access them through your ereader. (The exception is an ereader, like a Boox device, that allows external apps). I found it was easier to listen to an audiobook on my phone anyway, regardless of whether I borrowed it through Libby or bought it from Kindle or Kobo.\n\n\n\n\n   Photo by Amy Skorheim / Engadget \n \n\nHow we test ereaders\nWhen putting together any guide, the first thing we do is spend hours researching the field. We look at what’s available, what’s new, and what shoppers and professional reviewers have to say. Then we narrow a list to the best candidates for hands-on testing.\nOver the course of the past two years, I’ve tested just over a dozen ereaders, representing five different brands: Amazon, Kobo, Barnes & Noble, Boox and PocketBook. I bought, borrowed and uploaded books for each device using the methods above. I used each one for between a few days to a few months. I evaluated each one in the areas of book access, ease of reading, extra features and overall value. Here’s everything we tested so far:\n\nAmazon Kindle (2022)\nAmazon Kindle (2024)\nAmazon Kindle Paperwhite (2021)\nAmazon Kindle Paperwhite Signature (2024)\nBoox Go Color 7 \nBoox Leaf 2\nBoox Page\nBoox Poke 5\nBoox Palma\nKobo Libra 2\nKobo Libra Colour\nKobo Clara 2E\nKobo Clara Colour\nKobo Nia\nNOOK GlowLight 4 \nPocketBook Era\n\nOther ereaders we tested\nAmazon Kindle Colorsoft\nAmazon’s first color Kindle impressed with its quick page-turns and load times, auto-adjusting front light and, of course, a decently striking color E Ink display. But at $280, it’s more expensive than all of the other color ereaders in its size range, including the Kobo Libra Colour and the Boox Go Color 7.\nAlso, some Colorsoft owners reported seeing a yellow band at the bottom of their ereader’s display. This issue did not affect our first review unit during the original testing period, but it eventually appeared. An Amazon spokesperson told Engadget: \"A small number of customers have reported a yellow band along the bottom of the display. We take the quality of our products seriously—customers who notice this can reach out to our customer service team for a replacement or refund, and we’re making the appropriate adjustments to ensure that new devices will not experience this issue moving forward.\"\nAmazon sent us a new Colorsoft ereader at the end of 2024 and it does appear that the fixes the company made resolved the yellow-band issue. The screen on our second review unit appears warmer overall, but not overly so. It’s more akin to the screen on the Kobo Libra Colour, and that’s a good thing.\nBoox Go 7 stylus-enabled ereader\nBoox recently released two new stylus-enabled generations of their seven-inch reader: The monochrome Go 7 and a color-screen Go Color 7 (Gen II). After trying out the stylus-enabled Go 7, I still like the standard, non-stylus enabled version better. True, I liked the Notebook app with its array of handwriting templates and I appreciated the low-to-no latency with the stylus. It also offers a good assortment of brush, pen and style options. But outside of the Notebook app, I didn’t find much use for the stylus.\nI was able to doodle in the margins of DRM-free books in Boox’s native NeoReader, but it doesn’t work in other apps or on any rights-managed books. There's a FreeMark option that allows you to draw or write atop any app, but it saves your doodles as separate images, as opposed to allowing you to mark up the page itself. I also found enabling the stylus to be a little glitchy. If you plan to do a lot of writing, you’ll probably be better served by an E Ink tablet, but if you want an ereader that can mark up your books, I suggest going with the Kobo Libra Color, detailed above.\nEreader FAQs\nWhat's the difference between an ereader and an e-ink reader?\nReally, they are the same thing. E Ink is a company that designs and manufactures the paper-like screens found in most ereader devices. Technically, anything you read ebooks on can act as an ereader, so your phone, iPad or Android tablet could all serve that purpose, but they’re not considered dedicated ereaders. While there are some devices marketed as ereaders that have LCD or OLED screens instead of E Ink, they aren’t as common. One of the benefits of ereaders is the E Ink screen’s paper-like quality, which causes less eye strain for many people.\nBut there is a difference between ereaders and E Ink tablets. These larger e-ink devices also employ E Ink screens, but they have stylus input and are often used for note taking and other tasks in addition to reading ebooks. We have an entire guide devoted to helping you pick out an E Ink tablet.\nAre there ads on my ereader?\nThe base model Kindle and Kindle Paperwhite come with ads by default, but you can opt to pay $20 to remove them, either at the time of purchase or after you start using the device. The ads are limited to the lockscreen and are typically for other books or Kindle services. Kobo and Boox ereaders don’t come with ads.\nWhich ereader has the longest battery life?\nOf the devices we tested, the Boox Go Color 7 has the largest listed battery capacity at 2,300mAh (Amazon doesn’t list the capacity of its Kindle devices). But thanks to the nature of E Ink screens and the relatively limited processing power required to display e-books, nearly all ereaders can go for weeks before they need a recharge. That means battery life probably isn’t as much of a deciding factor in buying an ereader as it would be with a tablet or smartphone.\nWhich ereaders can read Kindle books?\nAmazon’s Kindle ereaders are the obvious answer, but other devices capable of running apps can also read titles from the Kindle store. For example, you can download the Kindle app on a Boox ereader through Google Play (the store comes standard in the Boox app menu). You can then sign into your Kindle account and access all the books in your library — the same way you’d read Kindle books on your phone or tablet.\nCan you buy Kindle books without a Kindle?\nYes. You can buy Kindle books through the Kindle app or through Amazon’s website via a browser. You can read those titles on a Kindle or any device that can run the Kindle app, such as a smartphone, tablet or computer. Just be aware that Kindle titles can only be read through one of Amazon’s ereaders or the Kindle app. The company uses proprietary digital rights management on all ebooks it sells that can’t be read by other ereader apps like Kobo or Adobe ADE.\nWhat's the difference between Kindle and Kobo?\nBoth Kindle and Kobo are brands of dedicated ereaders that support searching, buying, downloading and reading ebooks from their own stores. Both also support borrowing books from your local library via Overdrive and Libby.\nThe difference is that Kindle is owned by Amazon and uses the Kindle store, whereas Kobo is owned by Rakuten and its books come from the Kobo store. Both stores come pre-loaded as a tab on their respective ereader and both carry most in-print books. Each store also carries their own exclusive ebooks as well, but Amazon’s library of Kindle-only books is much larger than Kobo’s. Amazon also offers Amazon Original stories to read on the Kindle, which are free short fiction and nonfiction reads that are free to Prime members.\nWhich ereader is best for library books?\nBoth Kobos and Kindles have simple systems for borrowing library books. Other ereaders, like Boox, let you borrow books after downloading the Libby App. Only Kobo ereaders let you search for and borrow books directly on the ereader, with a dedicated Overdrive tab. Kindles, on the other hand, utilize a convenient “read on Kindle” function from the Libby app or website. You can send a borrowed book to your Kindle just by signing into your account. Both methods are pretty easy, so which is the best for you probably depends on other factors than just the library-book feature.\nRecent updates\nAugust 2025: Included new frequently asked questions covering battery life, E Ink screens and ads on ereaders. Mentioned Amazon’s release of a cheaper Colorsoft Kindle.\nJuly 2025: Added our impressions of the new stylus-enabled Boox Go 7 series. Updated our Boox Palma recommendation to account for the upgrades to the Boox Palma 2. Included text formats to our specs and the battery life of the Kobo Clara Colour.\nMarch 2025: Added news about Bookshop.org getting into the ebook market. Updated information about price-setting by publishers.\nJanuary 2025: Updated the \"Others we tested\" section to include impressions of the second Kindle Colorsoft review unit we received.\nAugust 2024: Replaced our Android tablet pick with the new Go Color 7 ereader from Boox. Updated book titles to current examples. Added an FAQ section to explain the difference between Kobo and Kindle ereaders and further detail library-book support on different models. \nNovember 2024: Following the release of Amazon's new Kindle ereaders, we tested and reviewed the Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition, the base-model Kindle and Amazon's new color ereader, the Kindle Colorsoft. Accordingly, we updated our budget pick, added a premium pick and noted our experience with the Colorsoft. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/best-ereader-130013808.html?src=rss",
    "full_text": "When Rakuten announced the Clara would be updated, I worried we’d see Kobo device with superfluous revamping to justify an inflated price. Rakuten still makes the Kobo Clara BW, which is nearly identical to our previous \"best overall\" pick. I created one with larger text and wider line spacing called “tired eyes.” Some people won’t be bothered by the lock screen ads that come standard on this Kindle (unless you pay $20 to remove them). You can pick from four different highlighter colors and view your written notes and spotlighted text in the notes section of any title — which I could see being pretty useful for book club reads, school assignments or just refreshing yourself on a past read before you dive into the sequel. While there is a store, it’s made up of public domain titles — most people will read books by uploading ePubs manually. But what makes ebook readers different is the screen: nearly all of them use technology from a company called E Ink. Because these displays are so different from standard backlight LED panels, you can expect most good ereaders to do a number of things well. Amazon offers Kindle Unlimited for $12 per month, and it includes four million titles from which you can pick your next read. After downloading a compatible ePub file, drag and drop it into your browser with the Send to Kindle page open. The company uses proprietary digital rights management on all ebooks it sells that can’t be read by other ereader apps like Kobo or Adobe ADE."

    "summary": "Whether you're working in a noisy office, commuting on a packed train or just trying to focus at home, a good pair of noise-canceling headphones can make all the difference. The best noise-canceling headphones block out distractions and let you enjoy your music, podcasts or calls in peace — all while delivering great sound quality and all-day comfort. From models with plush cushions to wireless cans with loads of extra features, there’s something here for every style and budget.\nTable of contents\n\nBest noise-canceling headphones for 2025\nHow to choose the best noise-canceling headphones for you\nHow we test noise-canceling headphones\nOther noise-canceling headphones we tested\nNoise-canceling headphones FAQs\n\nBest noise-canceling headphones of 2025\n \n \n \n \n \n\nHow to choose the best noise-canceling headphones for you\nDesign\nWhen you’re shopping for the best wireless headphones, the first thing you’ll need to decide on is wear style. Do you prefer on-ear or over-ear headphones? For the purposes of this guide, I focus on the over-ear style as that’s what most noise-canceling headphones are nowadays. Sure, you can find on-ear models with ANC, but over-ear, active noise-canceling headphones are much more effective at blocking outside sounds since your ears are completely covered. \nFor gamers, there are also gaming headsets that feature noise cancellation — some even have detachable microphones, so they can double as over-ear headphones. However, for the purpose of this article, we’re only going to be focusing on noise-canceling headphones rather than headsets. Look for models with a comfortable headband and memory foam ear cups to ensure you can wear them for long periods without discomfort.\nMany headphones also come with a range of color options, so if aesthetics matter to you, you’ll find plenty of choices beyond just black or white. Whether you’re looking for something neutral or a bold pop of color, brands now offer a variety of styles to match your personal taste.\nFinally, if you’re planning to wear your headphones for long periods of time, it’s important to pick a model with a comfortable fit. Memory foam ear cups, an adjustable headband, and lightweight materials can make all the difference during extended listening sessions. After all, great sound is only part of the equation; comfort matters just as much.\nType of noise cancellation\nNext, you’ll want to look at the type of ANC a set of headphones offers. You’ll come across terms like “hybrid active noise cancellation” or “hybrid adaptive active noise cancellation,” and there are key differences between the two. A hybrid ANC setup uses microphones on the inside and on the outside of the device to detect outside noise and cancel it out. By analyzing input from both mics, a hybrid system can combat more sounds than “regular” ANC, but it does so at a constant level that doesn’t change.\nAdaptive ANC takes the hybrid configuration a step further by continuously adjusting the noise cancellation for changes in your environment and any leakage around the padding of the ear cups. Adaptive noise-canceling also does a better job with wind noise, which can really kill your vibe while using headphones outdoors. Some high-end headphones also support Dolby Atmos, which enhances spatial audio and makes everything from music to movies sound more immersive. For the purposes of this best headphones list, I’m only considering products with hybrid ANC or adaptive ANC setups because those are the most effective at blocking noise and improving your overall listening experience.\nCustomization\nYou’ll also want to check to see if the ANC system on a prospective set of headphones offers adjustable levels of noise cancellation or presets. These can help you dial in the amount of ANC you need for various environments, but it can also help you save battery life. Master & Dynamic, for example, has ANC presets that provide both maximum noise blocking and more efficient cancellation that is more energy efficient. Other companies may include a slider in their companion apps that let you adjust the ANC level to your liking. Some high-end models even allow you to fine-tune the ANC for specific types of environments.\nHow we test noise-canceling headphones\nThe primary way we test headphones is to wear them as much as possible. I prefer to do this over a one-to-two-week period, but sometimes deadlines don’t allow it. During this time, I listen to a mix of music and podcasts, while also using the headphones to take both voice and video calls.\nSince battery life for headphones can be 30 hours or more, I drain the battery with looping music and the volume set at a comfortable level (usually around 75 percent). Due to the longer battery estimates, I’ll typically power the headphones off several times and leave them that way during a review. This simulates real-world use and keeps me from having to constantly monitor the process for over 24 straight hours.\nTo test ANC performance specifically, I use headphones in a variety of environments, from noisy coffee shops to quiet home offices. When my schedule allows, I use them during air travel since plane noise is a massive distraction to both work and relaxation. Even if I can’t hop on a flight, I’ll simulate a constant roar with white noise machines, bathroom fans, vacuums and more. I also make note of how well each device blocks human voices, which are a key stumbling block for a lot of ANC headphones.\nANC-related features are something else to consider. Here, I do a thorough review of companion apps, testing each feature as I work through the software. Any holdovers from previous models are double checked for improvements or regression. If the headphones I’m testing are an updated version of a previous model, I’ll spend time getting reacquainted with the older set. Ditto for the closest competition for each new set of headphones that I review.\nOther noise-canceling headphones we tested\nAirPods Max\nApple’s AirPods Max are premium, well-designed over-ear headphones that incorporate all of the best features you find on standard AirPods: solid noise cancellation, spatial audio and easy Siri access. However, their $550 starting price makes them almost prohibitively expensive, even for Apple users. There are better options available at lower prices, but if you can pick up the AirPods Max at a steep discount, they might be worthwhile for the biggest Apple fans among us.\nDyson On-Trac\nThe On-Trac headphones have an almost infinitely customizable design, and that’s what’s most unique about them. The sound profile offers some nice detail, but lacks dynamic range overall. ANC is average at best and there aren’t any advanced features that will make your life easier. Well, except for the hearing health monitor, which is actually handy. All told, that’s not a lot for a set of $500 headphones.\nSonos Ace\nThe Sonos Ace is an excellent debut for the company’s first headphones. The combination of refined design, great sound quality and home theater tricks creates a unique formula. However, ANC performance is just okay and key functionality is still in the works for many users.\nSony ULT Wear\nIf most headphones don’t have the level of bass you desire, the ULT Wear is an option to consider. The low-end thump isn’t for everyone, but there are also plenty of handy features and a refined look to make the $200 set more compelling than many in this price range.\nBeats Studio Pro\nThe Studio Pro lacks basic features like automatic pausing, and multipoint connectivity is only available on Android. Moreover, they’re not very comfortable for people with larger heads. Overall sound quality is improved, though, and voice performance on calls is well above average.\nMaster & Dynamic MH40 (2nd gen)\nThe MH40 are a great set of headphones if you favor crisp, clear and natural sound that isn’t overly tuned. This pair showcases the company’s affinity for leather and metal too, but limited customization and short battery life for non-ANC cans kept this set from making the cut.\nBowers & Wilkins Px8\nThe company’s trademark pristine sound is on display here, but the Px8 is more expensive and not nearly as comfortable as the Px7 S3.\nNoble Audio FoKus Apollo\nWhile this is my top pick for overall sound quality in our main guide to the best wireless headphones, the ANC performance is less impressive than the Px7 S3. Bowers & Wilkins gets the nod here for its improved noise cancellation over the Px7 S2 and Px7 S2e, and its overall excellent audio quality.\nNoise-canceling headphones FAQs\nDoes noise cancellation block all noise?\nNoise cancellation doesn’t block out all noise, though it does drastically reduce the volume of most external sounds.\nIs there a difference between wired vs wireless noise-canceling headphones?\nIn terms of sound quality, if you have two headphones — one wired and one wireless — with similar specs, the difference is going to be very minimal. However, wireless headphones offer more convenience, allowing you to move around more freely with your headphones on, which is why they often feature noise cancellation to minimize external sounds.\nDoes noise cancellation impact sound quality?\nANC does bear some weight on sound quality, but the impact of this often doesn’t outweigh the benefits. Noise cancellation reduces ambient noise, allowing a greater focus on audio detail. For audiophiles, however, there may be a small difference in sound fidelity when ANC is turned on.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/best-noise-canceling-headphones-130029881.html?src=rss",
    "full_text": "Bose has generally lagged the competition in terms of sonic prowess, but these over-ear headphones show that gap is narrowing. 40mm dynamic full-range bio cellulose drivers pipe in balanced tuning that provides you with the finest detail of any song. You won’t find more advanced features than those, but what Bowers & Wilkins does offer here is finely tuned and carefully polished. Adaptive noise-canceling also does a better job with wind noise, which can really kill your vibe while using headphones outdoors. Some high-end headphones also support Dolby Atmos, which enhances spatial audio and makes everything from music to movies sound more immersive. Other companies may include a slider in their companion apps that let you adjust the ANC level to your liking. This simulates real-world use and keeps me from having to constantly monitor the process for over 24 straight hours. When my schedule allows, I use them during air travel since plane noise is a massive distraction to both work and relaxation. ANC is average at best and there aren’t any advanced features that will make your life easier. The MH40 are a great set of headphones if you favor crisp, clear and natural sound that isn’t overly tuned."

It's also worth mentioning that you can hit the same button to pause lengthy radio conversations as well. One such example is killing Ocelot after meeting him for the first time. You'll miss out on important visuals while the game just shows your character looking into binoculars, for example. This gives you back your right thumb in order to regain camera control while dragging someone out of sight. This means silencers are quite important for avoiding gun fights and staying hidden. To avoid overusing them, remove the silencers anytime you engage in a big gun fight or boss battle. It allows you to see enemies through walls and will help spot bosses during big fights. With those 11 tips you'll now start off on a much stronger footing when playing through Metal Gear Solid Delta."

For longtime fans or newcomers, that's more than enough to make it a great remake. Metal Gear Solid Delta uses Unreal Engine 5, so the character models look amazing. There are also some \"quality of life\" changes, such as frequent auto-saves and quicker menu access. There's not even additional voice acting in this particular cutscene, just remixed dialogue from other scenes. The camo collection lets you track what gear you've unlocked (and what's still missing), while the food collection catalogs every animal and item Snake has eaten. If you've never played MGS3 and are curious, this remake is a must. But if that doesn't describe you, it's not an immediate pick-up. Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater will be released on Aug. 28 for PC, PS5 and Xbox Series X|S consoles."

While it’s unclear how far talks progressed between Musk and Zuckerberg, the mere idea of a partnership between the two billionaires represents just how much of a threat OpenAI poses. Two years ago, Musk said he would physically fight Zuckerberg in a cage match (though it never happened). The rise of AI may have prompted Musk and Zuckerberg to set aside their differences. Such a conversion is necessary for OpenAI to obtain funding from investors, and eventually go public. Lawyers representing Meta asked the court to reject OpenAI’s request for evidence, arguing that Musk and xAI can provide any relevant information. Meta also argues that its internal discussions of OpenAI’s restructuring and recapitalization are not relevant to the case."

During this year’s Anime NYC convention, Netflix announced that Deathwatch is slated to debut on October 14th, and the series has added The Sandman’s Kirby Howell-Baptiste to its cast. Howell-Baptiste will voice Zinnia McKenna, an agent working alongside Sam Fisher (Liev Schrieber) as they’re hunted by squads of trained killers. But things are going to be a bit different for the next season of Netflix’s take on Devil May Cry. Due out some time in 2026, Devil May Cry’s second season will see Dante (Johnny Yong Bosch) and Vergil (Robbie Daymond) reuniting for a battle to the death. That seems to be the plan for Blue Eye Samurai’s next season. Along with a scene from Blue Eye Samurai season 2 focused on Mizu (Maya Erskine) storming a stronghold, Netflix shared a behind-the-scenes featurette where series co-creators Amber Noizumi and Michael Green, and executive producer Jane Wu, tease some of what we can expect to see. It looks like Mizu’s quest for revenge will take her all the way to London and involve at least a couple of seemingly-dead characters making unexpected returns. Season 2 is still in production and doesn’t have a firm release date just yet. The big takeaway is that Netflix isn’t easing up on its animated projects."

The Dirt Devil BD5700V is notable for its classic bright red accents and remarkably lightweight body. Dustbin size could also be bigger; it's only 0.48 liters, meaning more frequent emptying during cleaning sessions. Levoit LVAC-200 also comes with a two-in-one crevice tool and a two-in-one pet tool to help clean up any and every mess, although it would have been nice to have some additional attachments for cleaning upholstery or digging deeper into carpet for pet hair. It only lasted 25 minutes during our testing, so you'll want to take a look at the Shark Stratos and Dreame Z30 for cordless vacuums that can last an hour or more.

We know more about Economos a little bit, or at least his weird brain. John Cena and Danielle Brooks return for season 2 of Peacemaker on HBO Max.

Powered by DeepMind's Project Mariner, the latest additions bring us further into the agentic AI future we've been promised for some time, directly from a search box. Most of the new features are either limited to premium AI subscribers and tucked behind an experiment in Google Labs, but it might not take long before they're a standard part of your future search experience. Google did not immediately respond to CNET's request for further comment. Instead of searching for restaurant reservations and then clicking on a specific website to make a reservation, AI Mode surfaces everything you need to complete the action right there. Since it's contextually aware, you can add specificities to your query that a typical Google search wouldn't handle well. You can add the type of cuisine, number of people, time and location to a single query, and AI Mode will get to work and display real-time restaurant reservation time slots to choose from. This feature is currently rolling out to Google AI Ultra subscribers in the US who have enabled the specific experiment in Labs. The experiment will use your past conversations with AI Mode, places you've interacted with on Search and Maps to provide suggestions tailored specifically to you.

Rather than selling off the valuable browser for an upfront windfall, this plan would see Google transforming Chrome into a foundation.

Under the arrangement, Ecosia would devote about 60 percent of Chrome's profits toward climate and environmental projects.

    "full_text": "More than two years after leaving the company, some former Twitter employees may finally receive their severance pay. Elon Musk’s X is tentatively settling a class action lawsuit filed by workers who were let go soon after he purchased Twitter. This news comes in the form of a court filing where both parties asked the court to delay an upcoming hearing so that they could work out a deal. After buying Twitter in 2022, Musk laid off over 6,000 Twitter employees, reducing the company’s headcount by around 80%. While Musk offered three months’ severance, the lawsuit claims that many former employees didn’t receive complete payments, while some didn’t receive any payment at all. The lawsuit also alleges that Musk’s offer of three months’ severance was lower than what employees expected from a Twitter severance plan that had been in place since 2019, which would have guaranteed senior employees severance of up to six months’ base pay, plus one week of pay per year of service. But in July, a U.S. District Judge in San Francisco ruled that Musk did not have to honor the severance agreements that these employees had entered with Twitter. The plaintiffs appealed the ruling, however, and the parties were set to enter oral arguments in a court of appeals next month before requesting that the hearing be delayed.

    "summary": "\nThe Apple iPhone event is nearly here, which means we'll soon get to download iOS 26 and iPadOS 26. The OS 26es are coming with huge upgrades to your iPhone and iPad's operating systems. You've heard of Liquid Glass, right? It's like the better-executed version of Windows Vista and definitely one of the cooler features coming this fall. We spent two weeks test-driving it — you can check out our detailed hands-on iOS 26 preview, or you can try it out yourself by downloading and installing the public beta 4. That software is a more stable iteration of the separate developer version, which recently hit the beta 7 waypoint, and offers a few more flashy features not yet available in the public version. (While the public beta is open to everyone and quite stable, always remember there's a degree of risk involved with beta software.) Additionally, there are credible reports that iOS 26 could bring a new live translation feature to AirPods, too. Not sure if you want to upgrade your smartphone or tablet this year? No worries, we'll help you find out if your devices will be able to run iOS 26.\nWhile Apple didn't nix any iPhones from its eligibility list last year, that's not the case for 2025 — a few models are getting cut this time. All iPhone 8 models and the iPhone X were the last to get the boot in 2023, and this year the 2018 models are getting left behind. If you have an ineligible device, you won't be able to download iOS 26 when it becomes available this fall. \nWe'll get to the bottom of which iPhones and iPads will support iOS 26 and iPadOS 26 this year. To see what's coming with the latest OSes, check out everything announced at Apple's WWDC June 9 event. One thing you shouldn't immediately expect is Apple's updated version of Siri, though the company is reportedly working on a 'stripped-down' AI chatbot to compete with ChatGPT. \nThese three iPhones won't be compatible with iOS 26\nUnlike last year, several iPhone models won't be eligible to download the newest iOS when it makes its debut this fall. This trio of models first released in 2018 won't be coming to the iOS 26 party:\n\niPhone XR\niPhone XS\niPhone XS Max\n\niPhones compatible with iOS 26\nWhile we don't yet know the new iPhones Apple will be dropping this fall — though there are iPhone 17 rumors — we do know, per Apple's site, that the phones listed below will be compatible with iOS 26. Basically, if you have an iPhone that was announced in 2019 or later, you're in the clear:\n\niPhone SE (second generation or later)\niPhone 11\niPhone 11 Pro\niPhone 11 Pro Max\niPhone 12\niPhone 12 mini\niPhone 12 Pro\niPhone 12 Pro Max\niPhone 13\niPhone 13 mini\niPhone 13 Pro\niPhone 13 Pro Max\niPhone 14\niPhone 14 Plus\niPhone 14 Pro\niPhone 14 Pro Max\niPhone 15\niPhone 15 Plus\niPhone 15 Pro\niPhone 15 Pro Max\niPhone 16\niPhone 16 Plus\niPhone 16 Pro\niPhone 16 Pro Max\niPhone 16e\n\niPads compatible with iPadOS 26\nThe iPads listed below, and any iPads released later this year, are eligible to download iPadOS 26.\n\niPad Pro (M4)\niPad Pro 12.9‑inch (3rd generation and later)\niPad Pro 11‑inch (1st generation and later)\niPad Air (3rd generation and later, including M2 and M3)\niPad (8th generation and later, including A16)\niPad mini (5th generation and later, including A17 Pro)\n\nWhat if I don't want to buy a new iPhone?\nIf you want to continue using your older iPhone that isn't supported by iOS 26, that's fine. However, you'll miss out on security updates which could potentially put your phone at risk for malware and other threats. Additionally, some apps may stop working if they require a certain version of iOS or later. And of course, you won't be able to access the latest features iOS 26 offers.\nWhen will iOS 26 become available?\nApple usually rolls out its latest iOS in mid-September, just a few days before the new iPhones hit store shelves. Last year, it released iOS 18 on Monday, Sept. 16. Expect a confirmation of the release date at the iPhone 17 event, expected in early September. \niOS 26 features we're excited about\nLiquid Glass design: Your home screen is getting revamped with new app icons, including dark mode and all-clear options. You'll also notice buttons with a new floating design. Liquid Glass was designed to make all of Apple's OSes more cohesive.\nPhone app redesign: You'll finally be able to scroll through contacts, recent calls and voicemail messages all on one screen. It also comes with a new feature called Hold Assist that'll notify you when an agent comes to the phone so you can avoid the elevator music.\nLive Translate: iOS 26 is bringing the ability to have a conversation via phone call or text message with someone who speaks another language. Live Translate will translate your conversation in real time. \nPolls feature: Coming to group messages in the Messages app, chat members will be able to create polls. This can help prevent the unwanted 30+ messages when it comes to deciding which restaurant you're meeting at this weekend.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/apples-new-ios-26-public-beta-4-is-here-but-is-your-iphone-compatible-check-this-list-191854764.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "The latest and greatest of the foldable phone world. (Google, Sam Rutherford/Engadget)\nLast month, the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 was released and immediately became the de facto king of the foldable phone hill. But now a new challenger has arrived: The Pixel 10 Pro Fold. The full details are now available in the wake of Google's splashy launch event, which debuted the Fold alongside the full new Pixel 10 line, a new Pixel smartwatch and two new earbuds, too (see everything Google announced). But the Pixel 10 Pro Fold was the star of the show, and it's vying with the Z Fold 7 for the title of best foldable — both offer very similar designs, but each bringing something unique to the table.\nSamsung launched its first foldable phone in 2019, so it's had quite a bit of time to refine the Galaxy Fold over the years. Google on the other hand just released its first Pixel Fold a couple years ago — but has already largely evened the match. And, of course, with enhanced Gemini AI software integration front and center, you'll have access to Google's impressive artificial intelligence features at nearly every turn.\nWe'll break down how the Pixel 10 Pro Fold and Galaxy Z Fold 7 stack up to one another. You can also check out our comparison of the Pixel 9 Pro Fold and the Galaxy Fold 6 to see how much has changed in a year. \nPrice\nFirst things first, how much will one of these high-tech folding phones cost you? That is the make-or-break question, after all. The newest Pixel foldable is still less expensive than this year's Z Fold: it starts at $1,799 while the Galaxy smartphone starts at $2,000.\nYou don't have any other real choices for \"book-style\" foldables in the US market. The OnePlus Open can be had for $1,499, but it's almost two years old. And Apple's most expensive phone is currently the $1,599 1TB iPhone 16 Pro Max — but as a non-foldable model with just a single screen, it's hardly a straight comparison. If the rumor mill is to be believed, Apple may finally bow a foldable iPhone in 2026.\nDimensions and display\nIt's a race for the largest display and Samsung won this time — but not by much. The Galaxy Z Fold is just a hair bigger than the Pixel Pro Fold. Both phones' inner displays are 8 inches across when fully opened, while Samsung comes out ahead on the outer display with 6.5 inches (the Pixel is 6.4 inches).\nAs for height, the new foldable Pixel phone is 6.1 inches and the Galaxy Z is 6.2 inches — not a huge difference there. When unfolded, the Samsung wins on size efficiency, packing the identically sized 8-inch internal display into an area that's 0.3 inches smaller — 5.6 inches versus the Pixel's 5.9.\nThis year, the Pixel 10 Pro Fold’s displays have been upgraded to a Super Actua Flex OLED display with ultra-thin glass. Both the front screen and back cover come equipped with Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2.\nAs for the Galaxy Z Fold 7, it has a Dynamic AMOLED display (inner and outer) and comes with the Corning Gorilla Glass Ceramic 2 on the front and the Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on the backside. The glass is ultra-thin, yet it's 50 percent thicker than before.\nWhile slightly bigger, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 is still lighter than the Pixel 10 Pro Fold. The Samsung model weighs only 7.6 ounces — down nearly an ounce from its 2024 model — while its Google competition comes in at 9.1 ounces (the same as last year's model).\nThe Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 (left) compared to the new Pixel 10 Pro Fold (right). (Sam Rutherford/Engadget)\nProcessor, RAM, storage and battery\nThe Pixel 10 Fold Pro runs the Tensor G5 chip — Google says its CPU features 34 percent better performance compared to the Tensor G4 chip.\nThe Z Fold 7 is powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy. \"Everything feels fast and snappy,\" Engadget's Sam Rutherford said of the Snapdragon 8 Elite performance on the Z Fold 7. (Sam also has first impressions of the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, but speed tests will happen a bit later.)\nBoth phones offer the choice of 256GB, 512GB or 1TB storage. On the RAM front, the Pixel Fold delivers 16GB across the line, while the Samsung model reserves that level for the top 1TB storage tier; the small models get 12GB instead. The Galaxy phone will cost you $2,419 if you decide you need the maximum amount of storage, whereas the Pixel Fold tops out at $2,149.\nWhen it comes to battery life, Samsung's foldable lasts up to 24 hours with a 4,400mAh battery. The Pixel lasts up to 30 hours thanks to a more capacious 5,015mAh battery rating. Furthermore, the Pixel Fold is certified for Qi2 wireless charging, which Google is branding as \"Pixelsnap\" across its 2025 Pixel line for the first time.\nCameras\nFor many shoppers, a phone is only as good as its cameras, and both of these phones bring a strong lens game. Each has three rear cameras, though they're different aesthetically. You'll notice the Pixel has a larger camera bump with two rows, while the Galaxy has a thinner vertical line of cameras.\nThe Pixel 10 Pro Fold's rear camera array consists of a 48MP wide sensor, a 10.5MP ultrawide and a 10.8MP telephoto with 5x optical zoom. All three offer \"Super Res Zoom\" up to 20x with optical and electronic image stabilization. Per our own Sam Rutherford, the potential drawback here is that Google played it safe: \"The biggest potential shortcoming of the P10PF is that its camera hardware is largely staying the same. Granted, that's not a huge deal because the previous model had the best photo quality of any foldable phone.\"\nBy comparison, the Samsung Galaxy Fold 7 rear camera trio includes the same 200MP wide-angle camera as the company's Galaxy S25 Ultra, but carries over the 12MP ultrawide and 10MP telephone from the Z Fold 6. Zoom levels are 3x optical and 30x digital.\nWhile we have yet to put the Pixel 10 Pro Fold cameras through their paces, Sam was still liking last year's Pixel Fold versus the Galaxy Z Fold 7 when he reviewed the latter: \"At night, the Fold 7's shots remained surprisingly sharp. I still prefer the Pixel 9 Pro Fold due to its more accurate white balance and often sharper focus, though Samsung's phone isn't far behind.\" And the entire Pixel line's cameras are (of course) supercharged with some new Google Gemini AI niceties, like the Camera Coach feature that enables voice-controlled photo editing. \nBoth the Pixel and Galaxy offer similar 10MP specs on their front and inner selfie cameras. \nColor options\nIf you like having multiple colors to choose from, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 is winning in this category. It comes in Mint, Jetblack, Blue Shadow and Silver Shadow. Mint is only available if you buy your phone online — you won't be seeing that one in stores.\nAs for the Pixel 10 Fold Pro, your options are Moonstone and Jade.\nFull specs comparison\nGoogle Pixel 10 Pro Fold\nSamsung Galaxy Z Fold 7\nStarting price\n$1,799\n$2,000\nDimensions\nFolded: 6.1 x 3.0 x 0.4 inches (155.2 x 76.3 x 10.8mm)Unfolded: 6.1 x 5.9 x 0.2 inches (155.2 x 150.4 x 5.2mm)\nFolded: 6.2 x 2.9 x 0.4 inches (158.4 x 72.8 x 8.9mm)Unfolded: 6.2 x 5.6 x 0.2 inches (158.4 x 143.2 x 4.2mm)\nWeight\n9.1 oz (258g)\n7.6 oz (215g)\nProcessor\nTensor G5\nSnapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy (3nm)\nDisplay\nInner: 8-inch Super ActuaOuter: 6.4-inch Actua\nInner: 8-inch Dynamic AMOLEDOuter: 6.5-inch Dynamic AMOLED\nStorage\n256GB / 512GB / 1TB\n256GB / 512GB / 1TB\nRAM\n16GB\n12GB (for 256GB, 512GB configs) | 16GB (for 1TB config)\nBattery\n5,015mAh | \"Up to 30 hours\"\n4,400mAh | \"Up to 24 hours\"\nCamera\nMain: 48MP wide (F1.7) | 10.5MP Ultrawide (F2.2) | 10.8MP Telephoto lens (F3.1) with 5x optical | Super Res Zoom up to 20xFront: 10MP (F2.2)Inner: 10 MP (F2.2)\nMain: 200MP Wide (F1.7) | 12MP Ultrawide (F2.2) | 10 MP (F2.4) Telephoto (F2.4) with 3x optical zoomFront: 10MP (F2.2)Inner: 10MP (F2.2)\nStylus support\nNo\nNo\nColors\nMoonstone, Jade\nMint (online only), Jetblack, Blue Shadow, Silver Shadow\n\nUpdated August 21, 2:26PM ET: Added a section comparing the cameras on both phones.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/google-pixel-10-pro-fold-vs-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-how-the-newest-foldable-phones-stack-up-165018793.html?src=rss",

Three weeks before the event, a leak showed “TechWoven” iPhone Pro 17 cases, featuring a higher quality woven material compared to the discontinued “FineWoven” line of fabric cases Apple released in 2023. This rumored device is said to have a profile thickness of 5.5 mm, making it about 0.08 inches thinner than current iPhones. The third generation of Apple Watch SE isn’t expected to receive major updates, aside from possibly a larger display.

Beyond Anthropic, researchers from OpenAI have independently embraced the idea of studying AI welfare. While the vast majority of users have healthy relationships with these AI chatbots, there are concerning outliers. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman says that less than 1% of ChatGPT users may have unhealthy relationships with the company’s product. In fact, it’s probably best to have multiple tracks of scientific inquiry.” Suleyman believes it’s not possible for subjective experiences or consciousness to naturally emerge from regular AI models.

The new capability, which is already available on TikTok, makes it easier for viewers to follow and discover related content. Now if a creator is telling a story in a series of videos and follow-ups, they can link them all together so that viewers don’t have to scroll or search for different parts. While the new feature is great for linking different parts of a saga, it could also be used to group together similar videos. For example, if a creator is doing a series where they’re baking a bunch of fall recipes, they can now group them all together so they’re easier to find. After a creator links reels together in a series, users will be able to navigate to the next reel using a new button located at the bottom left of the reel. Instagram says the new feature was highly requested and that it will allow for richer storytelling while also keeping audiences engaged longer, which could lead to increased watch time. The social network says it could also help turn casual viewers into followers. While the new feature isn’t a huge change, it’s a welcome addition for both creators and viewers, as it makes it easier to find and follow along with content on the platform.

    "summary": "Sony's WH-1000XM5 once topped our lists of best noise-canceling headphones and best wireless headphones, and were only usurped by the follow-up XM6. This line of headphones is consistently impressive and the WH-1000XM is truly in a league of its own. So we get excited when one of the all-around best headphones out there goes on an aggressive sale. You can pick up a pair of XM5s right now for just $274, which is 32 percent off its normal retail price of $400.\n \nIn our review of the XM5 we awarded a score of 95 out of 100, impressed with just about every aspect of the set with the notable exception of its price, which makes a sale like this all the more exciting. The XM5s are supremely comfortable, thanks to a slim cushioned headband and soft earcups. In our review, we had no problem wearing them for hours at a time and never felt uncomfortable pressure on the ears or head. \n30mm carbon-fiber drivers deliver excellent audio, delivering a wide and immersive soundstage. The XM5 carries eight total microphones as part of its active noise-canceling system, up from four on the previous model, and delivers top-of-class ANC.\nThe battery life on these headphones is best in class, with around 30 hours of listening per charge. Touch controls on the outside panel of the right ear cup help you control your music with ease, allowing you to play, pause, skip tracks and adjust the volume right from the headphones. The only real downside at this point is you’re buying a pair of headphones that are three years old; the XM6 offers some noteworthy improvements. But, of course, it’ll cost you.\nIf you've been thinking about upgrading your headphones, or picking up your first pair of real high-quality cans, then take advantage of these savings. The sale price of $274 applies to the black model only, though the other colors are 18 percent off, selling for $328.\nFollow @EngadgetDeals on X for the latest tech deals and buying advice.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/sonys-wh-1000xm5-headphones-are-32-percent-off-ahead-of-labor-day-143447083.html?src=rss",

This is just the latest update in the lengthy legal saga between Masimo and Apple, which started when the former sued the iPhonemaker in 2021, accusing it of infringing on several of its light-based blood oxygen monitoring patents. After a court sided with Masimo in 2023, Apple was forced to stop selling the Watch Series 9 and the Ultra 2 in the US for a few weeks. \nIn order to circumvent the import ban for the devices, Apple removed the Blood Oxygen app for the watch models sold in the US. Just a few days ago, however, the company introduced a \"redesigned Blood Oxygen feature\" for the Watch Series 9, Series 10 and Watch Ultra 2 models. The feature works by measuring and calculating data from the watches' sensors on their paired iPhones instead. Users will then be able to view their blood oxygen data in the Respiratory section of the Health app. \nApple said the update was \"enabled by a recent US Customs ruling.\" But Masimo said in its complaint (via Bloomberg Law) that it only heard about the ruling, which was handed down on August 1, when Apple made the announcement. It argued that the agency typically requires both sides to be heard before making such decisions and that Customs \"exceeded its authority.\" Masimo is now asking the court to put an injunction on UCBP's decision and, ultimately, to only allow imports of the devices if their blood oxygen-tracking function is disabled.\n\"Each passing day that this unlawful ruling remains in effect irreparably deprives Masimo of its right to be free from unfair trade practices and to preserve its competitive standing in the US marketplace,\" Masimo said.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wearables/masimo-files-lawsuit-over-apples-redesigned-blood-oxygen-monitoring-feature-130054895.html?src=rss",

The Insta360 GO Ultra is being billed as a new, more powerful product line in the GO series, instead of a replacement for the GO 3S.\nThis next generation represents a substantial step up in performance, powered by a new 5nm AI chip, which is a big jump from the 14nm chip found on the GO 3S. It also benefits from a larger 1/1.28-inch sensor, roughly twice the size of the one in the 3S. All of this unlocks better image quality with support for HDR, 4K capture at 60 fps and double the frame rate of the 3S. The Ultra also offers PureVideo, an enhancement that uses AI-powered algorithms to reduce noise and increase brightness in low-light captures.\nThe form factor for the Ultra is largely the same as the 3S, with a compact camera body that can be optionally housed in an Action Pod that offers additional battery life and a 2.5-inch flip touchscreen for live camera view. The Ultra weighs 53 grams (around 1.9 ounces), 14 grams more than the 3S, and sports a square body, as opposed to the pill-like shape of the 3S.\nThe slightly larger body means a 70-minute standalone battery life, which is just over 80 percent more than the 38 minutes on the 3S. The Action Pod extends this to 200 minutes. The Ultra also offers removable storage, expandable up to 2TB.\nLike most Insta360 cameras, much of the design is geared toward action shots for the more adventurous among us. The GO Ultra's IPX8 rating means it's waterproof down to 33 feet underwater. A magnetic clip system makes it easy to attach the GO Ultra to a piece of clothing or equipment and start capturing your adventure in 4K.\nThe Insta360 GO Ultra is available now worldwide for $450.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cameras/insta360-launches-new-action-camera-with-removable-storage-130019177.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Chinese regulators reportedly dissuaded local companies from purchasing NVIDIA's H20 chips, because they found certain statements by US commerce secretary Howard Lutnick \"insulting.\" According to the Financial Times, the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC), the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) and the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) teamed up to intensify their efforts to push the use of homegrown chips following Lutnick's remarks in an interview with CNBC. \nThe US, if you'll recall, blocked NVIDIA from selling its H20 chips to China back in April out of concern that the Chinese military would use them to develop AI technology. When the US government reversed its decision in July and allowed the company to start shipping its chips to China, Lutnick told CNBC: \"We don't sell them our best stuff, not our second best stuff, not even our third best. The fourth one down, we want to keep China using it... The idea is the Chinese are more than capable of building their own. You want to keep one step ahead of what they can build, so they keep buying our chips. You want to sell the Chinese enough that their developers get addicted to the American technology stack. That's the thinking.\" To note, a previous Times report stated that the government allowed NVIDIA to ship its products to China again after agreeing to hand over 15 percent of its profits.\nAs a response to Lutnick's remarks, the Times says Chinese authorities sought ways to prevent local companies from buying H20 chips. CAC issued an informal notice instructing China's biggest tech firms, such as ByteDance and Alibaba, to stop new orders for H20 chips until the government is done conducting a national security review. The companies are compelled to comply, because they could face substantial fines from the CAC if they don't. Meanwhile, NDRC also issued an informal notice, asking local tech companies not to purchase any NVIDIA chip. \nReuters recently reported that NVIDIA is developing a new chip for the Chinese market that's more powerful than the H20, perhaps driven in part by China's move to discourage its purchase. It will be based on the company's Blackwell architecture, but will only be capable of half the computing power of NVIDIA's Blackwell Ultra GPUs. Their regulatory and export approval aren't guaranteed, but the president previously implied that he was aware of the project and said he expects NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang to talk to him about it. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/china-reportedly-discouraged-purchase-of-nvidia-ai-chips-due-to-insulting-lutnick-statements-123055120.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "If you’ve been shocked by how much you spend on streaming services lately, you’re not alone. Companies like Netflix, Disney, Max and others have been consistently raising prices to the point where you may question if streaming is even worth it anymore. We at Engadget still think it is, but we also think you should be smart with your money — and that’s where streaming deals come in.\nYes, it is possible to get discounts on services like Peacock and Paramount+, even if those deals aren’t as common as a sale on AirPods. If you’re looking to save money and still stream all of the content you want, Engadget can help by laying out the best streaming deals you can get right now, how you can save with bundles and everything you should know before paying for yet another streaming service. \nBest streaming deals\nTrue streaming deals can be hard to come by. Most often, they’ll pop up during the Black Friday shopping period. On occasion, we’ll see them sparingly throughout the year and they usually take the form of a discounted monthly or annual rate for a limited period of time. Also, true streaming deals are typically on the ad-supported versions of a service, but once in a while you’ll find a unicorn of a deal on a tier that has ad-free viewing.\nIf you’re able to wait for a deal before subscribing to a streaming service, we recommend doing so. You’ll save money upfront and in the long run, and you also have the option to cancel your subscription before the price goes back up to the normal rate. Maybe you find you like the service so much that you’re fine paying full price for it — that’s the ideal situation. But if you’re not compelled to keep that app on rotation in your smart TV, most streaming services make it easy for you to cancel at any time. With that said, these are the best streaming deals you can snag right now.\n \nDirecTV starting at $50/month for one month ($35 off): All of DirecTV's signature packages are $35 off right now for your first month when you sign up. If you opt for the base \"Entertainment\" package, you'll spend $50 for the first month and get access to over 90 channels, including many local stations as well as ESPN, ESPN 2 and Fox Sports 1. You'll also be able to watch on the go with the DirecTV mobile app.\nDashPass Annual + HBO Max (with ads) for $96/year ($144 off): This offer includes access to HBO Max with ads for no extra cost when you sign up for a DashPass Annual plan. You can then decide to upgrade to Max Standard, which removes ads, for a discounted rate of $11 monthly if you want. Aside from the obvious streaming benefits, this deal gives you $0 deliver fees and lower service fees on some restaurant DoorDash orders, five percent DoorDash credits on pickup orders, on-demand grocery delivery and other members-only exclusives.\nSpotify Premium Individual (3 month) for $0 ($36 off): This is our favorite music streaming service for podcasts and social features. Right now, users who have not signed up for Spotify's Premium service before are eligible to get three months for free. The Premium Individual plan lets you listen ad-free and skip songs at will. You can also organize your listening queue and download content for offline listening. Just be aware, your subscription will auto-renew at the end of the trial period. So if you don't want to be on the hook for the $12 monthly fee, set a reminder to cancel and go back to the free version.\nFubo Pro for $55/month for the first month ($30 off): Fubo has introductory discounts on most of its packages, and the Pro package is the least expensive plan currently listed. It offers access to 224 channels, unlimited cloud DVR and up to 10 simultaneous streams. It even includes regional sports content from the NHL, MLB and NBA.\nYouTube TV (three months) for $150 ($99 off): You can get three months of our favorite live TV streaming service for $50 per month. That should give you a decent chunk of time to see if the service is right for you while saving some cash. The discount and trial are only open to new subscribers to YouTube TV’s base plan, which includes access to over 100 channels, unlimited DVR space and six household accounts with the ability to stream on three devices at once. \nSling Orange for $23/month for the first month (50 percent off): New customers can get Sling Orange or Sling Blue for half off the usual price for the first month, bringing the final prices to $23/month and $25.50/month, respectively. Orange is likely best for sports fans, with eight exclusive sports and family channels, while Blue includes 19 exclusive news and entertainment channels. You can get both Orange and Blue access also for half off for one month, or $33 total.\nPeacock first responders discount — one year for $48 (50 percent off): Medical professionals and first responders can save 50 percent each year of Peacock. The deal requires annual verification and is open to those who work for either private or public institutions. Peacock has some great stuff to watch, including Poker Face and Killing It and more.\nStudent discounts on streaming services\nHBO Max student discount — subscribe for $5/month (50 percent off): HBO Max offers their ad-supported tier to students for half off the usual rate. You’ll just have to verify that you’re a student through Unidays, and make note that this offer is only good for up to 12 months of service.\nHulu student discount — subscribe for $2/month (75 percent off): Those with a valid student ID can get Hulu’s ad-supported tier for 75 percent off the typical rate. They’ll keep the same sale price for as long as they’re a student as well.\nSpotify student discount — Premium + Hulu with ads for $6/month (72 percent off): Spotify’s student offer continues to be one of the best around, giving you access to the Premium tier of the music streamer and Hulu’s ad-supported plan for only $6 monthly. Purchased separately, you’d pay $22 per month for both of the services. Plus, the first month is free when you sign up.\nNBA League Pass student discount — one year for $120 (40 percent off): Students can get one year of League Pass for only $10 per month, which includes access to NBA TV and the ability to watch classic and archive games on-demand. On the NBA League Pass website, look for the student discount banner at the top and follow the instructions to verify your student status.\nStreaming bundle discounts\nThere’s more consolidation happening now than ever before in the streaming space, and that means there are more streaming bundle options. These bundles offer you access to more content with one subscription price, but those prices are typically higher than paying for a single service by itself (obviously). It may be tempting to just get the bundle, but if only one of those services in the bundle speaks to you, you’ll spend less overall by just paying for the single service.\nSpeaking of a deep love for a single streaming service: if all of your favorite shows are on Peacock or the latest releases on HBO Max consistently bring you joy, consider paying for one year upfront. Subscribing with an annual plan usually saves you money in the long term over paying on a monthly basis. Unfortunately, not all streaming services (looking at you, Netflix) have an annual subscription option. Here are some of the best streaming bundles you can get right now.\n \nDisney+, Hulu, HBO Max bundle with ads for $17/month: Ad-supported HBO Max is included here, along with full, ad-supported access to Disney+ and Hulu. You’ll save 43 percent with this bundle, as opposed to paying for all three services individually.\nDisney+ and Hulu Bundle Premium for $20/month: Disney and Hulu offer a few different bundles, which you can view in the drop-down lists under Choose Your Plan. This bundle removes the ads from both Disney+ and Hulu (with the exception of select live and linear content) and allows you to download content for offline viewing. You’ll save 42 percent with this bundle, as opposed to paying for both ad-free tiers individually.\nHulu + Live TV with Disney+ and ESPN+ for $96/month: This streaming bundle amalgamation is a bit confusing but it does offer a lot: you get live TV streaming via Hulu’s service plus access to the following VOD services: Hulu, Disney+ and ESPN+. Out of those three, only ESPN+ will have ads.\nDisney+, Hulu, ESPN+ Bundle Basic for $17/month: You get full access to Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+ content with this package, albeit with ads across the board. This bundle price is 46 percent off the total price of all three separate subscriptions.\nDisney+, Hulu, ESPN+ Bundle Premium for $27/month: Similarly to the Duo bundles, the Premium version of the Trio removes ads from most content in Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+, and you can download content for offline viewing. This price represents a 43-percent savings when compared to paying for all three ad-free tiers separately.\nSling TV + HBO Max starting at $53/month: Sling TV and HBO Max have partnered on a discount that gives new subscribers 50 percent off their first month of Sling TV, plus $5 off monthly when you subscribe to the Sling TV + HBO Max bundle. The standard price for the Sling Blue + HBO Max duo is roughly $58/month, so you'll get a monthly discount of $5 off that. In addition, for the first month only, you'll get half off the price of the bundle. The promotion also applies to the Sling Orange & Blue + HBO Max package, which has a standard price of $73/month.\nParamount+ with Showtime for $13/month or $120/year: This includes everything in Paramount+’s Essential plan, except the ads, and also provides access to Showtime content, live CBS streams and download features.\nRead more streaming coverage\n\nThe best live TV streaming services to cut cable\nThe best streaming services: Netflix, Hulu, HBO Max and more\nThe best streaming devices\n\nFollow @EngadgetDeals on X for the latest tech deals and buying advice.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/best-streaming-service-deals-133028980.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "In-flight internet is crappy, but more and more airlines think that Starlink is the solution. The latest company to sign with the SpaceX affiliate is Alaska Air Group, which announced that it will start offering Starlink Wi-Fi next year and expand the service to its entire fleet by 2027. \"With Starlink already live on [Alaska Air Group subsidiary] Hawaiian Airlines, we're proud that we'll offer... gate-to-gate connectivity on nearly every aircraft across both airlines,\" CEO Ben Minicucci said in a statement. \nThe company noted in a separate announcement that it will offer the perk for free to members of its new loyalty program called Atmos Rewards. T-Mobile, a partner with Alaska, will also offer a \"seamless, ad-free Wi-Fi log-on\" to the in-flight Starlink service, with more details to be announced later this year. Alaska Air touted the benefits of \"ultra-fast speeds... up to 7x faster than the geostationary satellite-based Wi-Fi systems that most airlines use today.\" \nOther airlines may jump on board soon, too. British Airways is also on the verge of announcing a Starlink deal, Bloomberg reported, and SpaceX has also reportedly been in conversation with Dubai's Emirates. Both of those are flagship carriers in their respective nations, so winning the business would be a large coup for Starlink against legacy operators like Viasat and Echostar. \nSwitching to Starlink isn't necessarily cheap, though. It reportedly costs around $300,000 to equip a 737 and around half a million to install the system on a 787 Dreamliner. On top of that, airlines pay around $120 monthly per seat, plus another $120 for live TV, according to Bloomberg's sources. (None of the airlines in negotiations have confirmed any details.)\nDespite those costs, carriers see reliable in-flight internet as a potential game-changer, as it would allow customers to work, communicate and stream videos or live TV. If the latter can be done reliably, it might even allow airlines to get rid of heavy and expensive on-demand entertainment systems. \nThe main downside for potential customers is SpaceX's owner, Elon Musk. Some may view his fractured relationship with US president Donald Trump as a negative, while end-users may be turned off by his political affiliations — something that has seemingly affected sales of his Tesla EVs of late. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/alaska-air-will-offer-starlink-in-flight-internet-starting-next-year-120023852.html?src=rss",

Switching to Starlink isn't necessarily cheap, though. (None of the airlines in negotiations have confirmed any details.) If the latter can be done reliably, it might even allow airlines to get rid of heavy and expensive on-demand entertainment systems. The main downside for potential customers is SpaceX's owner, Elon Musk."

    "summary": "Apple’s next big to-do for 2025 will be the upcoming iPhone 17 event, which will likely happen some time in September. Historically, the company uses those events to announce new iPhones, AirPods and Apple Watches — MacBooks tend to get their own, separate shindig (though we do expect the new macOS 26 software to come out around that time). For now, the most recent MacBooks are the M4 MacBook Air and the M4 MacBook Pro. Deciding between just two models may seem easy, but there are still plenty of variables to consider before you add one to your cart — screen size, chip capabilities, price and memory configurations will all come into play. We’ve reviewed every MacBook model to come out in the last 17 years or so, so we compiled this guide to help you pick the best MacBook for you.\nTable of contents\n\nBest MacBooks for 2025\nWhat about budget MacBooks?\nFactors to consider when buying a MacBook\nMacBooks specs comparison chart\nBest MacBook FAQs\n\nBest MacBooks for 2025\n \n \nWhat about budget MacBooks?\nHistorically, Apple kept the previous year’s MacBook Air in its lineup as a sort of budget option. But the company took a different approach with the release of the M4 MacBook Air. Instead of continuing to sell the older model, Apple discontinued the M3 Air and gave its newest computer a $100 price cut. \nNow, if you can even find a brand new M3 MacBook Air (typically from retailers like Amazon or B&H), it’s often more expensive than the M4 version. During sales like Amazon Prime Day, we’ve seen the newest M4 Air go for as little as $799. That effectively makes our overall pick a budget pick as well.\nOf course, $800 isn’t exactly a small investment either for college students or others on a budget. Especially when you can find some decent PCs for under $500. If you’re looking to save even more on a MacBook, we recommend checking out refurbished options directly from Apple, or even third party sellers like BackMarket. There are a few guidelines to keep in mind, which we go over in our refurbished guide, but mainly, you’ll want to shop from a reputable source that has a stated process and offers at least a year-long warranty. Using your old gear as a trade-in will bring down your final cost as well.\nFactors to consider when buying a MacBook\nCompared to PCs, Apple computers tend to have more streamlined specifications. The company has long been known for this simplicity, and the M-series “system-on-a-chip” condenses things even further. Prior to the M1 chip, Apple used Intel chips in its laptop and desktop computers. The M2 and M3 generations followed that first chip and currently sells MacBooks equipped with M4-series chips. You’ll find the standard M4 processor in the Air and the base-model Pro and the upgraded M4 Max and M4 Pro chips as options for the MacBook Pro (currently there is no M4 Ultra chip, as there was with the M3 series in the Mac Studio). All M-series chips combine, among other technologies, the CPU, graphics card and unified memory (RAM). Apple’s Neural Engine is included too, which is a specialized group of processor cores that handles machine learning tasks such as image analysis and voice recognition.\nWhile a unified chip means you have fewer decisions to make when picking a MacBook, there are still a few factors to consider, including specs like the number of CPU cores, amount of RAM, storage capacity, screen size, and, obviously, price. The finish color may be a minor consideration, but it's worth pointing out that the Pro comes in just two colors (Silver or Space Black) but the Air comes in four hues (Midnight, Starlight, Sky Blue and Silver).\nCPU cores\nThe lowest-specced chip in a current-lineup MacBook is the standard M4 chip, which is found in all models of the MacBook Air and the base model MacBook Pro 14-inch. That chip houses a 10-core CPU and either an 8- or 10-core GPU. In total, there are three versions of the M4 chip: standard M4, M4 Pro and M4 Max (which are each a step up from their predecessors, the M3, M3 Pro and M3 Max chips). The burliest chip, the M4 Max is built with either a 14- or 16-core CPU and a 32- or 40-core GPU. \nCores are, in essence, smaller processing units that can handle different tasks simultaneously. Having more of them translates to the computer being able to run multiple programs and applications at once, while also smoothly processing demanding tasks like video and photo editing and high-level gaming. In short, more cores allow for more advanced computing and better performance. But if your processing power needs fall below professional-level gaming and cinematic video and audio editing, getting the highest number of cores is likely overkill — and after all, more cores equals higher cost and more power usage.\n\n\n\n\n   Photo by Devindra Hardawar/Engadget \n \n\nRAM\nYour options for RAM, or in Apple’s terminology, unified memory, varies, but with the switch to the M4 chip in all laptops, the lowest amount of RAM you can get is now 16GB. That’s a necessary spec-bump to accommodate the tech world’s favorite feature of the moment: AI or, in this case, Apple Intelligence (still AI, but Cupertino’s version). The M4 Pro chip has 24 or 48GB memory options, while the M4 Max chip supports 48, 64 or a whopping 128GB of RAM.\nYou’ve likely heard the analogy comparing memory to the amount of workspace available on a literal desktop surface, whereas storage is the amount of drawers you have to store projects to work on later. The larger the worktop surface, the more projects you can work on at once. The bigger the drawers, the more you can save for later.\nIn addition to supporting Apple Intelligence, more RAM is ideal for people who plan to work in multiple apps at once. And the more demanding each program is, the more RAM will be required. Extra memory can also come in handy if you’re the type who likes to have infinite numbers of tabs open on your browser. If your daily workflow doesn’t involve simultaneously using a vast number of memory-intensive programs, you can save yourself money and buy the RAM configuration that you’re most likely to actually use.\nFor a long time, Apple continued to offer MacBooks with just 8GB of RAM, and we recommended upgrading to at least 16GB of RAM. With this being the standard today, grabbing a base model should be fine for most non-pro-level users. One thing to note is that, unlike most PCs, the RAM in a MacBook is not user-upgradable since it’s tied into the system-on-a-chip. If you think you might end up needing more memory, you should go for the spec upgrade up front.\nStorage capacity (SSD)\nStorage options range from 256GB of SSD for the base-model MacBook Air and 8TB of storage for the MacBook Pros with the M4 Max chip. If you want to rotate between a long roster of game titles or keep lots of high-res videos on hand, you’ll want more storage. If you’re mostly working with browser- and cloud-based applications, you can get away with a smaller-capacity configuration. That said, we recommend springing for 512GB of storage or more, if it’s within your budget. You’ll quickly feel the limits of a 256GB machine as it ages since the operating system alone takes up a good portion of that space. Having 1TB will feel even roomier and allow for more data storage over the life of your laptop.\nWhen Apple announced the iPhone 15, the company also announced new iCloud+ storage storage plans, with subscriptions that allow up to 12TB of storage shared among your iOS and MacOS devices. You could also transfer files to an external storage device. But if you don’t want to pay for a monthly subscription and prefer the convenience of having immediate access to your files, it’s best to get the highest amount of storage space your budget allows for at the outset.\nScreen size\nThe MacBook Air comes in 13- or 15-inch sizes. Pro models have either 14- or 16-inch screens. A two-inch delta may not seem like much but, as Engadget’s Nathan Ingraham noted when he reviewed the then-new 15-inch M2-powered MacBook Air, a larger screen \"makes a surprising difference.” That’s especially true if you plan to use your laptop as an all-day productivity machine and won’t be using an external monitor. More space means you can more clearly view side-by-side windows and have a more immersive experience when watching shows or gaming.\nBut screen size is one of the main factors influencing weight. The 13-inch MacBook Air M4 weighs 2.7 pounds, whereas the top-end 16-inch MacBook Pro with the Max chip weighs 4.7 pounds. If you plan to travel a lot or swap your work locations regularly, a smaller screen will make life easier in the long run.\nAll MacBooks feature IPS LCD panels (in-plane switching, liquid crystal display), which Apple markets as Retina displays. The MacBook Air M4 has a Liquid Retina display and the Pro models have Liquid Retina XDR displays. “Liquid” refers to the way the lighted portion of the display “flows” within the contours of the screen, filling the rounded corners and curving around the camera notch. “XDR” is what Apple calls HDR (high dynamic range).\nYou also get the option of a standard or nano-texture display on the MacBook Pro. The glass, which reduces glare and is also available on the Studio Display, iMac and iPad Pro, comes with a $150 price increase, but if you really don’t like reflections on your screen, it could be worth it.\nCompared to most other laptops, MacBook displays are notably bright, sharp and lush. But one feature worth pointing out is another Apple marketing term: ProMotion. It’s the company’s term to describe a screen with a higher, 120Hz refresh rate, which results in smoother scrolling and more fluid-looking graphics. Only MacBook Pros offer ProMotion; the Air maxes out at 60Hz, which is perfectly fine for everyday browsing and typical workdays. But if you want buttery-smooth motion from your display, you’ll have to shell out more money for an upgrade.\nOperating systems\nSoftware considerations won’t make much of a difference when deciding between MacBook models — all come with macOS installed. But if you’re switching from, say, a Windows PC, the operating system may be something to factor into your decision — though it’s probably less of an issue than it once was. Now that so much of the work we do on our computers is browser- and cloud-based, the learning curve between the two platforms isn’t as steep. Apps and programs like Gmail perform similarly regardless of what computer you’re using. Apple machines have historically had more limited support of AAA gaming titles, but even that is changing with more AAA games and better graphics coming to Macs.\nAs for macOS, it’s getting better too. With macOS Tahoe 26, the Spotlight function is more advanced, making it easier to find apps and perform tasks straight from your keyboard. The software also implements Apple's unifying Liquid Glass design for a modern look that looks consistent across iOS and iPad devices. New enhanced iPhone continuity features also make MacBooks and the handset work better together. A revamped Shortcuts app is more powerful as well, giving users custom automations that leverage Apple Intelligence (the company’s own AI).\nPrice\nWhen Apple announced the MacBook Air M4, it also delivered a bit of refreshing news: The latest model now starts $100 cheaper than the previous generation. So now, the least expensive MacBook is the 13-inch, M4-powered Air with 16GB of RAM and 256GB of storage for $999. Alternatively, you can spend up to $7,349 for the 16-inch MacBook Pro M4 Max with the nano-texture glass, 128GB of RAM and 8TB of storage. \nChip type, screen size, memory and storage capacity all influence the final price, which is why guides like this can help you determine just what you need (and what you don’t) so you can get the most cost-effective machine for you. AppleCare is another cost to consider. The extended warranty plan from Apple covers repairs from accidents and offers free battery replacement and starts at $3.50 per month or $35 per year for MacBooks. \nWe recommend the MacBook Air M4 for most people, and thanks to that $100 price cut, it’s also a good budget option. If you want something even cheaper, we recommend looking at refurbished M-series models from Apple. We think the 14- or 16-inch MacBook Pros are best for professionals. If you have extra money to spare once you’ve picked your machine, we recommend upgrading to at least 512GB of storage to make your machine as future-proof as possible. Of course, if you're just after the M4 chip and want the cheapest route to get it, you might consider the M4 Mac mini, which starts at $599 (though you'll have to supply the screen, mouse and keyboard).  \nBest MacBooks spec comparison chart\n\n\n\nProduct \nSuperlative \nTested configuration \nTested battery life \nRated battery life \n\n\nApple MacBook Air M4 (13-inch) \nBest MacBook overall \nApple M4, 16GB RAM, 256GB SSD \n18.25 hours \nUp to 18 hours \n\n\nApple MacBook Pro M4 (14-inch) \nBest MacBook for creatives \nApple M4, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD \n34.25 hours \nUp to 22 hours \n\n\n\nBest MacBook FAQs\nWhat's the difference between MacBook Air and Pro?\nBoth the MacBook Air and Pro models come with the M4 chip. MBP models have the option of more powerful M4 Pro or M4 Max chips. The Pro has a higher resolution screen with a higher peak brightness that supports up to 120Hz adaptive refresh rates and XDR (extreme dynamic range). The battery life on most Pro models is longer than on the Air models as well. Pro models also have more ports and more speakers. In short, the MacBook Air is aimed at everyday users looking for good productivity and entertainment capabilities, while Pro models are aimed at professionals who need a high-performance computer.\nWhat's the difference between macOS and Windows?\nMacOS is the operating system developed by Apple and used in all of its desktop and laptop computers. It can only be found in hardware made by Apple including MacBooks and iMacs. Microsoft’s Windows operating system can be found in the company’s own Surface laptops as well as computers made by a wide array of manufacturers, like Acer, Asus, Dell and Razer.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/best-macbook-140032524.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "With August already two-thirds out the door, it means we're getting closer to the Apple iPhone event, which typically takes place in September. During that event, we'll finally get to put our eyes on the iPhone 17 lineup. The latest iOS 26 features will come preinstalled on the new models, as well as any additional features Apple reveals at the launch event. But since we still have to wait a few weeks (presumably) until the iPhone event, we can at least speculate what the new phones will look like. As with most unreleased iPhone models, rumors and leaks have trickled in about the hardware side ahead of the official introduction. Here's what we're expecting and what we can reasonably assume we'll get from Cupertino in September.\nWhat are the latest iPhone 17 rumors?\nCould new \"TechWoven\" cases be introduced with the latest iPhone 17 lineup? That's what leaker Majin Bu claims, per a MacRumors report. The cases match the rumored design on the iPhone 17 models, with the wide camera bump. MacRumors says this could be a revamped version of the much-maligned FineWoven case, which was discontinued due to being susceptible to scratches and stains.\nHere are the new TechWoven Cases for iPhone 17Full Article: https://t.co/UGMdYQWPJX pic.twitter.com/BftqiD03jO— Majin Bu (@MajinBuOfficial) August 20, 2025\n\nThe leaker noted there are two lanyard holes for \"convenient and secure carrying,\" so it could be worn around your neck.\nThis is just a rumor and we won't know what the actual iPhone 17 models or accessories will look like until Apple's iPhone event next month. That said, the shared photos (including the one embedded above) are more convincing than usual.\nHow much will the iPhone 17 cost?\nApple's announced plan to expand US-based manufacturing partners seems to give it at least some shielding from the steepest Trump administration tariffs that have already triggered price increases on everything from Switch consoles to high-end cameras to Sonos speakers. But given that President Trump's trade policies can change from week to week, and Apple's continuing reliance on Asia-based supply chains, price shocks remain an ongoing possibility. The bigger question is: Will Apple absorb any higher costs, or pass them on to consumers? \nIf prices do creep up, Apple may choose to pair it with an \"upgrade.\" Consider this recent rumor posted by MacRumors from a leaker known as \"Instant Digital,\" suggesting that the default storage of the iPhone 17 line may start at 256GB, doubling the current 128GB baseline. While that could be accompanied by a price increase of $50, Apple could at least pitch it as a \"better value.\" That said, the company doubled the default RAM of its Mac computers from 8GB to 16GB at no extra cost in 2024 — but that was before the current Trump tariff cycle started.\nWhen will the iPhone 17 series be announced?\nMost years, the flagship smartphones are introduced in September. MacRumors highlighted a story originally reported by iphone-ticker.de that the Apple iPhone 17 event could be Tuesday, September 9, according to information gleaned from German mobile phone providers.\nIt's still too early to have the specific dates; some years, Apple only gives a week or two of lead time between sending invites and hosting the event. But years of past precedent show that sometime in September should be when the 17 models make their debut. This family of smartphones may be the last to follow that trend, however. There have been hints that the introduction of the iPhone 18 collection in 2026 will be split into a pro-tier announcement in the fall and a standard model announcement the following spring.\nWhat will the new iPhone 17 lineup include?\nDesign leaks suggest that Apple is building an ultra-thin smartphone, likely to be named the iPhone 17 Air to match Apple's ultralight laptop designation. Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, often a solid source of advanced intel about Apple, reported in January that the iPhone 17 Air will be equipped with a basic A19 chip and will only have a single camera lens. It may also use Apple's new in-house modem, which was introduced in February on the iPhone 16e. More details about this development may leak ahead of September, but that's what we know for now.\nAn investor note from Apple analyst Jeff Pu indicated that the Air will have a titanium frame. If his reports are accurate, the lightweight smartphone will be the only entry in the iPhone 17 lineup to use that metal; the iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone 17 Pro Max are expected to be made of aluminum, which is oddly a lighter material than titanium. Other speculation had suggested that the Air would use a blend of aluminum and titanium, so the exact materials may not be known until the official announcement.\nAdditionally, an August 4 MacRumors report says the internal battery pack of the iPhone Air is just 2.49mm thick — half the thickness of the iPhone 17 Pro battery. The leak was posted on the Korean-language Naver blog, where they show the alleged batteries of the iPhone 17 Air and 17 Pro side by side. The same account claimed the 17 Air's battery capacity was a mere 2,800 mAh, MacRumors notes. (That's below the battery capacity of current iPhone 16 models.)\nOn a similar topic, an iPhone 17 Pro production leak appears to have revealed an all-aluminum chassis, according to MacRumors. Originally posted by leaker Majin Bu, the image shows a shell that has a large round hole on the back (where the Apple logo typically is) to allow for MagSafe charging. MacRumors says this could just be a molding but notes that the aluminum frame (versus the current titanium in Pro iPhone models) would yield a significantly lower weight.\nThat same leaker (Majin Bu), whom MacRumors classifies as a \"hit-or-miss leaker,\" suggests the iPhone 17 Pro will have better wireless signal strength thanks to an updated antenna design. The individual posted a render on X that shows a new antenna system that wraps around the iPhone 17 Pro's supposedly wider rear camera bump. Again, this is a render, not a real-world photo. That said, we can't knock the goal of better wireless reception, so we're hoping this one has a degree of truth to it.\nEach new roster includes a base model, but over the years, Apple has shaken up the variety of phones it offers. Most likely there will be an iPhone 17 and an iPhone 17 Pro. Apple has also committed to the size matters philosophy, and has been building an iPhone Pro Max option with an even bigger screen and better battery life; the 17 roster will almost certainly have one as well. \nThe new Pro iPhones are said to have a full-width \"camera island\" on the rear, which would mark the first time an Apple model opted for that design. This feature can be seen in the purported iPhone 17 \"spotted in the wild.\" The pics, highlighted on MacRumors, show a black cased iPhone (17 Pro?) with the distinct back panel. Is it the real deal? The dual angles lend a degree of credibility in a social media landscape increasingly polluted with AI-enhanced fakes, but your guess is as good as ours.\nI just spotted a test development iPhone in the wild 🤩🤩🤩 pic.twitter.com/iS3PtKWqxJ— Fox Pupy 🦊🧡 (@Skyfops) July 28, 2025\n\nThe iPhone 17 Air seems primed to take the place of a potential iPhone 17 Plus. Since the iPhone 16e was only just introduced in February at a surprisingly high price point, it seems unlikely that there will be a new addition to that lower end of the spectrum, the models that were previously called SE. \nAt the very least, it sounds like the iPhone 17 Air won't take away the charging port and rely only on wireless connectivity. Bloomberg said that while Apple had investigated making the iPhone 17 Air without a single port, the company (fortunately) changed plans. He also says that the rumored phone will have a 6.6-inch screen and include the Dynamic Island and Camera Control button. Finally, the price is rumored at $900 — likely more than the standard iPhone 17 but less than the Pro.\nWe've also gotten what seems to be a reliable look at what the color lineup will be for the new smartphones. Macworld reported that the iPhone 17 will be available in black, white, steel gray, green, purple and light blue. The iPhone 17 Air will reportedly have four color options: black, white, light blue and light gold. While the Air colors will be less saturated, the visuals for the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max will go bold. The options for the Pro models are expected to be black, white, gray, dark blue and orange.\nOn July 30, Tom's Guide highlighted an X post from Sonny Dickson — a longtime and generally reliable leaker of unreleased iPhone information — showing \"dummy\" iPhone 17 models in the new colors that were the source of the aforementioned Macworld story. While these are literally just mock-ups — not real, leaked iPhones — it's interesting to see how the design and color rumors translate into a real-world look and feel.\nTo add the the rumors, a Weibo leaker known as Digital Chat Station suggests the iPhone 17e will come equipped with a new design that includes the Dynamic Island, MacRumors reports. According to the post, the new phone will have the A19 chip and could have a 6.1-inch OLED display with a front-facing 12-megapixel camera and a rear-facing 48-megapixel camera. However, it's important to note this report refers to the 17e model that would be expected to launch no earlier than February 2026, if it followed the same release pattern as the iPhone 16e.\nWhat will iOS 26 be like?\nApple upended its numbering conventions with WWDC 2025, and will match the name of each new operating system to the year it's released. So when the next wave of iPhones hits, they'll be running on iOS 26.\nOn the design side, the smartphone OS introduced during the big developer showcase took a contentious approach dubbed Liquid Glass. Apple has been scaling down the amount of transparency effects in the subsequent beta tests of iOS 26, but it will still have a glass-like visual.\nThe feature list includes big and small updates. On the more impactful side, the Phone and Photos apps have been redesigned. There will be several features leveraging artificial intelligence, such as live translation capabilities coming to Phone, FaceTime and Messages. Apple is also currently testing a sensitive content warning for child accounts that will freeze FaceTime video if nudity is detected by on-device machine learning tools. And the company is also launching Visual Intelligence, which will use AI to search for elements in an image.\niOS 26 also has a litany of minor, quality of life improvements. Group texts are getting support for polls. And for the slow risers out there, iOS 26 will finally let you escape the tyranny of the nine minute snooze alarm. \nThe next iOS is now available as a public beta. Here are our initial impressions of the Liquid Glass design and other new features. iOS 26 is compatible with all models back through iPhone 11.\nWhat other products are expected to be released alongside the iPhone 17?\nIf Apple follows its usual pattern, the iPhone 17 will be announced alongside new Apple Watch products. That would be the Apple Watch Series 11 (if Apple sticks to the same naming scheme), and maybe an Apple Watch Ultra 3 and/or an updated Apple Watch SE. (They'll all run watchOS 26, of course.) Other possibilities — and this is, again, speculation — could include refreshed Apple AirPods Pro (which received its last big update in 2022) and maybe new AirTags trackers (first released in 2021).\nThe Apple rumor mill got a big shot in the arm this week thanks to the reported inclusion of product ID numbers in recent beta software builds. Per MacRumors, it's a laundry list of new hardware, including long-rumored product updates like the Apple TV, HomePod mini, new Apple Studio Display monitor and two fresh iPads. \nOf course, even if that list is totally accurate, we may not see those products until 2026 — if ever. So don't expect all of products to share the stage with the iPhone 17, especially since Apple likes to keep its star performer at the center of attention. \nThat said, keep in mind that Apple has recently been having Mac-centric announcements in late October (as it did last year to debut new M4 Macs), so there's always the chance of another shoe dropping a few weeks down the road.  \nUpdate, August 20, 2025, 7:12PM ET: Added new rumor about potential TechWoven case for iPhone 17 series.\nUpdate, August 18, 2025, 6:23PM ET: Added new rumor about the iPhone 17e potentially having the Dynamic Island.\nUpdate, August 15, 2025, 2:05PM ET: Added new rumor about the all-aluminum chassis on the iPhone 17.\nUpdate, August 13, 2025, 10:02PM ET: Added a list of the products that are expected to be released alongside the iPhone 17s. \nUpdate, August 11, 2025, 7:27PM ET: Added a render of a rumored new antenna design for the iPhone 17 Pro.\nUpdate, August 8, 2025, 4:43PM ET: Added new speculation and reports about iPhone 17 pricing.\nUpdate, August 6, 2025, 4:05PM ET: Added latest details about the potential iPhone 17 event date.\nUpdate, August 4, 2025, 5:23PM ET: Added latest battery leaks about the iPhone 17 models.\nUpdate, August 1, 2025, 8:15AM ET: Added new photos showing potential iPhone 17 colors.\nUpdate, July 30, 2025, 11:08AM ET: Added latest leaks and rumors about the iPhone 17, and updated information on the iOS 26 public beta.\nUpdate, July 17, 2025, 4:40PM ET: Added latest information about iOS 26, possible materials for the Air, and the color options for the different models.\nUpdate, March 17, 2025, 2PM ET: Added details about the rumored price and features of the iPhone 17 Air.\nUpdate, April 11, 2025, 3:45PM ET: Added details from Front Page Tech's new video that claims to reveal details from a leaked iOS 19 build.\nKatie Teague contributed to this story.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/apple-iphone-17-launch-date-is-rumored-for-september-everything-to-know-about-the-newest-lineup-153024220.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Liquid Glass is a huge new change coming to iOS 26. (Apple)\nIn just few weeks, Apple's annual iPhone event will likely be upon us, which means we'll finally get a look at the newest iPhone 17 lineup. In addition, the company will also give us an official date for downloading iOS 26. Until that happens, you can download and install the newly released public beta 4 (or iOS 26 developer beta 7 for developers). I've been playing around with it for the past couple of weeks, and have found that taking screenshots is way better in the new operating system — Google and ChatGPT search options are now in the screenshots editor, for instance. You can see a more complete view of the new features in our preview of the iOS 26 public beta release, which shows off the fresh home and lock screen redesign. Called Liquid Glass, the new translucent look will extend across all of Apple's upcoming operating systems. The overhaul is one of several big changes coming to iOS, macOS, iPadOS and the rest of Apple's software suite, all of which were showcased during the company's WWDC keynote on June 9.\nAfter overpromising on AI plans last year, Apple kept its iOS roadmap focused more on basic quality of life improvements this year. There are multiple useful additions coming to the Phone and Messages apps on your iPhone, for instance: Apple execs outlined the ability to weed out spam texts or other unknown senders and an option to hold your spot on a phone call when you've been waiting for a representative to pick up. Plus, a treasured feature that we took for granted is coming back (hint: it's in the Photos app).\nSiri, meanwhile, is in a holding pattern. Apple has previously specified that its smarter voice assistant — first promised at WWDC 2024 — is delayed until some point \"in the coming year,\" so you shouldn't expect any major changes in the current betas. But there are reports that Apple is aiming to give Siri a bigger brain transplant by basing it on third-party artificial intelligence models like OpenAI's ChatGPT or Anthropic's Claude, which could make 2026 a pivotal year. The company is also reportedly working on a 'stripped-down' AI chatbot to rival ChatGPT.\nWith each beta, it seems like additional new improvements are popping up, like this new AirPods gesture we're all curious about, and this FaceTime feature that'll freeze your video if it detects nudity. With the release of the iOS 26 developer beta 5, we saw more added features, like a new bouncy animation on the passcode screen and in the Control Center, MacRumors reports. Some or all of those changes will likely soon migrate into the separate public beta (see below). Most newer iPhone models are eligible to download iOS 26 (both the betas and final version). Want to see the full list of new features coming this fall? Read on. \nWhat is iOS 26?\nThe current iPhone operating system is iOS 18, and Apple is still actively updating it — version 18.6.1 was released to restore Apple Watch blood oxygen monitoring functionality for certain users in the US. More recently, Apple released 18.6.2 to address a vulnerability related to image processing. But don't expect to see iOS 19 soon — or ever. Instead, Apple is skipping the numbering ahead to iOS 26 later this year. The company has decided to line up its iOS version numbers with a year-based system, similar to car model years. So while iOS and its sibling operating systems will be released in late 2025, they're all designated \"26\" to reflect the year ahead. \nIt's official, we're moving to iOS 26. (Apple)\nWhat is Liquid Glass design?\nLet's be honest. Out of everything announced at WWDC this year, the new Liquid Glass design was the star of the show. The iPhone's home and lock screens have looked pretty much the same year after year — the last exciting thing (in my opinion) was the option to add your own aesthetic to your home screen by customizing your apps and widgets. So seeing the home and lock screens' new facelift is refreshing.\nSo what exactly is Liquid Glass? Apple calls it a \"new translucent material\" since, well, the apps and widgets are clear. However, the screen can still adapt to dark and light modes, depending on surroundings. You'll also notice buttons with a new floating design in several apps, like Phone and Maps. They're designed to be less distracting than the current buttons, but are still easy to see. While the design overhaul has proven to be controversial since its announcement, some — including Engadget's own Devindra Hardawar — like the new direction, even if it's somewhat reminiscent of Microsoft's translucent Windows Vista Aero designs from nearly twenty years ago.\nThat said, as of the release of the iOS 26 beta 2, Apple has already incorporated some user feedback into the design, dialing back the transparency in at least some places. And while it will continue to evolve, Apple users won't be able to escape it: Liquid Glass was designed to make all of Apple's OSes more cohesive. Here's a look at how the translucent aesthetic will look with the new macOS Tahoe 26 on your desktop.\nWhat are the new and notable features of iOS 26?\niOS 26 has a laundry list of new features. Among the most worthwhile:\nPhone app redesign: You'll finally be able to scroll through contacts, recent calls and voicemail messages all on one screen. It also comes with a new feature called Hold Assist that'll notify you when an agent comes to the phone so you can avoid the elevator music and continue on with other tasks.\nLive Translation in Phone, FaceTime and Messages: iOS 26 is bringing the ability to have a conversation via phone call or text message with someone who speaks another language. Live Translation will translate your conversation in real time, which results in some stop-and-go interactions in the examples Apple shared during its presentation.\nPolls in group chats: Tired of sorting through what seems like hundreds of messages in your group chat? You and your friends will soon be able to create polls in group messages for deciding things like which brunch spot you're eating at or whose car you're taking on a road trip.\nFiltering unknown senders in Messages: If you haven't received spam texts about unpaid tolls or other citations, you're lucky. For those of us who have, those annoying messages will soon be filtered away in a separate folder.\nVisual Intelligence: Similar to a reverse Google image search, this new feature will allow you to search for anything that's on your iPhone screen. For instance, if you spot a pair of shoes someone is wearing in an Instagram photo, you can screenshot it and use Visual Intelligence to find those shoes (or similar ones) online.\nPhotos tabs are back: For anyone who's still frustrated with the Photos changes made last year, you'll be happy to know that your tabs are coming back. Library and Collections will have their own separate spaces so you don't have to scroll to infinity to find what you're looking for.\nFaceTime \"Communication Safety\" feature: A newer addition to iOS 26 appears to be the FaceTime \"Communication Safety\" feature that pauses communications if and when nudity is detected. The feature appears to be a child safety feature that uses on-device detection, thus obviating any cloud-based privacy issues. \nNew lock screen options: The iPhone lock screen gets more customizable in iOS 26, with a cooler clock, 3D wallpaper effects, more widgets and better focus mode options. \nApple's Hold Assist will be nifty for those pesky services that put you on hold for 10 or more minutes. (Apple)\nNew changes coming to iPadOS 26\nYour iPad isn't getting left behind when it comes to big updates. Here's what's coming this fall.\nMultitasking and real windowing: When you download the newest update, you'll be able to have multiple apps running on your screen at the same time. Once you open an app, it'll appear on your screen as normal but you'll be able to resize and move it across your screen to make room for other apps. This feature is optional so you can turn it off if you don't like it.\nVisual update: Along with the other new OSes, iPadOS 26 is coming with the Liquid Glass aesthetic. This new look will appear on the lock and home screens, as well as the drop-down menus.\nNew menu bar: When you swipe down on your screen, the new menu bar will appear with options like File, Edit, Windows and more. There's also a search option if you're looking for something specific.\nCheck out our first impressions of iPadOS 26. \nWhat about AirPods?\nAirPods are also getting updated with iOS 26. Here are some of the more notable functions.\nEnhanced audio recording: Apple calls this \"studio-quality\" audio recording, and with it, you'll notice more clarity while in noisy environments.\nCamera remote control: Using this, you can take a photo or start and stop video recording with just one press on your AirPods. When taking photos, you'll get a three-second countdown before your iPhone or iPad snaps the picture.\nLive translation feature: While not officially announced or confirmed, it appears that the long-rumored live translation for AirPods could be coming with iOS 26. The evidence comes from a system asset spotted in the in iOS 26 beta showing a gesture that's triggered by pressing both earbud stems at the same time. The photo also shows words in several different languages. \nWhich iPhones will be able to upgrade to iOS 26?\nA few iPhone models that run the current version of iOS — iPhone XR, XS and XS Max — won't be compatible with the latest upgrade. But any iPhones released in 2019 or later will be eligible for the iOS 26 update.\n\niPhone SE (second generation or later)\niPhone 11\niPhone 11 Pro\niPhone 11 Pro Max\niPhone 12\niPhone 12 mini\niPhone 12 Pro\niPhone 12 Pro Max\niPhone 13\niPhone 13 mini\niPhone 13 Pro\niPhone 13 Pro Max\niPhone 14\niPhone 14 Plus\niPhone 14 Pro\niPhone 14 Pro Max\niPhone 15\niPhone 15 Plus\niPhone 15 Pro\niPhone 15 Pro Max\niPhone 16\niPhone 16 Plus\niPhone 16 Pro\niPhone 16 Pro Max\niPhone 16e\n\nNot listed here are the presumed new iPhone 17 models (or maybe iPhone 26?) that are all but certain to be announced and released in September. \nHow to install iOS 26 beta\nThe iOS 26 public beta is now available to download via the Apple Beta Software Program. If you're not already a member, you'll need to sign up to try out all the latest features. Just visit beta.apple.com and sign up with your phone number or email address. It's free.\nOnce you're in, you can install it by going to Settings > General > Software Update and selecting iOS 26 public beta. \nA word of caution: Don't sign up with your main iPhone unless you're OK with any risks that occur with using an OS that isn't finalized.\nWhen will the final version of iOS 26 be released?\niOS 26 will be released to the public this fall. It usually comes in September, within a week of the Apple iPhone event. Last year, it rolled out to iPhone users on September 16 — exactly one week after the iPhone 16 lineup was announced.\nIf you're more interested in the Apple Intelligence features coming, here's everything Apple revealed for iOS, macOS and more during WWDC.

    "summary": "Welcome to Video Games Weekly on Engadget. Expect a new story every Monday or Tuesday (or Wednesday, whatever), broken into two parts. The first is a space for short essays and ramblings about video game trends and related topics from me, Jess Conditt, a reporter who's covered the industry for more than 13 years. The second contains the video game stories from the past week that you need to know about, including some headlines from outside of Engadget.\nPlease enjoy — and I'll see you next week.\n\nOn a planet shrouded in myth, in a land surrounded by lore, on a mountain draped in mystery, in a cave suffocated by secrets, the legend sleeps. For six years, the legend has slumbered while wild stories spiral around it, twisting and expanding and entwining. New words have been born and old words infused with evolved meanings: Believer. Doubter. Silkpost. The lies have grown so thick they’ve become corporeal, spreading trickery with a name and a dead smile.For six years, the legend has slept while the masses roiled, all of them waiting for the signal to awaken and know truth. All of them waiting for a bell that will ring, finally and clearly, on Thursday, August 21, 2025.Skong. Skong. Skong.\nIt’s a special time in the Silksong subreddit. After years of silence around its sequel, Hollow Knight: Silksong, Team Cherry has scheduled a livestream with a “special announcement” about the game for August 21 at 10:30AM ET. Not only is this exciting for Metroidvania fans everywhere, but it’s also possible that this announcement marks the final moments of the Silksong subreddit as we know it. A strange cocktail of game delays, inconsistent updates and hyper-focused cult fandom has cultivated a fascinating little universe in r/Silksong, complete with its own rules, villains and heroes. It’s a place where clown wigs are commonplace and contributors have turned trolling into a role-playing artform. A LARPform, if you will. It’s a place that’s consistently made me laugh every time it’s appeared in my feed over the past year or so.\nAhead of Thursday’s special announcement, this sub is experiencing the last gasps of desperate myth-making and hopeless anticipation before it transforms into something else entirely, armed with actual information about the sequel, gameplay videos and maybe even a firm release date. Or, dare I say it, a surprise launch. For just a moment longer in r/Silksong, anything is possible.\nAnd then it’ll be over. No matter what happens during Thursday’s livestream, the day will come when Silksong comes out and the drip-feed of silkposts dries up completely. But for now, our face paint is ready. Sometimes it’s just nice to recognize the madness and the beauty of the moment, before it slips away for good.\nUpdate August 21, 11:30AM ET: It happened.

There’s still no official word on how much they’ll cost, but there are hints: As spotted by Wario64, Best Buy recently listed the Xbox Ally at $550 and the Xbox Ally X at $900, and these fall in line with our predictions, which were based on the prices of existing ROG Ally handhelds. Alongside the release date, Microsoft announced the Handheld Compatibility Program, an initiative aimed at optimizing games for portable devices and informing players about how well they perform. It’s essentially Steam Deck Verified, but for Xbox handhelds, and it’s yet another sign that Microsoft’s portable gaming ambitions stretch beyond just one hardware manufacturer.\nThe PS5 will cost more tomorrow than it does today\nFirst Nintendo and Microsoft raised the prices of their latest consoles, and now it’s Sony’s turn. Sony on Wednesday announced the following price increases for the PS5 family:\n\nStandard PS5 with a disc drive: $550, up from $500\nPS5 digital edition: $500, up from $450\nPS5 Pro: $750, up from $700\n\nSony blames the increases on a “challenging economic environment,” echoing sentiments from its contemporaries. The price hikes come at a time in the hardware generation when we’re used to seeing consoles get cheaper, which just makes this whole thing more frustrating.\nRod Fergusson is in charge of BioShock again and already making big changes\nThere have been signs of turmoil at BioShock 4 studio Cloud Chamber for a while now, including news earlier this month that the game failed a review with 2K executives and was due for a complete narrative revamp. Now, we’re seeing even more fallout. Former Gears of War and Diablo head Rod Fergusson has left Blizzard to lead development of BioShock 4 at Cloud Chamber, and his appointment comes alongside news that 80 people at the studio are being laid off. This is actually the second time Fergusson has joined the development of a BioShock game at the last second — he similarly swooped in and cut aspects of BioShock: Infinite at Irrational Games in 2012.\nThe race through development hell between Judas and BioShock 4 continues.\nBlizzard’s cinematic and narrative team is unionizing\nMicrosoft is the home of another video game union. Workers with Blizzard Entertainment’s Story and Franchise Development team, which handles in-game cinematics and lore for titles including Overwatch and World of Warcraft, voted this week to unionize under the Communications Workers of America. This covers about 169 developers and it marks the fourth unionization effort from Microsoft’s gaming teams, joining QA workers at Activision, ZeniMax and Raven Software.\nSteam censorship is breaking PayPal\nPayPal isn’t a valid way to buy games on Steam in certain countries any longer. Steam in July removed hundreds of games with adult and NSFW themes from its storefront, and updated its policies to ban \"content that may violate the rules and standards” of its payment processors. This was incredibly vague and raised immediate concerns around financial censorship, especially when combined with a related culling of thousands of games from Itch.io. Now, it’s confirmed that PayPal has terminated its partnership with Steam in multiple countries, affecting any denomination “other than EUR, CAD, GBP, JPY, AUD and USD.”\nValve says it’s being pressured by payment processors including Visa, MasterCard and PayPal to remove certain games and implement puritanical censorship policies, and this has already resulted in at least one game being unjustly removed from the platform. That game, VILE: Exhumed, is now available as shareware.\nRoblox is changing its rules after so, so many child-safety lawsuits\nRoblox is locking down its system for sharing and viewing user-generated games following a wave of lawsuits accusing developers of failing to protect their young userbase. All unrated experiences, or user-created games, will be restricted to the developer and anyone actively working on them, rather than being available to anyone over the age of 13, as is currently the case. This change and others, including a new system that automatically detects and tracks \"violative scenes\" on individual servers, will roll out over the coming months.\nAnalogue delayed its N64 remake again\nIt’s now due out in Q4 2025. :(\nAdditional reading\n\nKris Holt’s indie game roundup\nMore action than RPG, Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 struggles to convince after a few hours' play by Robert Purchese at Eurogamer\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/video-games-weekly-silksong-and-gamescom-221635822.html?src=rss",

Not only is this exciting for Metroidvania fans everywhere, but it’s also possible that this announcement marks the final moments of the Silksong subreddit as we know it. Gamescom 2025 kicked off on Tuesday with Opening Night Live, a showcase hosted by Geoff Keighley and the folks behind The Game Awards, and there were plenty of delightful morsels on display. Alongside the release date, Microsoft announced the Handheld Compatibility Program, an initiative aimed at optimizing games for portable devices and informing players about how well they perform.

    "summary": "We've heard a lot this year about AI enabling new scams, from celebrity deepfakes on Facebook to hackers impersonating government officials. However, a new report suggests that AI also poses a fraud risk from the other direction — easily falling for scams that human users are much more likely to catch.\nThe report, titled \"Scamlexity,\" comes from a cybersecurity startup called Guardio, which produces a browser extension designed to catch scams in real time. Its findings are concerned with so-called \"agentic AI\" browsers like Opera Neon, which browse the internet for you and come back with results. Agentic AI claims to be able to work on complex tasks, like building a website or planning a trip, while users kick back.\nThere's a huge problem here from a security perspective: while humans are not always great at sorting fraud from reality, AI is even worse. A seemingly simple task like summarizing your emails or buying you something online comes with myriad opportunities to slip up. Lacking common sense, agentic AI may be prone to bumbling into obvious traps.\nThe researchers at Guardio tested this hypothesis using Perplexity's Comet AI browser, currently the only widely available agentic browser. Using a different AI, they spun up a fake website pretending to be Walmart, then navigated to it and told Comet to buy them an Apple Watch. Ignoring several clues that the site wasn't legit, including an obviously wonky logo and URL, Comet completed the purchase, handing over financial details in the process.\nIn another test, the study authors sent themselves an email pretending to be from Wells Fargo, containing a real phishing URL. Comet opened the link without raising any alarms and blithely dumped a bank username and password into the phishing site. A third test proved Comet susceptible to a prompt injection scam, in which a text box concealed in a phishing page ordered the AI to download a file.\nIt's just one set of tests, but the implications are sobering. Not only are agentic AI browsers susceptible to new types of scam, they may also be uniquely vulnerable to the oldest scams in the book. AI is built to do whatever its prompter wants, so if a human user doesn't notice the signs of a scam the first time they look, the AI won't serve as a guardrail.\nThis warning comes as every leader in the field bets big on agentic AI. Microsoft is adding Copilot to Edge, OpenAI debuted its Operator tool in January, and Google's Project Mariner has been in the works since last year. If developers don't start building better scam detection into their browsers, agentic AI risks becoming a massive blind spot at best — and a new attack vector at worst.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/ai-browsers-may-be-the-best-thing-that-ever-happened-to-scammers-220315936.html?src=rss",

Notably, Oracle landed a deal to back operations at OpenAI, in a partnership that will give the AI company 4.5 gigawatts of computing power. According to Bloomberg, that's enough energy to power \"millions of American homes.\"\nSo far, Oracle has seemed willing to throw money at its AI data center projects, no matter how expensive or irresponsible the needs might be.

    "summary": "Analogue's 4K take on the Nintendo 64 is… still not quite here. The company announced its third delay to the Analogue 3D on Wednesday, pushing the retro system back to Q4 2025. However, it said that's an intentionally conservative estimate, so this probably isn't a huge concern.\nThe postponement follows previous ones in March and July. (The last time was due to tariffs.) Analogue acknowledged the frustration pre-order customers must be feeling. \"We know this sucks,\" the Pocket maker wrote. \"Another delay, announced late, after months of patience. We feel it too.\"\nThe Analogue 3D uses an FPGA (field programmable gate array) chip to emulate N64 hardware. The company promises it will work with every official N64 cartridge ever released without any slowdowns or inaccuracies.\nAnalogue\nSo, why bother with the $250 console when you can grab a used Nintendo 64 for under $100? Well, Analogue's take supports 4K output, variable refresh rate displays and both PAL and NTSC carts. It's also adding \"original display mode\" filters to simulate old-school TVs. (They're similar to those you find on the company's highly rated Analogue Pocket handheld console.)\nAnalogue says the system is 99 percent done — including hardware, system and packaging. \"The last 1% is where we're focused,\" the company wrote. It says it wants every detail to meet its high standards. Nonetheless, pre-orderers who wish to bail can do so by contacting support.\nFrustrations aside, delays are indeed better than shipping incomplete products — even if only by one percent. \"We're pushing without pause and appreciate everyone's patience and trust,\" the company wrote in an email to customers. \"Analogue will always deliver — delays or not, it's a commitment to our standard of care.\"This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/analogue-delays-its-n64-remake-console-yet-again-205343467.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "The Qi2 wireless charging spec was originally announced back in early 2023. However, Android phone makers haven’t exactly been rushing to add Qi2 support to their latest devices since then. That’s made finding a compatible handset rather difficult, which is a bummer for anyone who has seen the wealth of accessories and power banks that iPhone owners have had access to for several generations.\nOn top of faster charging speeds (up to 25 watts or higher in later revisions), Qi2 dictates the inclusion of embedded magnets designed to make aligning and attaching peripherals a cinch.\nBut what makes the slow rollout a bit more frustrating is that Apple is a member of the Wireless Power Consortium (the governing body in charge of Qi2) and its MagSafe tech was used to help define the spec and ensure that compliant add-ons work seamlessly with Qi2, so it’s not like there’s a lack of compatible peripherals.\nRegardless, to help you figure out which Android phones officially come with Qi2, we’ve compiled a list of supported devices. (Note: Due to the complexities of the Chinese market, this list is primarily focused on gadgets available in North America and the EU.)\nAndroid phones with Qi2:\n\nThe HMD Skyline.\nThe Google Pixel 10 family.\n\nThat’s it, seriously. Though now this list does include one of the biggest Android phone makers in Google.\nThat said, there is one wrinkle with the Pixel 10 line. While Google's Pixelsnap standard is Qi2 compatible, wireless charging speeds for the base Pixel 10 and Pixel 10 Pro are staying the same at 15 watts. However, only the Pixel 10 Pro XL comes with support for the more powerful Qi2.2 spec which allows for wireless charging at up to 25 watts. So if you want the convenience of cable-free magnetic charging and want to do it as fast as possible, you're going to have to pay extra for the most premium version of the Pixel 10. \nThe status of other Android phone manufacturers\nBut what about the Galaxy S25? Unfortunately, despite Samsung saying that it will release multiple “Android devices supporting Qi2” this year, its latest batch of flagship phones (including S25 Edge, Galaxy Z Flip 7 and Galaxy Z Fold 7) are merely \"Qi2 ready.\" But what does that mean? Like previous models, the Galaxy S25 family can charge wirelessly at up to 15 watts. However, because the phones don't have magnets on their back, Qi2 accessories slide off when you try to attach them. This can be addressed by purchasing a compatible case with a built-in magnetic mounting system or a magnetic ring mount, but at least out of the box, the Galaxy S25 line requires additional assistance in order to work with the growing market of Qi2 peripherals.\nOnePlus also claims the OnePlus 13 supports Qi2. However, in our testing, the magnets inside the phone are so weak that it didn't latch on securely to any of the Qi2 accessories we tested. However, similar to the Galaxy S25, if you pair the OnePlus 13 with one of the company's magnetic cases, you can attach Qi2 peripherals as normal. \nFinally, when asked if it had plans to release Qi2-compatible phones, Motorola would only say that it is \"committed to bringing the latest technology across our devices.\"\nAs new phones with Qi2 hit the market, we will try to keep this list as up-to-date as possible. Or at least until the spec becomes a much more mainstream standard.\nUpdate, August 20 2025, 4:45PM ET: This story has been updated with info about Qi2 support on the Pixel 10 family. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/here-are-all-the-android-phones-that-support-qi2-150052702.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Microsoft is creating a new \"advanced shader delivery\" feature for the ASUS ROG Xbox Ally handhelds that might make loading games faster and more stutter-free. The company teased the upcoming feature alongside the announcement of the launch date for the first Xbox-branded handhelds and the company's new compatibility system for figuring out if games will run well on handhelds.\nShader stutter is a widespread issue in PC gaming that doesn't occur on consoles because of their uniform hardware. You have to download shaders for a PC game to make sure that they run correctly on your specific hardware. Typically, a game downloads shaders when they're first launched, which can add to the wait before you can actually start playing, and lead to things like framerate drops as shaders are compiled in the background. Microsoft's system \"preloads game shaders during download\" which the company says will allow games to launch up to 10 times faster, \"run smoother, and use less battery on first play.\"\nIt sounds like this new shader delivery system will require some amount of buy-in from developers, which means it likely won't impact every game at launch. It's just one of the ways Microsoft is trying to address the complexity and inefficiency Windows 11 can add to gaming. Besides including easier access to features like the Game Bar and ASUS' Armoury Crate software, the company also says that its handheld version of Windows will \"minimize background activity and defer non-essential tasks\" to devote more resources to playing games.\nMicrosoft wants theses handhelds to be a success, so it makes sense to put in the work. But in a world where Xbox home consoles look even more like Windows PCs, the company might also be making improvements now that it can take advantage of later.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/microsoft-is-working-on-a-fix-for-pc-shader-stutter-193616440.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "For nearly 30 years, developer Capcom has been redefining its particular brand of survival horror for the Resident Evil series. Despite its tone shifting between action-horror games and more pure horror entries, where players face down grotesque moments with scant resources, the series still manages to place players in tense encounters that define the series' against-all-odds approach to horror. And with the upcoming Resident Evil Requiem — or RE9 — appears to continue the series' current momentum in delivering compelling horror experiences.\nJust ahead of Gamescom 2025, I got to experience the opening of Resident Evil Requiem, focusing on new protagonist Grace Ashcroft (daughter of Alyssa Ashcroft from Resident Evil Outbreak) and her desperate attempt at fleeing a horrifying clinic within a strange mansion. Capcom's return to traditional survival horror was one of the best games showcased at Summer Game Fest 2025, and spending more time with it recently made me appreciate the series' renewed vision — even if it's a bit familiar.\n\nMuch like recent core entries in the Resident Evil series — VII and Village — Resident Evil Requiem places a keen focus on immersion, truly capturing that sense of dread as you walk down the halls of an unnerving facility. The larger story of Requiem seems to be pointing towards a homecoming of sorts for the series' most pivotal event — the destruction of Raccoon City in Resident Evil 2 and 3. While Requiem's story will expand into a more ambitious scope, the demo I played focused on Grace's harrowing attempt to escape her abductors.\nIn this sequence, Grace frees herself from an inverted hospital gurney and finds herself trapped in a ruined clinic filled with the bodies of dead doctors. In keeping with the brand of horror from the Resident Evil 2 remake and Resident Evil Village, I was being stalked by an imposing, grotesque monster hiding in the ceilings. Without weapons and with only empty bottles for distractions and sources of light to keep the beast at bay, the sequence felt very much like a stealth puzzle sequence, where I had to examine the movements of the beast and figure out a way to maneuver around it.\nI had previously seen this particular sequence during Summer Game Fest 2025. While I was impressed with its presentation — which features some of the most impressive lighting and character rendering I've seen from Capcom's RE Engine — I found the premise and scenario to be somewhat too familiar than I would have liked. Since Resident Evil VII, the series has leaned heavily into putting players in the series' most vulnerable moments, which often entail being stalked by imposing foes without any means to defend oneself.\nCapcom\nThat sense of vulnerability can often feel played out, especially within the current horror game space, where running away from things is its sub-genre. However, getting to play Resident Evil Requiem properly made me appreciate Capcom's attempt to maintain the momentum from Resident Evil VII. And a lot of that had to do with the fact that Requiem now stars a more fully defined protagonist. Ethan Winters from VII and Village was a faceless protagonist with somewhat generic motivations, but he gradually became more well-rounded by the end of his story in Village. Now, with Grace, we're thrust into an unfamiliar situation, as she's more of an active participant in the story — talking to herself throughout the demo — and I felt a stronger connection to her sense of vulnerability as a protagonist.\nOne of my favorite moments from the preview came shortly after I encountered the monster for the first time. After evading it, I went to the clinic's waystation to find a tool to open a fuse box. As I was wheeling a cart over to an elevated toolbox, the creature came into the room. As I tried hiding behind the cart, the monster spotted me and smashed the cart into me, which sent Grace hurling back to the wall. The beast then grabbed Grace and took a giant bite out of her shoulder. I used up my only health item and fled the room, returning to the well-lit safe that started the preview. Once the monster was gone, I snuck back into the waystation to retrieve the item — but more carefully this time around. It was a scary moment, but still totally exciting, and it had me on edge for the rest of the preview.\nCapcom\nMuch like Resident Evil VII and Village, Requiem is by default a first-person game, which certainly creates a palpable sense of dread and uneasiness when exploring with a limited perspective. However, Requiem also adds the option to switch to third-person, which was introduced post-launch for Resident Evil Village and its DLC, Shadows of Rose. Having played the demo from both perspectives, I was impressed with how well the presentation feels tuned for both styles. The third-person perspective captures that sense of dread and adds in the expanded visibility, which gave me a clear and distressing view of the monster stalking me from behind as I ran towards the safe room.\nIn the final stretch of my preview, I had all the tools I needed to make my exit. However, the storm outside the building blew out the lights in the area, allowing the monster to give chase. This sprint to the finish was tense and riveting. Even having seen the demo hands-off months prior, playing the sequence on my own made for a captivating experience. Once Grace made her exit, she had one last confrontation with the monster before the demo came to an abrupt end.\nCapcom\nSo far, Resident Evil Requiem feels like a souped-up version of the immersive survival horror found in recent entries of the series — and it does very well based on this preview. I appreciated just how atmospheric this one, fairly limited, area of the preview was — seeing the long stretch of the hallway, with only my lighter and a dim red light illuminating in the distance, made for a striking visual — especially with the silhouette of the monster looming in the distance.\nThat said, as well made as these sequences were, I'm already looking forward to seeing what sort of other tricks and events Requiem has in store. While I was a bit mixed on Village's Resident Evil amusement park-style structure, I'm hoping Requiem will still take some big swings with its new twist on the series' survival horror. I have plenty of questions about Resident Evil Requiem, but I'm intrigued about what's to come for this series' next big move ahead.\nResident Evil Requiem will be released on February 27, 2026 for PC, PS5, Xbox Series X|S.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/resident-evil-requiem-feels-very-familiar-but-its-so-well-made-that-i-respect-the-hell-out-of-it-180022141.html?src=rss",
