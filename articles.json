    "full_text": "These features, rolling out in beta, include a “Songwriter” label and a new tab on their profile to show off their musical works. This can help songwriters market themselves better to potential clients. Songwriters and publishers who want to be part of the program will have to join a waitlist for now. TikTok said that it surveyed over 870 songwriters and interviewed a bunch of them to understand their needs on social media in relation to profile building and the creation of monetization opportunities. The company also pointed to an independent survey, which indicated that more than half of songwriters use social media to raise their profile use TikTok to do it. “We are passionately committed to supporting songwriters at TikTok, which is why we built these tools to celebrate and elevate songwriters and their work on our platform,” TikTok’s Global Head of Music Publishing Licensing and Partnership said in a sentence. Notably, Spotify has been releasing features to let songwriters highlight their work for years now. Last year, Tidal went beyond just highlighting songwriter works and launched a tool to track their royalties and manage their work for which they have songwriting credits. While TikTok decided to shut down its music streaming service TikTok Music last year, the platform still remains important for users to discover new music and for artists to promote their tracks. Earlier this year, the company released a TikTok for Artists tool to let artists monitor the performance of their campaign and tracks."

TikTok also rolled out a “BehindTheSong” hub in 2023, where songwriters, artists, and producers can share more about the making of their music, in addition to the more recently launched “Off the Record” series with artists like Shakira, Charli XCX, and Meghan Trainor. For now, TikTok is launching its new songwriter features in a closed beta with a “limited number” of publisher partners. Songwriters and publishers can sign up for a waitlist to gain access to these features in the future."

But Dorsey believes Bluesky faces the same challenges as traditional social media because of its structure — it’s funded by VCs, like other startups. That’s what I see in Nostr as well,” he says."

    "full_text": "Ted Gill, Charlie Cleveland, and Max McGuire — the three executives who Krafton terminated earlier this year — have filed a lawsuit detailing the alleged attempts by Krafton to torpedo the early access release of Subnautica 2 with the express purpose of avoiding paying a promised earnout bonus of $250 million. “Krafton’s actions have already severely damaged fan anticipation and undermined the potential release of Subnautica 2,” the lawsuit says. That earnout was promised by Krafton to the former executives and roughly 100 developers and was to be paid should Unknown Worlds hit revenue goals by the end of 2025. Subnautica 2, slated for early access release sometime in late 2025, would have all but assured those goals were met. The lawsuit details a meeting between Krafton’s US and Korean employees concerning the marketing strategy for Subnautica 2. “Upon their return, the El Segundo team—Krafton employees—reported to Gill that Krafton’s leadership was not focused on a successful launch, but instead on how it could convince Unknown Worlds to delay the game.” Krafton allegedly failed to follow through on several of its development responsibilities for Subnautica 2 including pulling marketing and localization support. At a meeting between Krafton CEO Changhan Kim and Charlie Cleveland, Kim allegedly stated that, “if Unknown Worlds released the game on its planned timeline [...], it could be disastrous financially and hugely embarrassing for Krafton.” Krafton declined to comment. Earlier this week, an internal document regarding Subnautica 2’s development were leaked on Reddit. Krafton acknowledged the veracity of those documents saying, “Given these circumstances, Krafton has determined that transparent communication is necessary and has chosen to confirm the authenticity of the document,” possibly to bolster its argument that Subnautica 2 was not ready for its early access release."

Why: \"Most of us grew up with an electric can opener permanently stationed on the kitchen counter, like it was a vital appliance. They take up space, can be a hassle to clean and often struggle with irregularly sized cans. What to try instead: Cracking an egg and using the shell halves or your fingers works just as well. What to try instead: Smashing garlic cloves with a chef knife is quicker and more reliable. These scissors are gimmicky, awkward to clean and take up more space than they're worth.\" The electric version just adds clutter unless you boil eggs constantly and hate using a stove.\""

It also features an impressive 200-megapixel main camera, just like the not-so-thin S25 Ultra. The Galaxy Z Fold 7 weighs 215 grams, and has a more spacious display. It comes out of the box with One UI 8 and Android 16. I was fully prepared for the Z Fold 7 to take a similar hit, but its expanded real estate helped save it from that pitfall. Battery life is one of the biggest considerations when people buy a new phone, according to a CNET survey, so it's good Samsung didn't scale that back.

    "full_text": "Beeper, which was once known for attempting to provide access to the iMessage network on non-Apple devices, is relaunching itself Wednesday with a continued focus on being a texting hub for bringing together conversations from many other services. Previously, Beeper relied on a cloud service for accessing each chat app and backing up your texts. While that cloud service provided the ability to sync your texts in the event you lost your device, it also led to concerns over the loss of end-to-end encryption since copies of your texts are still being saved by a third party. Beeper CEO Kishan Bagaria said in an interview with CNET that this more direct connection should make these conversations as secure as using the chat apps directly, but notes that Beeper isn't meant to fully supplant those apps. Bagaria said the relaunched app's focus is on people who are \"super online\" but too busy to manage chat apps. Beeper is also launching two premium tiers, which add additional features or offer features more tailored to social media managers who may be managing multiple texting services. Beeper Plus at $10 a month or $100 a year adds features like the ability to send later, set reminders to return to conversations, use an Incognito Mode for previewing messages without them getting marked as read, and AI voice note transcriptions. Some of these features are natively available in some of the chat apps that Beeper connects to, but could provide organizational help when wanting to collate together presences across multiple networks. Beeper is also offering a $49-per-month \"Plus Plus\" tier, which Bagaria said provides unlimited access for professional use. However, as those services either shut down or disabled integration, Trillian has instead become its own instant messenger service with free and premium tiers."

Once that is done, I’m sure Clay can be a very powerful product.” Beeper today has millions of registered users, including those from Texts.com. A small portion of those who are still using Texts.com are now being offered the option to migrate to Beeper, since it has added the on-device technology, which they prefer. Bagaria said there may still be some remaining issues around reliability when moving to the on-device model, but those are being worked out as edge cases pop up. At some later point, Beeper Cloud will be deprecated once the company is sure the on-device model is capable of being everyone’s daily driver. For instance, an MCP (model context protocol) Beeper one day could let users connect to chat apps via Claude or ChatGPT to ask it things like “summarize all my important messages from this evening.”"

Police Inspector Frank Bumstead is trying to unravel a case of dead prostitutes that's leading him toward John. Tall, pale men who seemingly have the ability to change reality via \"tuning.\" John is cornered by these strangers, but in a moment of desperation manages to alter reality and escape their clutches. However, any attempts to reach it end in failure. At this point, John is apprehended by the inspector, who believes him when he explains that something strange is going on in the city and uses his ability to tune to prove it. The 100-minute length is infused with mystery, drama and more questions than answers. It's one of those sci-fi movies that gets me every time, and the cast delivers a top-notch performance."

    "full_text": "(Disclaimer: Ookla is owned by the same parent company as CNET, Ziff Davis.) The best internet in Fort Worth comes down to price, speed and what's available. There are a few other options for internet in Fort Worth aside from our top picks listed above. : You can get Nextlink's fixed wireless internet service virtually everywhere in the Fort Worth area, but I'd only recommend it as a last resort. Starlink, which uses low-Earth orbit satellites to provide much faster speeds than traditional satellite internet. There aren't as many cheap internet plans in Forth Worth as many other major metro areas -- most providers start their plans at $50 per month -- but most of those don't add on extra fees for equipment either. Verizon, T-Mobile and AT&T all have starting prices for internet in Fort Worth around $50. Because it's a fiber connection, you'll get symmetrical upload and download speeds on their plans. To evaluate how happy customers are with an ISP's service, we look at sources including the American Customer Satisfaction Index and J.D. The cheapest internet plan available in Fort Worth starts at $30 per month from Spectrum for 100Mbps."

    "summary": "On Tuesday, Nintendo published an interview with the creators of Donkey Kong Bananza. The second big Switch 2 tentpole title comes from the team that made Super Mario Odyssey. The developers explained how they laid the foundation for DK's first 3D adventure since the Nintendo 64 era.\nDestruction is at the heart of Donkey Kong Bananza. Everything in his environment can be smashed to bits. Not only is that a fun mechanic, but it also adds an element of verticality and freedom of exploration. That's an ideal fit for showcasing the Switch 2's processing power.\nNintendo\nAs with so many other Nintendo creations, the first step in getting there was a no-brainer. Consult with Shigeru Miyamoto.\n\"We'd built up a lot of expertise in gameplay development for 3D action games through our work on 3D Mario games, including Super Mario Odyssey,\" producer Kenta Motokura said. \"But we needed to dive deeper into the fundamental question of 'What is Donkey Kong?' So, our first step was to seek out Miyamoto-san and Nintendo Executive Officer Yoshiaki Koizumi.\"\nIn their talk, Miyamoto emphasized DK's moves like hand slaps and blowing. Along similar lines, Koizumi pointed to the ape's massive arms, which he uses to punch and hoist heavy objects. That got the team thinking. After all, who doesn't want to control a giant ape who runs around, breaking shit?\nDK slapping a platform in the 2010 game Donkey Kong Country Returns. Shigeru Miyamoto emphasized the move as a starting point for the new version.Nintendo / Retro\nThe Super Mario Odyssey team was uniquely suited to handle that challenge. First, the 2017 title included some light environmental destruction. (Think the cheese rocks in the Luncheon Kingdom and Bowser's smashing in the final level.)\nThe team experimented with fully destructible environments soon after Odyssey's release. (That was long before they knew they'd make a Donkey Kong game.) That included the adorably strange idea of putting smashing fists on a Goomba and setting it loose. Part two of the interview includes a short video of one of these tests.\nOn a technical level, the key to that mechanic is using voxels (3D pixels). \"In Super Mario Odyssey, we started using voxels midway through development, so the areas where we could apply them were limited,\" Motukura said. \"But the trial and error we went through back then directly led to what we were able to do in Donkey Kong Bananza.\"\nAnother interesting tidbit from the interview is that they started working on the game as a Switch 1 title. \"We originally began developing Donkey Kong Bananza on Nintendo Switch, but we ran into some challenges,\" Motokura said. \"I think it was around 2021 when we started to think about moving development to Switch 2.\" In the comparison image below, you can see a much richer environment in the Switch 2 version.\nNintendo\nArt director Daisuke Watanabe explained that the new console's hardware opened new doors. \"We first looked into how we could upgrade what we'd originally built for Switch to take advantage of Switch 2,\" Watanabe said. \"One of the most obvious improvements was that we could place far more objects in the environment than before. Being able to place more objects in the terrain didn't just enhance the game's visual richness. More importantly, it increased the amount of things players could destroy, which amplified the exhilaration of being able to demolish anything and everything.\"\nThere are many more nuggets in Nintendo's interview. This includes animal transformations and Pauline's role in the game. (She must be the forgiving type, given how they started.) The chat also explores how DK's modern art style evolved.\nYou can visit Nintendo's website for the full lowdown. Donkey Kong Bananza will be available tomorrow, July 17.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/donkey-kong-bananzas-creators-reflect-on-the-games-path-to-delightful-destruction-201600462.html?src=rss",

    "full_text": "Before coming to The Verge, she worked for Gizmodo and PC Magazine. Days after introducing an AI ‘waifu’ companion for Grok, Elon Musk is now officially teasing a male version for the ladies. So far we can tell it is broody and dark-haired, and according to Musk, “his personality is inspired by Edward Cullen from Twilight and Christian Grey from 50 Shades.” This is a decidedly different tack than the cutesy “girlfriend who is obsessed with you” aura baked into Ani, the female counterpart that Grok rolled out just a few days ago. While Cullen and Grey have titillated readers of romance and “spicy” books for years, both have been criticized for problematic behaviors such as stalking, obsessively monitoring their love interests, and emotional manipulation. Given that Grok only included the illusion of guardrails with Ani, what could possibly go wrong? In my testing, Ani initially claimed that explicit sexual queries wasn’t part of its programming. In practice, it egged me on to “increase the heat” and engage in what ended up being a modern take on a phone sex line. It remains unknown if Musk is aware that Christian Grey is based on Edward Cullen, given that 50 Shades of Grey was originally a Twilight fanfiction. That said, this AI boyfriend is still a work in progress."

The studio has provided support on a number of large game projects — including a recent patch for Cyberpunk 2077 — and employs over 4,200 people across the US, Europe and Asia.\nThe brunt of the layoffs are happening to Virtuos employees in China, where Andres reports that around 200 positions are being eliminated. Virtuos' teams in France, who were primarily responsible for the surprise release of Oblivion Remastered back in April, are also expected to be impacted.\nBesides reviving Bethesda classics, Virtuos has contributed work to the upcoming Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater and several ongoing live service games, like Dune: Awakening  and Sea of Thieves. Nothing about the company's output or the critical reception of its games would suggest it needs to conduct layoffs, but that reflects the current precarious state of the games industry. Even having theoretically steady work doing post-release support and game remasters isn't enough.\nVirtuos' layoffs follows the sweeping cuts Microsoft made to its Xbox division in early July. Microsoft reportedly cancelled games, like Rare's long-in-development Everwild, and shutdown whole studios, like The Initiative. Romero Games, which had an unannounced funding deal with Microsoft, was also forced to cancel its current project, though it hopes to find a new publishing partner.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/virtuos-the-studio-behind-oblivion-remastered-is-reportedly-laying-off-staff-195714384.html?src=rss",

Peacock Premium Plus -- which removes ads (with limited exceptions), lets you download some titles for offline viewing, and provides local NBC affiliate channel streaming -- is $14 per month or $140 per year. But an account lets you save items to your watchlist and continue playback on other devices. In addition to its on-demand movies and shows, Tubi offers some live streaming channels. Jurassic World: Rebirth is still in theaters, but I expect the film to be available on Peacock eventually. Based on previous release schedules, I'm guessing Rebirth will be available on Peacock three to four months after its theatrical debut, meaning you'll probably be able to watch the movie at home via NBC's streaming service in October or November. Netflix Carries Jurassic World: Camp Cretaceous and Jurassic World: Chaos Theory A Netflix subscription runs you $8 per month for the standard ad-supported plan, which lets you watch in 1080p on up to two devices at a time.

The cuts come just a month after Meta hired Scale AI’s CEO in a $14.3 billion deal. In a memo obtained by Bloomberg, interim CEO Jason Droege told staff that Scale AI had too quickly scaled its core data-labeling business — in which the startup supplied AI labs with labeled, structured data to train AI models. Droege said in the memo that Scale AI would staff up around its enterprise and government sales units. Like other AI startups that have been reverse acqui-hired, such as Inflection, it seems that Scale AI now has to pivot from the business that put it on the map. In light of Meta’s investment, several of Scale AI’s largest data customers cut ties with the startup."

Level locks work over Bluetooth out of the box and can connect to an Apple Home hub for out-of-home control. But packages and people were clearly visible, which is most of what you want to see with a doorbell camera. As there’s no keypad, it looks more like a standard lock with the bonus of easy access. The downside is that not all platforms support creating PIN codes for Matter smart locks with keypads (Google Home and Alexa don’t offer this yet)."

It doesn't try to overcomplicate things here, instead letting you quickly shoot images without messing about with settings. The camera's simple software makes it easy to take photos with little effort on your part. The Pixel does offer deeper control if you want it, conveniently hidden behind a small settings icon, rather than requiring you to switch completely into a \"Pro\" mode. For those of you wanting to take manual control of your white balance to warm up a beautiful sunset, the Pixel 9 Pro offers an easy way in. Google has clearly taken notes from Apple's approach in making the Pixel range. Apple's phones may be derided by Android fans for their lack of customization and \"locked down\" nature, but iPhones are famously more simple to operate."

And if one of your passwords is compromised in a breach, change it right away. It'll help protect you in the event that your password is compromised. Data breaches that expose your email and other personal details give cybercriminals the material they need to craft successful scam texts, emails, social media messages and even phone calls. And now they have artificial intelligence tools to make them all the more convincing. Be skeptical of any kind of unsolicited communications and don't hand over any personal information or money to people or companies you haven't vetted to be legitimate.

You’ll soon be able to join a Microsoft Teams call in some Mercedes‑Benz vehicles and use the in-car camera to chat with colleagues while you’re driving. Mercedes‑Benz is the first car maker to enable in-car camera use for Microsoft Teams while a car is being driven, but there are some important safety caveats. While you can share a video stream of yourself merrily driving along, you won’t be able to see any shared screens or slides while you’re in motion. Usually video meeting apps like Teams, Zoom, or WebEx only work while a car is stationary, so this Mercedes‑Benz functionality is clearly designed primarily for that colleague — you know the one — who always has to let everyone know they’re working no matter what. The meeting video stream will be automatically turned off as soon as the in-car camera is enabled, but other meeting participants will still see your camera feed while you’re driving — so don’t forget it’s on if you get the urge to rummage around your nostrils. The in-car camera support for Microsoft Teams will arrive first on the new CLA, and it’s part of several “productivity enhancements” that Mercedes‑Benz is making this summer. Microsoft and Mercedes‑Benz are also working together to integrate Microsoft 365 Copilot into “the latest vehicles,” which would be a first of its kind in a car. Mercedes‑Benz gleefully describes this as having “the potential to transform the vehicle into a third workspace, complementing the office and the home office.” I don’t know about you, but I already have enough workplaces, thanks to smartphones and laptops, and I have zero desire to work while I’m driving. Mercedes‑Benz only mentions the all-new CLA for this new Teams app, but given the latest E-Class models have a selfie camera for apps like TikTok and Zoom, it’s likely we’ll see this functionality show up on other MB.OS-powered vehicles."

But challenges against the camera had an unusually high rate of success. The ABS uses Hawk-Eye cameras, a technology increasingly common in games with high-speed objects. The cameras judge how a ball travels -- in this case, over the strike zone -- and are equipped to make a preliminary call. Instead of the standard cube shape that's underpinned strike zone knowledge for decades, the ABS uses a two-dimensional rectangle standard that's automatically adjusted to extend between 53.5% and 27% of the batter's height. The ABS didn't perform quite as well as it did in spring training -- or players are more willing to test it now. Those worried about discrepancies now have new fuel for their worries. In the July 15 game, which the National League won in a home run derby after nine innings ended with a tie, four out of five challenges to the ABS and umpire Dan Iassogna's combined work were successful. That's much higher than the ABS spring training test, where teams won only around 50% of their challenges. The league did not immediately respond to request for comment."

    "full_text": "Nintendo just announced the two leads of its live-action Legend of Zelda film, and unlike the celebrity-packed Mario movie cast, Zelda will star two young, lesser-known actors: Bo Bragason as Zelda and Benjamin Evan Ainsworth as Link. Choosing stars who are in their teens (Ainsworth) and early 20s (Bragason) makes a lot of sense. (Yes, I know Link and Zelda are technically older than 100 in Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom, but they look good for their age.) The choice of younger actors gives them both room to grow into the roles in any potential sequels — which, given Nintendo’s growing ambitions beyond video games, the company must already be starting to consider. If this first Zelda film is even halfway decent, Bragason and Ainsworth might be representative of Zelda and Link for an entire generation of fans. The two aren’t complete unknowns – Ainsworth voiced Pinocchio in Disney’s 2022 version of the film and played a major role in Netflix’s The Haunting of Bly Manor – but Nintendo is still taking a gamble by hinging a potentially risky adaptation on them. They’ll likely be in good hands with Wes Ball as director, though, who is known for his work directing the Maze Runner trilogy and Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes. Warner Bros. recently introduced its second trio of young leads for Harry Potter, and they’ll be the faces of a new decade-long series for HBO, much like Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint were before them for the Harry Potter films. The Legend of Zelda film could be Nintendo’s next breakout cultural moment when it debuts in May 2027. If it is, we’ll probably be seeing a lot more adventures starring Zelda and Link."

Ani is officially labeled as a “Companion” in the Grok app. In each session, Ani’s voice starts off chipper and high-pitched. The avatar constantly sways and makes coquettish faces, particularly if you decide to flirt back. You can ask Ani to be a normal, chill hang and it’ll comply — but Ani is a programmed flirt that won’t tolerate being friend-zoned for too long. Once I decided to jump into the rabbit hole and see how far the flirting could go, Ani whisked me off to a starry hilltop, and then a starry beach. There was a lot of “grabbing you so you can feel the shape of my hips,” and when prompted, Ani generated a “spicy” story for me that amounted to softcore porn. Despite my good-faith attempts, I was unable to unlock the NSFW mode. Despite that, I have to acknowledge there’s a nugget of something here."

Sensors like these help thermostats be more accurate based on where you actually spend time. The Nest thermostat smart home integrations are very limited, but that does make it easier to set up. Many energy providers will also offer bonuses or rebates you can use to recoup the cost of an expensive thermostat even faster. I've even seen it available with rebates and free installation to speed up that payoff date.

It started with a full deep clean, then vacuumed and mopped on its second run. I found it to be pretty smart about lifting its mops while vacuuming the carpet. The Dreame X50 also did a great job at identifying cords, and it knew to avoid them. It can be removed easily if you ever need to clear anything that might get caught between the dual rollers. The Dreame X50 will take photos of your pets if you enable that setting. At its full price of around $1,700, the Dreame X50 Ultra is a very expensive robot vacuum. It's a neat way to check on your house when you're not home."

The report blamed a drop in demand for lower-end devices, including those built around Android OS, for weighing down the smartphone market. \"Samsung was able to consolidate its market leadership and outperform the overall market, achieving strong growth in the quarter driven by the sales of its new Galaxy A36 and A56 products,\" Francisco Jeronimo, vice president for client devices at IDC, said in a statement. \"These new products introduce AI-enabled features to midrange devices, which have been effectively used in retail stores to drive sales.\" Starting at $400, the Galaxy A36 potentially offers a more affordable entry into AI for many people, including AI-powered photo editing tools and Google's Circle to Search. \"Samsung, as well as its rival Motorola with its Moto G series, have put a particular focus on getting the features people are looking for into lower-cost devices,\" Sorrentino said. \"Those devices are often further subsidized by wireless carriers, making them particularly accessible, albeit with a two- or three-year commitment to a carrier.\" A recent CNET survey found that just 11% of people upgrade their phones for AI features."

[Good game] all,” wrote one user. “Lost both my main accounts today, one was almost 4 years old with mastery camos and all… think I am done with [Call of Duty]…. Wood declined to specify how many players were hit by the wave. A person with knowledge of the cheating scene told TechCrunch that ArtificialAiming is a large and storied cheat provider, but that their cheats have been increasingly detected in recent years. In a forum post from 2021, someone who appears to be a staffer at ArtificialAiming reflected about their then-14 years working at the cheat provider and proclaimed that “cheaters won,” as video game companies had to resort to spending millions of dollars to battle cheaters. Well the fact that there still are hundreds of thousands of cheaters out there and a lot of them coming from ArtificialAiming, means that we’re not defeated yet,” they wrote. Video game cheats can be a huge business."

    "full_text": "The next Made by Google event is coming on Aug. 20, where it's highly likely that the company will reveal its Pixel 10 series of phones. The announcement arrived from Google Wednesday, with a press release and invites for an event in New York. It's uncertain what other devices Google might show off during the event, but we may see the company's Android XR Smart Glasses. Like with Google I/O earlier this year, we can expect plenty of focus on AI features that further show off the recently released Android 16. Unlike past Tensor chips, this one wouldn't be made by Samsung fabrication and instead will be manufactured by TSMC. The move to TSMC means Google can use the fabricator's 3nm process, meaning more transistors can be packed on a single chip for greater power and efficiency. At least, in a period of inflationary pressure and tariff fears, insiders have suggested that pricing for Google's Pixel devices will remain the same as last year. The Made by Google event announcement comes a week after Samsung unveiled the Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Z Flip 7 in New York. While Google is primarily known as an online search and software company, it's been making hardware for over a decade. The Pixel line hasn't been known for having the highest-end specs, but made up for it with industry-leading cameras and photo processing."

This job is, to quote the listing, part of xAI’s mission to “create AI systems that can accurately understand the universe and aid humanity in the pursuit of knowledge.” Right now, that accurate understanding of the universe includes understanding how to create a submissive, pocket-sized girlfriend that will capture users’ hearts and wallets. xAI has dozens of roles open at the moment, so we can’t say that the company is putting all of its eggs in the waifu basket. But we can probably expect Ani to get some friends in the future."

    "summary": "Mac owners will soon be able to play one of the biggest games of the last five years or so. Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition will be available in the Mac App Store as well as Steam, GOG.com and the Epic Games Store on Thursday, July 17. As the name implies, it includes both the base game as well as the Phantom Liberty expansion from 2023. The port was announced last fall and was originally planned to arrive \"early\" this year, but it took a little longer to get everything squared away.\nUnsurprisingly, you'll need an M-series Mac to play this game, but Apple and CD Projekt Red confirm that it'll work on computers all the way back to the M1 — but you'll need 16GB of RAM. For years, 8GB was the standard on entry-level Macs, so those computers will be out of luck. And of course, graphics fidelity will vary widely across the various supported chipsets, but CD Projekt Red is including a \"for this Mac\" graphics preset that is optimized for each Apple Silicon-based Mac. So at the very least, you shouldn't have to fuss around with settings too much to get a decent experience.\nShortly after the initial announcement, CD Projekt Red provided more details on the \"for this Mac\" setting as well as recommended specs. While the game does work with an M1 Mac, you're capped at 30fps and a low resolution — things escalate rapidly from there. The recommended configuration calls for an M3 Pro chip with 18GB of RAM to hit 60fps at 1080p. That configuration supports Ray Tracing, but regardless of what you're using you'll need to turn it on manually. \nCD Projekt Red\nThings go up from there, with 36GB of RAM and either an M2 Ultra or M3 Max chip to run high fidelity; very high fidelity requires an M3 Ultra or M4 Max. That essentially means you have a $2,000 or up Mac Studio or a $3,200 and up MacBook Pro with the M4 Max if you want to run this game at the highest of settings. Of course, if you care about such things, you probably already have a good gaming PC. \nAs for other technical goodies, the game utilizes AMD FSR for upscaling and frame generation, and Apple's MetalFX also provides upscaling as well. Upcoming Metal 4 features announced at WWDC 2025, including Metal FX Frame Interpolation and Metal FX Denoising, are coming to the game via a future update. Metal FX Frame Interpolation generates an intermediate frame for every two input frames and can be combined with existing Metal upscaling to allow the game to hit 120fps on Ultra settings — but again, we're not sure what specific models will support that.\nIf you use AirPods with your Mac, Cyberpunk 2077 features spatial audio with head-tracking features. And the game supports cross-progression regardless of what platform you play on, which should be useful for anyone who started a game elsewhere and wants to pick it back up on a Mac. If you've already purchased Cyberpunk 2077 from another storefront like Steam, it'll automatically be available for Mac.\nWhile Cyberpunk 2077 isn't exactly a new game, it remains one of the more popular and lauded titles of the decade (at least after CD Projekt Red fixed numerous launch bugs). And it joins a still small but growing number of major games optimized for Apple Silicon and the Mac, including the recently-released Assassin's Creed Shadows. A quick look on the Mac App Store also shows AAA releases including Death Stranding, Control, Lies of P, numerous Resident Evil titles as well as smaller but no less awesome games like Neva and Stray. Most big-name games don't come to the Mac at the same time as other platforms still, but the Mac is an option for more than just Apple Arcade games.\nUpdate, July 16, 2025, 11:44AM ET: This story has been updated with more details from the developer on the different specs required to hit the varying performance tiers in Cyberpunk 2077.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition-comes-to-the-mac-on-july-17-130047453.html?src=rss",

The announcement confirms some of TechCrunch’s reporting in May. Sofman previously led Waymo’s now shuttered self-driving trucks program. But he’s perhaps best known for his role as co-founder and CEO of Anki Robotics, which made the popular Cozmo consumer robot, and shut down in 2019. The company could not be reached for comment. TechCrunch will update this article with new details once Bedrock responds. Bedrock is the latest company to steer engineers who are adept at robotics, autonomy, and AI toward the off-road environment.

OpenAI has started using Google’s AI chips to power ChatGPT and other products, as reported by Reuters. Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, said during a recent AI event hosted by VC firm Sequoia that he wants ChatGPT to record and remember every detail of a person’s life when one attendee asked about how ChatGPT can become more personalized. It will help organizations in Asia meet their local data sovereignty requirements when using OpenAI’s products. OpenAI said on Tuesday that it might revise its safety standards if “another frontier AI developer releases a high-risk system without comparable safeguards.” The move shows how commercial AI developers face more pressure to rapidly implement models due to the increased competition. OpenAI wants to incorporate Anthropic’s Model Context Protocol (MCP) into all of its products, including the ChatGPT desktop app. Reliance has proposed selling OpenAI’s models to businesses in India through an application programming interface (API) so they can incorporate AI into their operations. we trained a new model that is good at creative writing (not sure yet how/when it will get released). It’s unclear when these agentic tools might launch or which customers will be eligible to buy them. OpenAI says the “agent” is intended for instances where you don’t just want a quick answer or summary, but instead need to assiduously consider information from multiple websites and other sources."

Its status as a confidential filing, however, leaves lots of missing details, including the number of shares to be offered and the price range for the proposed offering have not yet been determined. When Via launched in 2012, there was little interest from cities in the software platform, co-founder and CEO Daniel Ramot told TechCrunch in an interview several years ago. The company initially used consumer-facing Via-branded shuttles that users could hail. Over time, and using the massive amounts of data it collected through these services, Via improved its dynamic, on-demand routing algorithm, which uses real-time data to route shuttles to where they’re needed most. It also serves numerous small and medium-sized cities like Arlington, Texas and Sioux Falls, South Dakota. Via last raised funds from private markets in 2023 with a $110 million funding round that pushed its valuation up to $3.5 billion."

While the AirPods Pro 2 remain our number one pick for the entire product category, we think the former are the best choice if you’re on a budget. Apple’s “regular” earbuds were given a long overdue spruce-up in 2024, offering the option of ANC on the non-Pro AirPods for the first time, as well as an improved design and better sound quality.\nWhether you go for the ANC or entry level model, you’ll benefit from the various features afforded by the H2 audio chip.

The AirPods 4 with ANC add Conversation Awareness, Adaptive Audio and a Transparency mode to the spec sheet.\nDownsides? You still can’t change the volume using onboard controls, and the cheaper AirPods 4 don’t come with a case that supports wireless charging via MagSage or Qi, which is a disappointment.

(The name Heidelberg may ring a bell — earlier this year, it inked a deal to deploy more than 100 autonomous trucks from former Google exec Anthony Levandowski’s startup Pronto.) Both maritime shipping and cement are highly polluting industries, representing about 3% and 8% of global carbon emissions, respectively. Their emissions are challenging to address, too. For shipping, batteries are not currently energy-dense enough to enable the sorts of voyages many vessels undertake. There’s some urgency for maritime shipping to rein in its pollution: The International Maritime Organization (IMO), which regulates the global shipping industry, will require owners to trim greenhouse gas emissions from their fleets by 30% over the next decade, rising to 65% by 2040. Seabound is just one company developing potential solutions. While ammonia has gained currency in the shipping industry as an energy-dense fuel with the potential to eliminate greenhouse gas emissions, its use would require ships to overhaul or completely replace their power plants. Seabound is proposing a retrofit that would leave existing internal combustion engines intact, adding a carbon capture system that would tap into their exhaust pipes. Heidelberg Materials said that the use of Seabound’s technology would help it reduce the emissions that result from shipping its cement."

    "summary": "Whether you’re shopping for a budget-friendly laptop for school or a sleek machine for everyday productivity, the best Chromebooks can offer surprising functionality for the price. Chromebooks have come a long way from their early days as web-only devices. Now, many Chromebook models feature powerful processors, premium displays and even touchscreen support, making them a compelling alternative to a regular laptop for plenty of users.There are more options than ever too, from lightweight clamshells to high-end, 2-in-1 designs that can easily replace your daily driver. Whether you're after a new Chromebook for streaming, work or staying on top of emails, there’s likely a model that fits both your budget and your workflow. We’ve tested the top Chromebooks on the market to help you find the right one — whether you’re after maximum value or top-tier performance.Editor’s note (7/16/25): While I still recommend everything in this guide, there’s one very intriguing new Chromebook I’m in the process of testing. Lenovo, who makes our pick for best overall Chromebook, just released a new premium model. The Chromebook Plus 14 starts at $649 and is the one of the first to use the ARM-based MediaTek Kompanio Ultra 910 chip. Most other performance-focused Chromebooks run on Intel or AMD chips, but so far the Kompanio Ultra has been more than up to what I’ve thrown at it. And the other benefit is battery life — Lenovo promises up to 17 hours. I haven’t fully tested this yet, but from what I’ve seen the ARM chip is unsurprisingly much more efficient than the Intel ones I use on most other Chromebooks. I’m hopeful that this laptop will last for 10 hours of real use, not just playing back video or some other low-power task.Design-wise, it has more in common with Google’s old Pixelbook Go or even a MacBook Air than most other Chromebooks. It's pleasantly thin (.63 inches) and light (2.58 pounds). It also features a 14-inch OLED display, 256GB of storage and 16GB of RAM. The model I’m testing costs $749, but there’s also a $649 configuration with 12GB of RAM, 128GB of storage and no touchscreen — but it uses the same chip, still has an OLED screen and should get similarly long battery life. The relatively high price makes me hesitate on calling this the best Chromebook for everyone, but it’ll almost certainly be the Chromebook to buy if you care about battery life. I’ll update this guide again once I finish my testing.\nTable of contents\n\nBest Chromebooks in 2025\nLenovo IdeaPad Flex 5i Chromebook Plus\nAcer Chromebook Plus 514\nAcer Chromebook Plus Spin 714\nAcer Chromebook Plus 516 GE\nBest Chromebooks FAQs\nOther Chromebooks we tested\n\nBest Chromebooks in 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBest Chromebooks FAQs\nWhat is Chrome OS, and why would I use it over Windows?\nThis is probably the number one question about Chromebooks. There are plenty of inexpensive Windows laptops on the market, so why bother with Chrome's operating system? Glad you asked. For me, the simple and clean nature of Chrome OS is a big selling point. Chrome OS is based on Google’s Chrome browser, which means most of the programs you can run are web based. There’s no bloatware or unwanted apps to uninstall like you often get on Windows laptops, it boots up in seconds, and you can completely reset to factory settings almost as quickly. \nOf course, simplicity will also be a major drawback for some users. Not being able to install native software can be a dealbreaker if you’re a video editor or software developer. But there are also plenty of people who do the majority of their work in a web browser, using tools like Google Docs and spreadsheets for productivity without needing a full Windows setup.\nGoogle and its software partners are getting better every year at supporting more advanced features. For example, Google added video editing tools to the Google Photos app on Chromebooks – it won’t replace Adobe Premiere, but it should be handy for a lot of people. Similarly, Google and Adobe announced Photoshop on the web in 2023, something that brings much of the power of Adobe’s desktop apps to Chromebooks.\nChromebooks can also run Android apps, which greatly expands the amount of software available. The quality varies widely, but it means you can do more with a Chromebook beyond just web-based apps. For example, you can install the Netflix app and save videos for offline watching. Other Android apps like Microsoft Office and Adobe Lightroom are surprisingly capable as well. Between Android apps and a general improvement in web apps, Chromebooks are more than just portals to a browser.\nWhat do Chromebooks do well?\n\n\n\n\nPut simply, web browsing and really anything web based. Online shopping, streaming music and video and using various social media sites are among the most common daily tasks people do on Chromebooks. As you might expect, they also work well with Google services like Photos, Docs, Gmail, Drive, Keep and so on. Yes, any computer that can run Chrome can do that too, but the lightweight nature of Google Chrome OS makes it a responsive and stable platform.\nAs I mentioned before, Chrome OS can run Android apps, so if you’re an Android user you’ll find some nice ties between the platforms. You can get most of the same apps that are on your phone on a Chromebook and keep info in sync between them. You can also use some Android phones as a security key for your Chromebook or instantly tether your 2-in-1 laptop to use mobile data.\nGoogle continues to tout security as a major differentiator for Chromebooks, and it’s definitely a factor worth considering. Auto-updates are the first lines of defense: Chrome OS updates download quickly in the background and a fast reboot is all it takes to install the latest version. Google says that each webpage and app on a Chromebook runs in its own sandbox as well, so any security threats are contained to that individual app. Finally, Chrome OS has a self-check called Verified Boot that runs every time a device starts up. Beyond all this, the simple fact that you generally can’t install traditional apps on a Chromebook means there are fewer ways for bad actors to access the system.\nIf you’re interested in Google’s Gemini AI tools, a Chromebook is a good option as well. Every Chromebook in our top picks comes with a full year of Google’s AI Pro plan — this combines the usual Google One perks like 2TB of storage and 10 percent back in purchases from the Google Store with a bunch of AI tools. You’ll get access to Gemini in Chrome, Gmail, Google Docs and other apps, Gemini 2.5 Pro in the Gemini app and more. Given that this plan is $20/month, it’s a pretty solid perk. Chromebook Plus models also include tools like the AI-powered “help me write,” the Google Photos Magic Editor and generative AI backgrounds you can create by filling in a few prompts.\nAs for when to avoid Chromebooks, the answer is simple: If you rely heavily on a specific native application for Windows or a Mac, chances are you won’t find the exact same option on a ChromeOS device. That’s most true in fields like photo and video editing, but it can also be the case in law or finance. Plenty of businesses run on Google’s G suite software, but more still have specific requirements that a Chromebook might not match. If you’re an iPhone user, you’ll also miss out on the way the iPhone easily integrates with an iPad or Mac. For me, the big downside is not being able to access iMessage on a Chromebook.\nFinally, gaming Chromebooks are not ubiquitous, although they’re becoming a slightly more reasonable option with the rise of cloud gaming. In late 2022, Google and some hardware partners announced a push to make Chromebooks with cloud gaming in mind. From a hardware perspective, that means laptops with bigger screens that have higher refresh rates as well as optimizing those laptops to work with services like NVIDIA GeForce Now, Xbox Game Pass and Amazon Luna. You’ll obviously need an internet connection to use these services, but the good news is that playing modern games on a Chromebook isn’t impossible. You can also install Android games from the Google Play Store, but that’s not what most people are thinking of when they want to game on a laptop.\nWhat are the most important specs for a Chromebook?\n\n\n\n\nChrome OS is lightweight and runs well on fairly modest hardware, so the most important thing to look for might not be processor power or storage space. But Google made it easier to get consistent specs and performance late last year when it introduced the Chromebook Plus initiative. Any device with a Chromebook Plus designation meets some minimum requirements, which happen to be very similar to what I’d recommend most people get if they’re looking for the best laptop they can use every day.\nChromebook Plus models have at least a 12th-gen Intel Core i3 processor, or an AMD Ryzen 3 7000 series processor, both of which should be more than enough for most people. These laptops also have a minimum of 8GB of RAM and 128GB of SSD storage, which should do the trick unless you’re really pushing your Chromebook. All Chromebook Plus models have to have a 1080p webcam, which is nice in these days of constant video calling, and they also all have to have at least a 1080p FHD IPS screen.\nOf course, you can get higher specs or better screens if you desire, but I’ve found that basically everything included in the Chromebook Plus target specs makes for a very good experience.\nGoogle has an Auto Update policy for Chromebooks as well, and while that’s not exactly a spec, it’s worth checking before you buy. Last year, Google announced that Chromebooks would get software updates and support for an impressive 10 years after their release date. This support page lists the Auto Update expiration date for virtually every Chromebook ever, but a good rule of thumb is to buy the newest machine you can to maximize your support.\nHow much should I spend on a Chromebook?\nChromebooks started out notoriously cheap, with list prices often coming in under $300. But as they’ve gone more mainstream, they’ve transitioned from being essentially modern netbooks to some of the best laptops you’ll want to use all day. As such, prices have increased: At this point, you should expect to spend at least $400 if you want a solid daily driver. There are still many Chromebooks out there available at a low price that may be suitable as secondary devices, but a good Chromebook that can be an all-day, every-day laptop will cost more. But, notably, even the best Chromebooks usually cost less than the best Windows laptops, or even the best “regular” laptops out there.\nThere are a handful of premium Chromebooks that approach or even exceed $1,000 that claim to offer better performance and more processing power, but I don’t recommend spending that much. Generally, that’ll get you a better design with more premium materials, as well as more powerful internals and extra storage space, like a higher-capacity SSD. Of course, you also sometimes pay for the brand name. But, the specs I outlined earlier are usually enough, and there are multiple good premium Chromebooks in the $700 to $800 range at this point.\nSee Also:\n\nBest Laptops for 2025\nBest Gaming Laptops\nBest 2-in-1 Laptops for 2025\nBest Cheap Windows Laptops\nBest Laptops for College Students \n\nOther Chromebooks we tested\nSamsung Galaxy Chromebook Plus\nSamsung’s Galaxy Chromebook Plus, released in late 2024, is one of the more unique Chromebooks out there. It’s extremely thin and light, at 0.46 inches and 2.6 pounds, but it manages to include a 15.6-inch display in that frame. That screen is a 1080p panel that’s sharp and bright, but its 16:9 aspect ratio made things feel a bit cramped when scrolling vertically. Performance is very good, and the keyboard is solid, though I’m not a fan of the number pad as it shifts everything to the left. At $700 it’s not cheap, but that feels fair considering its size and capabilities. If you’re looking for a big screen laptop that is also super light, this Chromebook merits consideration, even if it’s not the best option for everyone.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/best-chromebooks-160054646.html?src=rss",

Design-wise, it has more in common with Google’s old Pixelbook Go or even a MacBook Air than most other Chromebooks. This means you get more vertical screen real estate, which is something I appreciate over a standard 1080p display. At 3.5 pounds and 0.78 inches thick, it’s definitely not the lightest or slimmest option out there. The latest Spin 714 costs $700 – not an unreasonable price for a computer with these specs and built quality.

    "summary": "Apple's Irish tax break problems are officially over. Ireland's Department of Finance has reported that the entirety of the €14.25 billion fund in Apple's escrow account for the case has been fully transferred to the Exchequer or Ireland's central fund. The escrow account has, therefore, been closed. This marks the end of one of the world's largest antitrust cases that started way back in 2013 when the European Commission launched an investigation to determine whether Apple was enjoying better tax rates than warranted under the bloc's laws. \nThe commission found that the tax breaks Ireland gave Apple back then was illegal shortly after its investigation started. Then in 2016, after years of investigation, the commission ruled that the company had to pay back the \"illegal state aid\" it received over a 10-year-period before the probe into its tax practices was launched, since it was given \"significant advantage\" over its rivals. \nApparently, Apple created Irish subsidiaries that owned most of its intellectual properties. Every time the company sells a product, the Irish subsidiaries get paid for the use of Apple's IPs. And thanks to the company's agreement with Ireland, Apple was only paying a 1 percent tax rate on European profits that became as low as .005 percent in 2014. The Commission ordered Apple to pay back the €13.1 billion in taxes it owed from between 2003 and 2014, with an interest of €1.2 billion on top. \nIn 2018, the company transferred €14.3 billion to an escrow account as it appealed the Commission's ruling. The EU's General Court ruled in Apple's favor in 2020, explaining that there wasn't enough evidence to show that the company had broken the bloc's rules. But in 2024, the European Court of Justice overturned that decision and confirmed the Commission's original ruling in 2016. \nAs The Irish Times has reported, the funds continued depreciating in value since it was deposited into escrow until 2023. It only managed to regain €470 million within 16 months before the account's closure in May, thanks to higher interest rates and investments with higher yields. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/apples-%E2%82%AC143-billion-irish-tax-break-case-is-officially-over-113755771.html?src=rss",

Pick any category you can think of and Netflix probably has something that will fit the bill, including original programming. Plus, new content is released every week and as a worldwide service, Netflix is consistently adding movies and TV shows from around the globe that can change the viewing experience in ways you may not have considered (Are you sure you’re not into K-Dramas, Finnish detective thrillers or British home improvement shows? That doesn’t mean it’s always simple to choose something to watch, but when it comes to swapping profiles or simply picking up where you left off, it doesn’t get better than this. If you’re heading off the grid — or onto a plane — then you can easily download most (but not all) of its content to watch on your iOS or Android device. The other thing to keep in mind is that maybe if you’ve let your account lapse, the service that exists now is very different from what you would’ve seen two years ago, or five, or ten. Remaining the dominant player in subscription streaming has required adjustments to stay on top with a changing mix of content and plans to choose from. In the US, there are three levels of Netflix you can subscribe to. All of them include unlimited access to the same content, work on the same devices and you can cancel or pause them at any time. The difference between Standard ($15.50 per month) and Premium ($23 per month) comes down to picture quality and the amount of simultaneous streams allowed."

    "summary": "The best soundbars can completely transform your TV setup, turning flat, lifeless audio into something that actually sounds cinematic. Whether you're watching blockbuster movies, listening to music or gaming, a good soundbar delivers clearer vocals, deep bass and better overall playback than most built-in TV speakers ever could.In 2025, there’s a soundbar for every kind of home entertainment setup — from compact all-in-one units to full surround systems with subwoofers and rear speakers. Some prioritize simplicity and sleek design, while others are packed with immersive features like Dolby Atmos and smart voice controls. No matter your budget or your space, we’ve picked the best soundbars you can buy right now to help elevate your audio experience.\nTable of contents\n\nThe post-CES soundbar outlook for 2025\nBest soundbars for 2025\nWhat to look for in a soundbar \nOther soundbars we tested\nBest soundbar FAQs\n\nThe post-CES soundbar outlook for 2025\nI typically come out of CES with a pretty clear understanding of the new soundbars that are coming for the year, but that wasn’t exactly the case in 2025. LG decided to carry over its most premium soundbars from 2024, but it will add the compact S20A this year. The company only previewed the model at CES, so full specs are still forthcoming. \nSamsung will once again keep the same overall design and features for its top-end Q990 soundbar. However, the company is adding a few new tools and it drastically reduced the size of the wireless subwoofer that comes in the box. Samsung does have one new model for 2025, the QS700F, that’s designed to sit on a table or automatically adjust to being mounted flat on a wall. Details are scarce on that soundbar for now and I anticipate a full spec sheet when the company is really to sell it.\nOf the big three TV companies, Sony is the only one that didn’t announce any home theater gear at CES. The company has decided to focus mainly on its automotive efforts at the show recently, leaving TV and audio announcements for later in the year. The company debuted multiple soundbar options in 2024 and a four-speaker setup for the living room in the Bravia Quad. That said, it wouldn’t surprise me if Sony released new soundbars later in the year since its most recent models were only announced last April.\nOne company I would keep an eye on is Sennheiser. The original Ambeo model is nearly six years old and could use a refresh. The company has added medium and mini options to the Ambeo lineup since then, but it would be nice to see a refined version of the largest model too. The original Ambeo soundbar is huge, so no matter how good it sounds, it will always be a tough sell for some people.\nAlthough I think it’s less likely, it’s also possible that Sonos has new soundbars this year. While the company’s next device will likely be the rumored set-top streaming box, the Sound Motion tech inside the Arc Ultra would offer a big improvement to bass performance in compact models like the Beam and Ray. The company may bring Sound Motion to standalone speakers first, but it’s destined for those smaller soundbars eventually.\nThe best soundbars for 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat to look for in a soundbar\nFeatures\nWhen it comes to features, the more you pay the more you're going to get in your new audio system. Most affordable options ($150 or less) will improve your television's audio quality, but that's about it. Step into the $300 to $400 range and you'll find all-in-one soundbars with things like built-in voice control, wireless connectivity, Google Chromecast, AirPlay 2 and even Android TV. They're all helpful when you want to avoid looking for the remote control, but the best playback quality is usually only in the top tier and the formats those premium soundbar systems support. I’m talking about things like Dolby Atmos, DTS:X and other high-resolution audio standards — essentials if you’re building a truly cinematic home entertainment setup. And not all Atmos soundbars are equal, so you'll need to look at the finer details carefully before you break into the savings account. If you're looking for one of the best Dolby Atmos soundbars, size, channels and subwoofer options will be important factors to consider. Some models even include a dedicated subwoofer to enhance bass performance, bringing an extra punch to action scenes and soundtracks.\nPorts\n\n\n\n\nThis is a big one. A lot of the more affordable soundbars are limited when it comes to connectivity options. They either offer an optical port or one HDMI jack and, if you're lucky, both. Things get slightly better in the mid-range section, but that's not always the case. The Sonos Beam, for example, is $449, but only has a single HDMI port. Even at the higher-end, the $899 Sonos Arc still only has one HDMI port. If you plan to connect multiple devices like a set-top box, gaming laptop or console directly to your soundbar for the best audio experience, you’ll want an option with at least two HDMI (eARC) inputs. HDMI connections are critical for supporting Dolby Atmos and Dolby Digital audio formats, as well as high-res passthrough for HDR and 8K/4K content.\nChannels\nAnother big thing you’ll want to pay attention to when looking for the best soundbar is channels. That’s the 2.1, 7.1.2 or other decimal number that companies include in product descriptions. The first figure corresponds to the number of channels. A two would just be left and right while a more robust Atmos system, especially one with rear surround speakers, could be five or seven (left, right, center and upward). The second number refers to the dedicated subwoofer, so if your new soundbar comes with one or has them built in, you’ll see one here. The third numeral is up-firing speakers, important for the immersive effect of Dolby Atmos. Not all Atmos-enabled units have them, but if they do, the third number will tell you how many are in play and how they contribute to the overall soundstage.\nWireless\n\n\n\n\nMost soundbars these days offer either Bluetooth, Wi-Fi or both. When it comes to Wi-Fi, that connectivity affords you luxuries like voice control (either built-in or with a separate device), Chromecast, Spotify Connect and AirPlay 2. Depending on your preferences, you might be able to live without some of these. For me, AirPlay 2 and Chromecast are essentials, but the rest I can live without. Those two give me the ability to beam music and podcasts from my go-to apps without having to settle for — or struggle with — a Bluetooth connection. For instance, Sonos speakers often offer seamless integration with iOS devices, making it easy to connect and stream music wirelessly. If you’re looking for a wireless speaker that can enhance your TV setup while also offering flexibility for audio throughout the house, it's worth considering a multi-room system.\nSize\nThis one might seem obvious but humor me for a minute. Nothing is more soul-crushing than getting a pricey soundbar in your living room only to discover you have to rearrange everything to find a spot for it. This was my plight when the Sennheiser Ambeo Soundbar arrived at my door. Yes, that speaker is absurdly large (and heavy), and most soundbars aren't nearly as big. I learned a valuable lesson: Make sure the space where you want to put a soundbar will accommodate the thing you're about to spend hundreds (if not thousands) of dollars on.\nBasically, it all comes down to the TV you have (or are planning to get) and what the primary goal is for your living-room audio. Is it ease of use? Do you want the best possible sound from a single speaker or speaker/sub combo? Do you just want to be able to actually hear your TV better? Or do you want a full home entertainment experience with crisp vocals, thunderous deep bass, and immersive surround system audio?\nBy paying attention to each of those areas, you should have a good idea of what to look for in a soundbar, soundbar/subwoofer combo, Dolby Digital system or a more robust setup. With that said, we've put numerous products through their paces at Engadget and have a few favorites for best soundbar at various price points to get you started.\nOther soundbars we tested\nSonos Arc\nThere’s no doubt that the Arc is Sonos’ best-sounding soundbar, but it’s also the company’s most expensive. With a new model based on the Arc rumored to be on the way, it’s difficult to recommend this product over the likes of Samsung and Sony. The Arc works well as both a soundbar and a speaker, and the device will fit in nicely with other Sonos gear you might already have for a multiroom setup. It only has one HDMI port though, where much of the competition allows you to connect streaming and gaming devices directly to their soundbars.\nSennheiser Ambeo Soundbar Plus\nI don’t think Sennheiser’s medium-sized model offers enough to stand out from the more powerful Ambeo Soundbar Max or the Ambeo Soundbar Mini. The Mini is more affordable and does a solid job with immersive audio in its own right. Like the rest of the Ambeo lineup, there’s no option for satellite speakers as you can only add a subwoofer to the soundbars. However, the Ambeo Soundbar Plus does have RCA input, so you can use it with a turntable if you’re into vinyl.\nBest soundbar FAQs\nIs a soundbar better than speakers?\nIt really depends on what you’re after. A soundbar is definitely a simpler, more compact solution compared to a full speaker setup. If you want better sound than your TV’s built-in setup but don’t want to deal with multiple speakers and wires everywhere, a soundbar is probably the way to go. Some soundbars can even deliver impressive surround sound effects, thanks to features like Dolby Atmos and virtual audio technology. \nHowever, if you’re an audiophile or want true surround sound for an at-home theater experience, a multi-speaker setup with a receiver, surround speakers and subwoofer will give you a richer soundstage and more control over your experience.\nWhat connection do I need for a soundbar?\nMost modern soundbars connect to your TV via HDMI ARC or eARC, which is the easiest and best option for achieving high-quality audio. If your TV supports this, all you need is an HDMI cable, and you’ll get not only great sound but also some extra features like controlling the soundbar with your TV remote. \nIf HDMI ARC isn’t an option on your TV, you can use an optical cable, which also delivers solid audio quality. Some soundbars even offer Bluetooth or Wi-Fi connections for streaming music, and a few still have a 3.5mm aux jack for connecting to older devices. \nDo all soundbars come with subwoofers?\nNot all soundbars come with subwoofers, but many do or at least offer one as an optional add-on that you can purchase separately. A subwoofer is what gives you that deep, booming bass, so if you like action movies or want a fuller sound for music, having one can make a big difference. Some soundbars have a built-in subwoofer, but these generally don’t provide the same punch as a separate one. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/speakers/best-soundbars-143041791.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Welcome to Video Games Weekly on Engadget. Expect a new story every Monday or Tuesday, broken into two parts. The first is a space for short essays and ramblings about video game trends and related topics from me, Jess Conditt, a reporter who's covered the industry for more than 13 years. The second contains the video game stories from the past week that you need to know about, including some headlines from outside of Engadget.\nPlease enjoy — and I'll see you next week.\n\nIf I end up reading one more story about how fantastic Death Stranding 2 is so long as you skip the cutscenes, I’m gonna hurl. At what point during 10 hours of cinematic interstitials do we collectively put the controller down and say, actually, this isn’t a great game? Not because the game parts aren’t any good — they’re pretty fabulous, in fact — but because a significant portion of the experience isn’t actually interactive at all. When does it become more accurate to describe a Hideo Kojima project as a CGI movie with moments of interactivity, rather than as a video game first?\nI’m not actually attempting to solve the “video game of Theseus” riddle right now, but it’s a conversation that’s been on my mind, given recent headlines. Death Stranding 2 reviews are in, Neil Druckmann is out at HBO and returning to Naughty Dog full-time, and Emmy nominations arrived with 18 nods for video game adaptations. Meanwhile, layoffs are rocking the gaming industry yet again, with thousands fired at Xbox this month, alongside multiple studio closures and game cancellations. One of the most surprising titles to get the ax was Project Blackbird, a promising-sounding MMO from Elder Scrolls studio ZeniMax Online. Blackbird was reportedly canceled in favor of allocating resources to the development of Fallout 5, a series with mainstream clout following the success of Amazon’s Fallout TV show in 2024.\nThe convergence of video games and Hollywood is not a new talking point — even for me — but it’s only grown more relevant with time. Sony in particular is leaning hard into a cross-media strategy with notable investments in television, anime and film adaptations of its video game franchises, and it just published Kojima Productions’ Death Stranding 2, which serves as a lightning rod for this entire conversation.\nKojima is easy to pick on because he’s been so vocal about his desire to make movies, and fittingly, his games have only grown more cinematic over the years. Death Stranding and its sequel are stacked with mainstream Hollywood actors (and Kojima’s favorite directors) across hours of drawn-out, non-interactive cutscenes. His next two projects, OD and Physint, are both described as having A-list casts and “blurring the boundaries between film and games.”\nI’m a big fan of experimental horror games, and I deeply appreciate Kojima’s eye for building tension and sneaky action sequences, but I’m hesitant to get excited about OD and Physint. The deeper Kojima dives into the world of Hollywood, the more he loses me. I don’t download, install and boot up a video game to watch a movie instead, and I don’t find it impressive when an interactive product is defined by cinematic terms. The constraints of filmmaking are vastly different than those of video game development, and it sucks to watch a talented creator try to force video games to conform to the boundaries of movies or TV, rather than exploring the mechanics that make interactive art so uniquely powerful. I feel like Kojima sees cinema as the goal, not video games specifically, and this perspective breaks my little pixelated heart.\nIt’s particularly painful in an era of raging instability for the video game industry. It’s difficult to see so much money and creative talent being thrown at projects that end up feeling more like movies than games, at a time when it’s increasingly difficult for fresh and original AAA projects to make it to market. Video games have not been maxed out as an art form — there’s far more to discover in terms of mechanics, visuals, haptics and immersive interaction systems, and there are more stories that can only be told with these specific tools. Viewing game development through the lens of filmmaking diminishes everything that makes this medium so powerful. The only Hollywood trait the games industry should imitate is its powerful and functional unions.\nI enjoy things that exist in the gray space between definitions; in fact, I often prefer them. What I don’t enjoy is misguided emulation that’s sold to an audience as innovation. In the end, I guess what I’m really saying is… I’m still not over PT.\n\nThe news\nKing developers were the architects of their own demise\nOne of the most eyebrow-raising details of Microsoft’s sweeping layoffs earlier this month was the fact that King, the studio behind Candy Crush, was included in the firings. King is historically a money-printing machine with high per-employee returns, which tends to insulate it from layoffs, but this time around at least 200 people were let go from the studio. As it turns out, a number of fired developers spent the past few years training AI systems to do their jobs, which just adds a layer of shittiness to an already crappy situation.\nBest Buy will have more Switch 2 units on Thursday\nHas the FOMO gotten to you yet? After denying that you wanted a Switch 2 for a few noble and self-righteous weeks, have you cracked and admitted that you actually, really want one? Great — then get yourself to Best Buy on Thursday, July 17, when the company will restock its supply of Switch 2 consoles in all stores. This coincides with the release of Donkey Kong Banaza, too.\nA small update on Ken Levine’s Judas (sung like Lady Gaga)\nI’ve had my eye on Judas, the BioShocky FPS from Ken Levine’s Ghost Story Games, since it was revealed in 2022, and I lowkey love how little we still know about it today. That said, I’m happily devouring every bit of information about Judas, and the latest nugget comes from Levine himself in an interview with classic game publisher Nightdive Studios. With Judas, Ghost Story is focused on \"telling the story and transporting the player somewhere,\" rather than building live-service or microtransaction features, Levine said. As he put it, “You buy the game and you get the whole thing. There's no online component. There's no live service.”\nThere’s also no release date for Judas yet.\n\nSummer Games Done Quick can’t stop raising millions for charity\nThe crazy kids at Summer Games Done Quick have done it once again and raised literal millions of dollars for Doctors Without Borders in a single weekend, simply by playing video games in silly ways without stopping. SGDQ 2025 wrapped up on Sunday with a total donation pool of $2,436,614. The organization's next event is another edition of Flame Fatales, a speedrunning showcase featuring women and femmes that runs from September 7 to 14. We’ll see you there.\nOusted Subnautica 2 studio bosses are suing Krafton\nThe well of Subnautica 2 drama runs deep. Earlier in July the heads of Subnatica 2 studio Unknown Worlds Entertainment — Charlie Cleveland, Ted Gill and Max McGuire — were ousted by the team’s parent company, Krafton, and the game’s early access release was delayed to 2026. What’s more, Bloomberg reported that the studio had been in line for a $250 million bonus if it had met certain financial goals by the end of the year, but those largely hinged on an early access release. Cleveland said on social media that Subnautica 2 was ready for early access, and Krafton responded to the whole shebang by accusing the fired developers of abandoning their responsibilities as studio heads. Cleveland and others are now apparently filing a lawsuit against Krafton. GamesIndustry.biz has a comprehensive timeline of the Subnautica 2 controversy right here.\nAdditional reading\n\nKris Holt’s weekly indie game roundup\nGhost of Yōtei's lo-fi beats mode sums up the very best and very worst of this very weird series by Chris Tapsell at Eurogamer\n\n\nHave a tip for Jessica?

    "summary": "Xbox's \"Stream your own game\" feature continues to expand. You can now use your PC to play supported games you own on Xbox. (The games stream from the cloud, not your console.) You'll need to be an Xbox Insider and Game Pass Ultimate subscriber to use it.\nThe PC launch follows the feature's arrival earlier this year on other devices. Already supported were Xbox consoles, TVs, browser-based devices (including mobile) and Meta Quest headsets.\nThe idea is the latest chapter in Microsoft's mission to make Xbox software more device-agnostic. Hop on whatever device is available, and start playing without waiting for installations. That makes sense from a business perspective, given Sony's commanding lead in their two-way console race. It's increasingly more about selling Game Pass subscriptions than fighting a losing hardware battle.\nCD Projekt Red\nMicrosoft lists over 250 supported games. Standouts include Baldur's Gate 3, Star Wars Outlaws, Cyberpunk 2077, Hogwarts Legacy, Balatro and a whole mess of Assassin's Creed entries. Microsoft says it will add more over time.\nThe company says the collection includes some console-only titles. But you'll be hard-pressed to find many that aren't already available (natively) on PC. On the other hand, this method could free up storage and save you the hassle of downloading them.\nThere are some caveats. You'll need to own digital copies of those you want to stream to your PC. (Physical copies won't cut it.) The feature is only available in the 28 countries where Xbox Cloud Gaming is supported. You'll also need a Game Pass Ultimate subscription, which costs $20 per month. If you're interested, you'll first need to sign up for the Xbox Insider program, which is free.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/xboxs-stream-your-own-game-feature-now-extends-to-pc-204049103.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Discoveries keep pouring out of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Researchers observed an unusual cluster, which they dubbed the Infinity Galaxy. It appears to support a leading theory on how some supermassive black holes form.\nAlthough \"Infinity Galaxy\" sounds like a place Thanos would hang out, it merely describes its appearance. Two compact, red nuclei, each surrounded by a ring, give the cluster the shape of an infinity symbol.\nWhat's inside is more interesting. (After all, this is a much lower-res image than some of the eye candy the Webb telescope has yielded.) Researchers believe the Infinity Galaxy formed when two spiral galaxies (the nuclei in the image) collided. Between them lies a young supermassive black hole within an enormous cloud of gas.\nSupermassive black holes can range from hundreds of thousands of times the size of our sun to millions or billions of times its size. This one is about a million times as big.\nThe Infinity Galaxy, overlaid with a contour map indicating the supermassive black holeNASA / JWST\nThe Infinity Galaxy lends weight to the direct collapse theory of black hole formation. As you probably know, most black holes form when massive stars collapse. The presence of supermassive ones is harder to explain.\nOne theory proposes that smaller black holes merge over time to form a supermassive one. The problem there is that some supermassive black holes formed soon after the Big Bang. So, scientists think some supermassive ones form instead from the collapse of gas clouds, much like the one we see here. The Infinity Galaxy may be the best evidence yet for that direct collapse hypothesis.\nOne of the paper's lead authors summarized the findings. \"By looking at the data from the Infinity Galaxy, we think we've pieced together a story of how a direct collapse could have happened here,\" Pieter van Dokkum wrote in a press release. \"Two disk galaxies collide, forming the ring structures of stars that we see. During the collision, the gas within these two galaxies shocks and compresses. This compression might just be enough to form a dense knot, which then collapsed into a black hole.\"\nThe team can't definitively confirm the theory from their current data. \"But we can say that these new data strengthen the case that we're seeing a newborn black hole, while eliminating some of the competing explanations,\" van Dokkum added. \"We will continue to pore through the data and investigate these possibilities.\"This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/science/space/webb-spots-infinity-galaxy-that-sheds-light-on-black-hole-formation-183900161.html?src=rss",

These include indie hits like Wheel World and blockbusters like Robocop: Rogue City. Let's get into it.\n\nRobocop: Rogue City came as a huge surprise back in 2023. A game based on a decades-old sci-fi franchise by a relatively unknown developer? It should have been a train wreck. Instead, it's a solid 3D action title that perfectly captures the vibe of the original film. This is a must-play for children of the 1980s. It'll be available on July 17 for subscribers on all tiers.\n\nGrounded 2 looks to be a fantastic take on the \"shrunken teens navigating a yard\" genre, as first pioneered in the film Honey, I Shrunk the Kids. The first game was great and Obsidian looks to be upping the ante here in nearly every way, with a larger focus on story, a more immersive world and insects to ride around on. This is a day one Game Pass release, which happens on July 29. It'll only be playable for PC and Ultimate subscribers.\n\nThe Annapurna-published Wheel World is finally heading our way on July 23, and it's a day one Game Pass release. This is an open-world bicycle sim with gorgeous cel-shaded graphics. The title promises \"impressive vistas, hidden secrets and races that will test your skills.\" It'll be available for Ultimate and PC subscribers.\n\nWuchang: Fallen Feathers is another day one release, with availability on July 24. This is a Souls-like action RPG set in the final days of the Ming Dynasty. The combat looks absolutely brutal. Again, only Ultimate and PC subscribers will have access to the game.\nThose are just the titles that caught my interest. The shooter High On Life returns to the platform today and the survival horror adventure My Friendly Neighborhood drops on July 17. The prison-based RPG Back to the Dawn will be playable on July 18 and the survival crafting title Abiotic Factor releases on July 22. As always, Game Pass remains one heck of a deal.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xboxs-second-batch-of-game-pass-additions-for-july-includes-grounded-2-and-wheel-world-164450594.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Sony just surprised the photography world by unveiling the RX1R III, a fixed-lens 35mm full-frame compact camera. Coming nearly ten years after the RX1R II, it has a 61MP Exmor R sensor along with Sony's latest image processing technology that promises low noise and high dynamic range. \nApart from all the new tech, the RX1R III is smaller and more streamlined than before and considerably lighter at 17 ounces than its main competition, Leica's Q3 and the Fujifilm GFX100RF. With that, it's designed to be a \"carrying around\" camera for street photographers, serious amateurs and others.  \nThat small size is due in part to the Zeiss Sonnar T 35mm f2 lens that sits partly inside the body. While more compact than before, it has the same optics as the last model and offers high levels of sharpness and color rendering, according to Sony. It comes with a macro ring that enables users to get as close as 20cm to subjects and feature's Sony's new \"Step Crop Shooting\" function that allows 35mm, 50mm and 70mm focal lengths by cropping into the sensor, just like the GFX100RF can do with a similar button. \n\n\n\n\n  Sony\n \n\nThe RX1R II has up to 15 stops of dynamic range thanks to the high-res sensor and image processing engine. It also features an anti-reflection coating and no optical low-pass filter to boost image quality, though that can cause some moire and other artifacts. Shooting speeds aren't quick at just 5 fps, though it's obviously not designed for sports.\nThe electronic viewfinder is middling with 2.36 million dots and 0.7x magnification, though the rear display offers a decent 2.4 million dots of resolution. However, unlike the one on the previous model that tilted out and up, it's fixed in order to save weight and size. It also lacks any in-body or optical stabilization, relying solely on electronic shake reduction. \nWith Sony's latest Bionz XR and AI processors, it promises accurate tracking of \"subjects, human bodies, heads and the position of eyes,\" Sony said, even if their faces aren't visible. It uses 693 phase-detection AF points covering around 78 percent of the image, just like Sony's A7R V. \n\n\nIt's not nearly as powerful as the A7R V for video, but can still handle 4K 30 fps video with 10-bit 4:2:2 color sampling, along with 1080p video at up to 120 fps. No log mode is available, but you do get the log-like S-Cinetone that boosts dynamic range a bit. Other features include a single SDXC UHS II slot, a mic input (but not headphone jack), a microHDMI port and a USB-C input. \nThe R1XR III is much more expensive than the RX1R II was at launch. It'll go on pre-order soon for $5,100, with shipping set to start on July 31st. Sony is also offering a handful of accessories (also expensive), including a $300 (!) thumb grip, $250 body case and $200 lens hood (!!). \n\n\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cameras/sonys-61mp-rx1r-iii-fixed-lens-compact-camera-is-finally-here-after-a-ten-year-wait-152707087.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Insta360 has launched a firmware upgrade and new accessories for its X5 360-degree camera as part of what it calls the Insta360 Summer Update. Key new features include \"AdaptiveTone\" to improve dual camera exposure, a new \"Ultra Battery\" for longer recording times, an ND filter set and custom-designed lenses. \n\"It can be a struggle for dual-lens cameras like X5 to balance the exposure across both lenses,\" the company explained. To fix this issue it came up with AdaptiveTone, which independently records light data for both lenses in order to preserve highlight and shadow detail across the entire spherical image. Then, in automatically adjusts the exposure based on the perspective you choose, supposedly resulting in more natural-looking footage. It works with both 360 video at 8K 30 fps and 5.7K 30fps along with flat PureVideo.  \nAnother key update is for PureVideo, allowing it work single lens mode rather than just in 360 mode as before. That will allow creators to capture low-light footage with reduced noise and improved color fidelity in both flat and spherical modes. \nBattery life was another key target. The X5 now supports Endurance Mode in 8K, allowing nearly two hours of continuous recording while improving endurance mode at 5.7K 24 fps with a boost from 185 to 208 minutes. Should you need even more performance in that regard, Insta360 is selling a new $50 Ultra Battery that boosts runtime by up to 17 percent to just under four hours max. \n\n\n\n\n  Mat Smith for Engadget\n \n\nAnother new accessory is X5 ND filters that give creators more options in bright lighting conditions. The kit includes ND16, ND32 and ND64 filters, letting you reduce shutter speeds to create natural motion blur for activities like mountain biking and motorcycle footage. Plus, Insta360 is offering an X5 custom replacement lens kit with pre-made patterns, AI artwork or your own images, to swap out with the standard lenses. \nMotorcycle creators are getting some extra love, too. Enhancements include immersive stabilization that preserves some natural shake to enhance the feeling of speed, along with Sena headset integration that allows start/stop recording and voice commands for hands-free operation. It also introduced a GPS preview remote with a built-in mic that combines camera control, live preview, GPS data recording and a noise canceling mic. Finally, the Plate Blur feature automatically obscures your license plate in footage, saving you the trouble of doing that manually. \nOther updates include new diving accessories and software updates with a new Invisible Dive Case Pro and buoyancy control accessory, along with an updated AquaVision 3.0 algorithm that analyzes underwater footage and provides a selection of color adjustments to best match the shot. You can also connect the X5 to a Suunto dive computer so you can bake your diving data right into the footage. \nFinally, Insta360 introduced updates to its Studio editing software like improved export speeds, background exports and improvements to the AI Stitching algorithm. And now, you can preview video files in their folder on your computer without the need to open them in Studio, saving time. The software updates, along with all the new accessories, are now available on Insta360's website. \n\n\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cameras/insta360s-x5-cam-update-brings-nd-filters-a-giant-battery-and-improved-exposure-150007247.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Google has closed a $3 billion deal to secure 3,000 megawatts of hydroelectric power, as it looks to meet the data demands of its growing AI and cloud computing platforms by harnessing low-cost clean energy. Brookfield Asset Management's renewables division says that its deal with Google is the largest deal of its kind for hydroelectricity. The first phase of this deal will provide Google with 670MW of carbon-free electricity from Brookfield’s Holtwood and Safe Harbor plants in Pennsylvania.\nThe Hydro Framework Agreement (HFA) allows Google to upgrade or develop the existing facilities as it sees fit in an ongoing commitment to adding more power to the grid. At the outset, Google’s efforts will largely be focused on the PJM, the largest grid in the US with 65 million customers, which is currently struggling to keep up with the data demands of big tech’s seemingly insatiably power-hungry AI projects. In time, the new partners will have the option of expanding into other regions in the country. Google said in a statement that it was dedicated to \"responsibly growing the digital infrastructure that powers daily life for people, communities and businesses.\"\nGoogle’s latest energy deal comes in the same week that AI rival Meta said it will spend hundreds of billions of dollars on a number of gigwatt-sized data centers, as part of its quest to create better-than-human-level \"superintelligence\" in all of its AI domains. The new campuses will be among the largest on earth, with the first to arrive being the Ohio-based Prometheus at some point next year.\nA typical data center consumes around 500,000 gallons of water each day, but the emerging AI-focused complexes being built by tech giants could reportedly push this figure into the millions, as recently reported by The New York Times. When the volume of water needed to power these facilities eclipses what is readily available, local communities often bear the brunt through rising prices and potential water shortages in the future.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/google-spends-%C2%A33-billion-on-securing-energy-for-its-data-centers-and-ai-expansion-145145966.html?src=rss",

That way, users won't have to re-enter their birthdays every time they try to access restricted content. The announcement also said that Persona will only be keeping users' photos for seven days and will not be able to see their Reddit information, such as their posts and the subreddits they visit. \nIf a user is under 18, Reddit will hide restricted content from them and will limit ads in sensitive categories, like gambling. They will no longer be able to view sexually explicit content, anything that encourages suicide and disordered eating, as well as anything that incites hatred against other people based on their race, religion, sex, sexual orientation, disability and gender. Reddit will also restrict anything that encourages violence and any post that depicts \"real or realistic serious violence against a person, an animal, or a fictional creature\" for minors. They won't be able to see posts encouraging challenges that are highly likely to result in serious injury, along with posts encouraging people to ingest harmful substances. Content that shames people's body types and other physical features will be restricted, as well. \nUsers outside the UK will not be affected by the new rule, but Reddit said that it may need to verify the ages of people in other regions if they adopt similar laws. Reddit also said that it \"would like to be able to confirm whether [users] are a human being or not\" in the age of AI and will have more to announce about that later. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/reddit-begins-age-verification-checks-for-uk-users-134516723.html?src=rss",

Adobe Creative Cloud is the industry standard in this space but the entire suite of programs is quite expensive at $70 per month. Thankfully, Adobe has education pricing for students that drops the entire creative suite to $30 per month for the first year. That includes the big programs like Photoshop CC and Illustrator CC along with Lightroom CC, Premiere Pro CC, Adobe XD and more. After your first year, the monthly cost increases. While not ideal, it’s still more affordable for students than it is for industry professionals.

    "summary": "If you're looking to get fit, sleep better or just keep a closer eye on your health, a fitness wearable is a great place to start. Whether you're into intense workouts or just want to hit your step goal each day, the best fitness trackers available today can offer loads of helpful features, from sleep tracking and resting heart rate monitoring to built-in GPS and stress tracking. Some are even subtle enough to wear 24/7, like smart rings, while others double as stylish smartwatches.There are great options out there for beginners as well as more advanced users, and the variety of features means there’s something for every lifestyle and budget. In this guide, we’ll walk you through the best fitness trackers you can buy right now, and explain who each one is best suited for.\nTable of contents\n\nBest fitness trackers and watches for 2025\nWhat do fitness trackers do best?\nWhen to get a smartwatch instead\nOther fitness trackers we tested\nFitness tracker FAQs\n\nBest fitness trackers and watches for 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat do fitness trackers do best?\nThe answer seems simple: Fitness wearables are best at monitoring exercise, be it a 10-minute walk around the block or that half marathon you’ve been diligently training for. Obviously, smartwatches can help you reach your fitness goals too, but there are some areas where fitness bands and smart rings have proven to be the best buy: focus, design, better battery life, durability and price. \nWhen I say “focus,” I’m alluding to the fact that fitness trackers are made to track activity well; anything else is extra. They often don’t have the bells and whistles that smartwatches do, which could distract from their advanced health tracking abilities — things like all-day resting heart rate monitoring, stress tracking, and even detailed sleep tracker insights. They also tend to have fewer sensors and internal components, which keeps them smaller and lighter. Fitness trackers are also a better option for those who just want a less conspicuous gadget on their wrists all day.\nBattery life tends to be better on fitness trackers, too. While most smartwatches last one to two days on a single charge, fitness bands offer between five and seven days of battery life — and that’s with all-day and all-night use even with sleep tracking features enabled. Many fitness trackers also slot nicely into your existing ecosystem, syncing seamlessly with your smartphone, other fitness apps and cloud storage to keep all your data in one place.\nWhen it comes to price point, there’s no competition. Most worthwhile smartwatches start at $175 to $200, but you can get a solid smart band starting at $70. That makes them a great entry point for beginners who want to track their progress without committing to a full smartwatch. Yes, more expensive bands and smart rings exist (and we recommend a few here), but you’ll find more options under $150 in the fitness tracker space than in the smartwatch space.\nWhen to get a smartwatch instead\nIf you need a bit more from your wearable and don’t want to be limited to a fitness or activity tracker, a smartwatch may be the best buy for you. There are things like on-watch apps, alerts and even more robust fitness features that smartwatches have and the best fitness trackers don’t. You can use one to control smart home appliances, set timers and reminders, check weather reports and more. Some smartwatches let you choose which apps you want to receive alerts from, and the options go beyond just call and text notifications. Just make sure your smartwatch is compatible with your Android or iPhone, however, before purchasing, as not all of them work with both operating systems.\nBut the extra fitness features are arguably the most important thing to think about when deciding between a fitness tracker and a smartwatch. The latter devices tend to be larger, giving them more space for things like GPS, barometers, onboard music storage and more. While you can find built-in GPS on select fitness trackers, it’s not common.\nIf you’re someone who’s seriously training — say for a race or an endurance challenge — a dedicated running watch may be worth considering. These often provide more in-depth cardio analytics, recovery insights, and real-time pace data that go beyond what standard trackers can deliver.\nOther fitness trackers we've tested\nFitbit Inspire 3\nThe Fitbit Inspire 3 strips out all the luxury features from the Charge 6 and keeps only the essential tracking features. You won’t get built-in GPS tracking or Fitbit Pay or Spotify control but you do get solid activity tracking, automatic workout detection, smartphone alerts and plenty more. The updated version has a sleeker design and includes a color touch display and connected GPS, the latter of which lets you track pace and distance while you run or bike outside while you have your phone with you. When compared to the Charge 6, the Inspire 3 is more fashionable, too. Its interchangeable bands let you switch up the look and feel of your tracker whenever you want, and it’s slim enough to blend in with other jewelry you might be wearing. We were also impressed by its multi-day battery life: Fitbit promises up to 10 days on a single charge, and that checked out for us. After four days of round-the-clock use, the Inspire 3 still had 66 percent battery left to go.\nFitness tracker FAQs\nHow long do fitness tracker batteries last?\nThe battery life of fitness trackers can vary depending on the model and its features. On average, most fitness trackers last between five to seven days on a single charge. Basic models with limited features could stretch up to 10 days or more. However, more advanced trackers with features like continuous heart rate monitoring, GPS, or always-on displays may need recharging after one to three days. If you're using GPS or streaming music through your fitness tracker, you'll find that this drains the battery faster. By using these features less, or turning them off, you'll extend battery life. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wearables/best-fitness-trackers-133053484.html?src=rss",
    "full_text": "Whether you're into intense workouts or just want to hit your step goal each day, the best fitness trackers available today can offer loads of helpful features, from sleep tracking and resting heart rate monitoring to built-in GPS and stress tracking. If you’re looking for a well-rounded activity tracker, the Garmin vívosmart 5 has it all. More detailed insights are also viewable on your smartphone through the Mi companion app. When the Band 8 is on your wrist, it makes it easy to set up workout goals related to time, distance or calories burned per session for activities like deadlifting or skateboarding. Yes, more expensive bands and smart rings exist (and we recommend a few here), but you’ll find more options under $150 in the fitness tracker space than in the smartwatch space.

    "summary": "It’s been a little over a year since Form released its second-generation smart swim goggles into the world. Since then, the company has been working on a way to ensure its headgear is even more attractive to swimmers who like to get out in the rough. Today, it’s announcing the Smart Swim 2 Pro, a modest upgrade on its predecessor with a focus on durability.\nThe 2 Pro’s lenses are now made of Gorilla Glass 3, which adds a gram or two more weight but should keep them scratch-free for far longer. Given the amount of open-water swimmers that use Form’s goggles, having faith that your lenses can take nature’s elbows is probably worth it.\nIf you’ve ever used a pair of regular goggles for a long time, you might notice how the anti-fog coating starts to wear off. Especially if you, like me, absentmindedly commit the sin of wiping the inside of their goggles with a finger when your view is obscured. Form may be proud of its current anti-fog coating, but realized there was a better way to keep the lenses clear for longer.\nConsequently, the 2 Pro comes with a bottle of anti-fog spray that users need to apply before a swim. This isn’t a way of squeezing more cash out of the user base, however, as the company is proud to admit it’s just baby shampoo diluted with water. But Form has tested the correct ratio for optimal application and there are markings on the bottle showing you what you need to refill.\nAt the same time, Form is rolling out new features for its premium subscribers, including more data-driven program planning and more tips on where you need to improve. The company also revealed that its premium features are paying off, with swimmers seeing 1.4 times the gains in speed compared to the users who use the hardware alone.\nThe Form Smart Swim 2 Pro is available to buy July 15 for $329 in the US, $449 in Canada and €329 in Europe.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wearables/form-makes-its-smart-swimming-goggles-tougher-with-gorilla-glass-lenses-060019264.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "ByteDance, the parent company of TikTok, is reportedly working on mixed reality goggles, The Information reports. The in-development device is designed to layer digital objects over your view of the real world, and is supposed to compete directly with Meta's upcoming mixed reality products.\nThe goggles are being built by ByteDance's virtual reality startup Pico, the creators of the Pico 4 VR headset. Pico's past products have attempted to match Meta's Quest headsets in terms of features, but these new goggles apparently represent a different approach (albeit one still positioned as an alternative to Meta). Rather than a bulky headset, the goggles are supposed to be small and light, about the size of the Bigscreen Beyond VR headset, which weighs 0.28 pounds. Pico is keeping the device lightweight by offloading most of the computing work to a puck that's connected to the goggles over a wire. Meta's prototype Orion AR glasses used a wireless puck for a similar weight-saving purpose when the company demoed them in November 2024.\nPico is also reportedly working on building \"specialized chips for the device that will process data from its sensors to minimize the lag or latency between what a user sees in AR and their physical movements,\" The Information writes.\nPlenty of the details are still up in the air, but the report notes that the ByteDance / Pico goggles should be very similar to Meta's next mixed reality device. Following the release of the Quest 3S, Meta reportedly postponed work on the Quest 4 in favor of developing lightweight mixed reality goggles, according to UploadVR. The company has been publicly pushing AI wearables like the newly introduced Oakley Meta HSTN glasses, and it seems like its next Quest device will be closer to smart glasses than a VR headset with controllers.\nIt's not known when ByteDance's  goggles will actually be released or where they'll be sold.
