While FAR requires “full and open competition,” the pathway’s high compliance standards implicitly keep newcomers out. Instead, Greenwalt said the program should be done as an Other Transaction Authority (OTA), which gives the DOD more flexibility to work with non-traditional vendors and fund prototypes with follow-on production opportunities. “A CICA IDIQ contract is about the dumbest way to do this if you want innovation as it will preclude non-traditionals from bidding.

    "full_text": "Previously, she was a writer and editor at MUO. Google Workspace is launching a new security measure to help prevent the same type of account takeover attack that impacted Linus Tech Tips. The feature, which is rolling out in beta for Chrome users on Windows, is designed to block bad actors from remotely stealing the cookies that keep you logged into your Workspace account. Google calls the feature Device Bound Session Credentials (DBSC), and it does exactly what its name suggests: it protects users’ Workspace accounts by binding session cookies, the temporary files that websites use to remember user information, to their devices. That makes it more difficult for attackers to carry out session token-stealing attacks, which often occur when a victim downloads information-stealing malware. From there, bad actors can exfiltrate a victim’s login credentials to a remote server, allowing them to sign into their account from another device or sell their credentials. “Because this theft occurs after a user has logged in, it bypasses many existing account protections like 2FA [two-factor authentication],” Google spokesperson Ross Richendrfer tells The Verge. “Existing protections for this type of attack aren’t very mature, so it’s low-hanging fruit for attackers.” Google says there’s been an “exponential rise” in cookie and authentication token theft over the past couple of years, and that this “trend has only intensified in 2025.” The company began working on DBSC last year, and said the verification platform Okta, as well as browsers like Microsoft Edge, have “expressed interest” in the concept. Along with DBSC, Google recommends that Workspace administrators enable passkeys as well, which is now available to over 11 million customers."

Last night, Nintendo quietly added Mario Paint to the Nintendo Switch Online’s catalog of Super Nintendo games. Originally released back in 1992, Mario Paint was a unique SNES title, because although it included a handful of mini games, it was first and foremost a creative tool letting players draw, paint, animate, and even compose music using the 16-bit console. What also set Mario Paint apart from other SNES games was that it didn’t rely on the console’s standard gamepad. It came bundled with a two-button mouse and a plastic mouse pad that made drawing and navigating the game’s on-screen menus and drag-and-drop interface much easier. In 1992, creative apps like Photoshop were still in their relative infancy —- Photoshop didn’t even have its useful layers feature yet — and for many kids, Mario Paint was their first exposure to using a digital creative tool (and perhaps even a mouse). Alongside Mario Paint being added to the Switch’s SNES catalog, Nintendo has enabled mouse support for the Switch’s SNES app, which is compatible with games like Mario’s Super Picross and Nobunaga’s Ambition. On the original Switch, players can connect a compatible USB mouse to play Mario Paint, while on the Switch 2 the Joy-Con 2 controller’s mouse functionality can be used. The company also recently added 19 tracks from Mario Paint to the Nintendo Music mobile app, including the three sample compositions available in the game’s music sequencer."

While the Facecam 4K is $100 less than the Facecam Pro, it also has support for optional lens filters — a first for a webcam. The Facecam 4K will support any 49mm lens filter, allowing owners to apply cinematic effects like diffusion or reduce reflections from glasses with circular polarizing (CPL) filters. Elgato’s Facecam 4K uses Sony’s Starvis 2 CMOS sensor with a f/4.0 aperture, fixed focus, and Elgato prime lens. That means the Facecam Pro’s f/2.0 aperture will still be better for low-light situations. Much like the Facecam Pro, you can record at up to 4K with 60fps or up to 4K with 30fps and HDR enabled. The Facecam 4K will connect over USB-C, has a 1/4-inch thread for mounting, and weighs 0.25 lbs (112 grams) without the monitor mount and cable. You can also save all of these settings directly to the camera’s built-in memory, so you don’t have to keep Camera Hub running. The Facecam 4K will also work with Elgato’s Prompter hardware, thanks to a replacement backplate that will be available to purchase from Elgato’s web store. Elgato’s Facecam 4K is also compatible with the Nintendo Switch 2, as long as you update the webcam’s firmware to version 2.32 or later."

When a pool is created, the organizer can request contributions with in-app “$Cashtag” invitations, or via texts and shareable links for group members who use Apple Pay and Google Pay. “We know that many of our customers already use the platform as a way to collect payments from groups,” Cash App product design head Cameron Worboys said in the press release. “With pools, our customers now have a dedicated, easy-to-use solution for group payments: they can start a pool to collect the money in seconds, and then instantly transfer the funds to their Cash App balance when it’s time to pay.” Cash App says it’s launching the pools feature today for a “select group” of customers, and that the feature will roll out broadly “in the coming months.” Cash App pools can be created through the app’s payments tab, and can be closed at any time to transfer the money to the organizer’s Cash App balance. Pool organizers can set a funding target to help keep track of how much needs to be paid, and who has contributed towards group purchases, such as meals, vacation bookings, or event tickets. It’s similar to the money-pooling capabilities that PayPal launched in November last year, though PayPal’s offering notably allows users to make pool contributions directly from their bank accounts. Settle Up and Venmo have also created features that aim to make tracking and pooling group expenses more convenient."

An update rolling out today introduces AI image upscaling, improved object removal, and an automatic composition tool that can seamlessly blend new elements into images in just a few clicks. When you add a new object to a photograph, Harmonize will automatically adjust the color, lighting, shadows, and visual tone of the added element to naturally blend it into the main image — something that typically requires a decent amount of skill and experience with photo editing software. It’s launching in beta for Photoshop users on both web and desktop, and is available in early access on the Photoshop iOS mobile app. A generative AI-powered image upscaling tool is also launching in beta for Photoshop on web and desktop. The automatic object removal tool for desktop and web Photoshop users is also being updated to “clean up your images with more precision,” according to Adobe. Photoshop will apply digital Content Credentials to edited images that contain information about how they were manipulated, which is good for accountability, but not prevention. I can imagine far more wholesome ways to use these tools than I can nefarious ones, but it’s now even easier to do the latter than it was before. Content Credentials give the option for good actors to attach edit history to their work and create a digital chain of trust and authenticity.” Last year, I said that likening concerns about generative AI photo editing apps to Photoshop was a poor comparison."

A two-pack containing a router and a single satellite is available for $249.99 for those in smaller households, and additional Orbi 370 satellites can be purchased for $149.99 to expand mesh network coverage. Netgear says the Orbi 370 is compatible with any service provider and supports Wi-Fi speeds of up to 5Gbps. Both the router and satellites include integrated 2.5Gbps Ethernet ports, allowing wired connections to be used with more demanding devices like gaming systems and smart TVs. The Orbi 370 supports 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands, which can be combined using Multi-Link Operation (MLO) to potentially provide faster downloads, less latency, and a more stable connection to Wi-Fi 7 devices. The more affordable entry point is targeting growing households, or those with “moderately demanding Wi-Fi needs,” according to Netgear, but will also likely appeal to anyone who was looking for an excuse to upgrade from older wireless network standards. You still need Wi-Fi 7-compatible devices — which are fairly uncommon — to actually use Wi-Fi 7 features, but the Orbi 370 is backwards compatible with Wi-Fi 4/5/6/6E. The added stability that the MLO feature can provide to wireless connections may carry over to devices that use older Wi-Fi standards too, providing something that users can benefit from immediately if they’re futureproofing with the mesh router system."

BobDaHacker said a second vulnerability allowed them to take over any Lovense user’s account using just their email address, which could be derived from the earlier bug. This bug lets anyone create authentication tokens for accessing a Lovense account without needing a password, allowing an attacker to remotely control the account as if they were the real user. “Cam models use these tools for work, so this was a huge deal. Literally anyone could take over any account just by knowing the email address,” said BobDaHacker. According to BobDaHacker, they were awarded a total of $3,000 via bug bounty site HackerOne. The company told BobDaHacker in the same email that it decided against a “faster, one-month fix,” which would have required forcing customers using older products to upgrade their apps immediately.

    "summary": "If you're at all familiar with Meta's Ray-Ban-branded smart glasses, there won't be many surprises when it comes to its latest Oakley frames. The Oakley Meta glasses rely heavily on what's already been a successful playbook for the company: the style of a popular eyewear brand mixed with juuust enough tech to let you keep your phone in your pocket a little longer.\nBut the Oakley Meta glasses are also the social media company's first collaboration with a non-Ray-Ban brand (though both share a parent company in EssilorLuxottica). And while Meta stays pretty close to the strategy it's used for the last four years, its latest frames offer some hints about its longterm ambitions in the space. \nMeta has described its Oakley-branded frames as \"performance glasses,\" which isn't entirely surprising given Oakley's longtime association with athletes. But there are only a few actual upgrades compared to the Ray-Ban lineup. The Oakley Meta glasses have a notably longer battery life, both for the glasses themselves and the charging case. They are also able to capture higher quality video than previous versions.\nWith a starting price of nearly $400, though, I'm not sure those upgrades are worth an extra $100 - $200.\n \nWhy do they look like that?\nMeta's debut pair of Oakley-branded glasses are based on the brand's HSTN (pronounced how-stuhn) frames and there's really nothing subtle about the design. The first of these is a limited edition version with shiny gold lenses and bright white frames (which Meta inexplicably calls \"warm grey\").\nLike previous Ray-Ban models, they don't look overtly techy, but I still wasn't a big fan of the design. The glasses felt just a little oversized for my face and something about the bright white paired with gold lenses reminded me a little too much of a bug. The color combo also accentuates just how thick the frames are, particularly around the awkwardly wide nosepiece.\n\n\n\n\n   Karissa Bell for Engadget \n \n\nI posted a selfie on my Instagram Story and polled my friends on what they thought. And while a few politely said they thought I was \"pulling them off,\" the majority said they looked too big for my face. A few told me they looked straight-up weird, and one summed up my feelings pretty well with \"something looks off about them.\" Style is subjective, of course. And depending on your face shape and tolerance for contrasting colors, I could see others enjoying the design. I'm looking forward to seeing the rest of the HSTN collection, which is coming later this summer, and will hopefully have some more flattering color variations.\nLooks aside, the glasses function almost identically to the Ray-Ban glasses Meta introduced in 2023. There's a 12-megapixel POV camera over the left eye, and an indicator light over the right that lights up when you snap a photo or start recording a video via the capture button. There are open-ear speakers in the arms so you can listen to music and hear notifications. Much like the Ray-Ban glasses, the speakers here are pretty good at containing the sound so others can't hear when you're listening at lower volumes, but it's definitely noticeable at higher levels. You can control music playback and volume pretty easily, though, with a touchpad on the right side of the glasses.\n\"Performance\" upgrades\nThe most important upgrade that comes with the Oakley glasses is the battery. Meta claims the glasses can last up to eight hours with \"typical\" (non-constant) use and up to 19 on standby. I was able to squeeze a little over five hours of continuous music playback out of the battery in one sitting, which is about an hour better than the Ray-Ban frames. The charging case can provide up to 48 hours of additional runtime, according to Meta. It's been well over a week and I haven't yet had to plug in the case.\nThe charging case is, however, noticeably bigger and heavier than the Ray-Ban case. It's not a dealbreaker, but the case is too big for any of my pockets and just barely fits into my small sling bag. My other gripe with the charging case is the same complaint I had about the Ray-Ban case: there's no way to see the charge level of the case itself. There's a small LED in the front that will change from green to yellow to red based on the battery level, but it's hardly a precise indicator.\n\n\n\n\n   Karissa Bell for Engadget \n \n\nThe other major upgrade is the 12MP camera, which can now shoot in 3K compared to 1080p on previous models. The higher resolution video is, notably, not the default setting, but I appreciated having the option. I could see it being especially useful for creators looking to shoot POV footage, but I mostly use the glasses for still shots rather than video.\nSan Francisco is currently having a record-breaking cold summer so most of my testing has been in fairly overcast conditions. It might be a product of the gray weather, but I found the photos I've shot with the glasses a bit overly saturated for my taste. They looked fine on an Instagram Story, though. The camera has a bit of a wide angle with a 100-degree field of view, so there's still a bit of a learning curve in terms of figuring out how best to frame the shots. \nAnother issue is that it's very easy for a hat or a piece of hair to make it into your photos without realizing. My previous experience with the Ray-Ban Meta glasses meant I was careful to pull my hair back before snapping a picture, but I was bummed to realize after a long bike ride that the visor on my helmet was visible in the frame of every photo and video. It seems like Meta may have a plan to address this: I noticed a setting called \"media quality\" that's meant to alert you when something is partially obstructing the camera. The feature is apparently still testing, though, and it wasn't functional. A Meta spokesperson did confirm it would be added in a future update, though. \"Media Quality Check is a feature we're working to bring to our AI glasses collection in the future that will alert users when photos are blurry or if something like your hair or a hat blocks what you capture,\" Meta said.\nThe Meta AI app (formerly known as Meta View) can help fix other issues, though. It has a \"smart crop\" feature that can automatically straighten your pics to correct for any head tilt. It also has built in AI-powered edits for photos and video so you can restyle your clips directly in the app. And while the functionality isn't limited to clips shot with the glasses, the possibility of adding AI edits after the fact makes shooting otherwise mundane clips a bit more appealing. The ability to restyle video, however, is only \"free for a limited time,\" according to the Meta AI app. \nMeta AI\nWhile the core features of Meta's smart glasses have largely stayed the same since it first introduced the Ray-Ban Stories in 2021, one of the more interesting changes is how Mark Zuckerberg and other execs have shifted from calling them \"smart glasses\" to \"AI glasses.\" As the company has shifted away from the metaverse and made AI a central focus, it's not surprising those themes would play out in its wearables too.\nAnd while none of the Meta AI features are unique to the Oakley frames, Meta has added a couple of abilities since my last review that are worth mentioning. The first is live translation. The feature, which you have to enable in the Meta AI app, allows the onboard assistant to translate speech as you hear it. If both sides of a conversation have a pair of Meta glasses, then you can carry on a full conversation even if you don't speak the same language. The feature currently supports Spanish, French, Italian and English.\n\n\n\n\n   Karissa Bell for Engadget \n \n\nI tried it out with my husband — a native Spanish speaker who was also wearing a pair of Meta glasses — and we were both fairly impressed. I would say something in English and Meta AI on his glasses would relay it to him in Spanish. He would then respond in Spanish and Meta AI would translate the words into English.\nIt's not the most natural way to speak because you have to pause and wait for a translation, but it was mostly effective. There were a few bugs, though. Because we were sitting close to each other, sometimes Meta AI would overhear the translated audio from the other person's glasses and translate it back, which made the whole thing feel like a bizarre game of telephone.\nAnd over the course of a several-minute conversation, there were a handful of times when Meta AI wouldn't pick up on what was said at all, or would only begin translating halfway through a statement. We also encountered some issues with Meta AI's translations when it came to slang or regional variations of certain words. While it wasn't perfect, I could see it being useful while traveling since it's much smoother than using Google Translate. There was also something endlessly amusing about hearing my husband's words relayed back to me by the voice of AI Judi Dench (Meta tapped a bunch of celebrities last year to help voice its AI).\n\n\n\n   Stills from a video of a walk through a parking lot (left), and the same image after using the \"desert rave\" effect in Meta AI app. \n \n\n   Screenshots (Meta AI) \n \n\nThe other major AI addition is something called \"Live AI,\" which is essentially a real-time version of the glasses' multimodal powers. Once you start a Live AI session, Meta's assistant is able to \"see\" everything you're looking at and you can ask it questions without having to repeatedly say \"hey Meta.\" For example, you can look at plants and ask it to identify them, or ask about landmarks or your surroundings.\nThe feature can feel a bit gimmicky and it doesn't always work the way you want it to. For example, Meta AI can identify landmarks but it can't help you find them. While on a bike ride, I asked if it could help me navigate somewhere based on the intersection I was at and Meta AI responded that it was unable to help with navigation. It also didn't correctly identify some (admittedly exotic) plants during a walk through San Francisco's botanical gardens. But it did helpfully let me know that I may want to keep my distance from a pack of geese on the path.\nI'm still not entirely sure what problems these types of multimodal features are meant to solve, but I think it offers an interesting window into how Meta is positioning its smart glasses as an AI-first product. It also opens up some intriguing possibilities whenever we get a version of Meta glasses with an actual display, which the rumor mill suggests could come as soon as this year.\nWrap-up\nWhile I don't love the style of the Oakley Meta HSTN frames, Meta has shown that it's been consistently able to improve its glasses. The upgrades that come with the new Oakley frames aren't major leaps, but they deliver improvements to core features. Whether those upgrades justify the price, though, depends a lot on how you plan to use the glasses.\nThe special edition HSTN frames I tested are $499 and the other versions coming later this year will start at $399. Considering you can get several models of Meta's Ray-Ban glasses for just $299, I'm not sure the upgrades justify the added cost for most people. That's probably why Meta has positioned these as a \"performance\" model better suited to athletes and Oakley loyalists.\nBut the glasses do offer a clearer picture of where Meta is going with its smart glasses. We know the company is planning to add displays and, eventually, full augmented reality capabilities — both of which will benefit from better battery life and cameras. Both are also likely to cost a whole lot more than any of the frames we've seen so far. But, if you don't want to wait, the Oakley Meta glasses are the closest you can get to that right now.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wearables/oakley-meta-glasses-review-a-familiar-formula-with-some-upgrades-120026844.html?src=rss",

Meta has described its Oakley-branded frames as \"performance glasses,\" which isn't entirely surprising given Oakley's longtime association with athletes. Oakley/Meta 79 100 Expert Score Oakley Meta glasses There are some solid upgrades that will appeal to serious athletes and power users, but they don't quite justify the higher price. The first of these is a limited edition version with shiny gold lenses and bright white frames (which Meta inexplicably calls \"warm grey\"). A few told me they looked straight-up weird, and one summed up my feelings pretty well with \"something looks off about them.\" San Francisco is currently having a record-breaking cold summer so most of my testing has been in fairly overcast conditions. We also encountered some issues with Meta AI's translations when it came to slang or regional variations of certain words.

But the iPhones have always focused first and foremost on delivering some of the best image quality you can get in a camera phone, and as a professional photographer I want to see that same dedication to taking better photos. The Xiaomi 14 Ultra's camera blew me away with its variable aperture that created stunning starbursts in night time images. Apple has invested in core image quality technologies, not simply used AI to make up for any hardware shortcomings. Apple has been a pioneer in applying machine learning to overcome limitations of tiny smartphone cameras, such as its Deep Fusion imaging technology that captures multiple exposures and blends them into a final, evenly-exposed image. But these are arguably tools to enhance an existing image, and I'm worried that the next iPhone's camera will be all about how you can generate entirely new scenes without even having to step outside your house. The huge rise in popularity of compact cameras shows that people still care about taking real photos. Actual sunset colors casting across golden sandy beaches, not an AI's generic interpretation of what a beach looks like. AI has its place and I'm braced for Apple's September event to be AI-focused. As AI seeps deeper into our phone experience and Apple pushes on with its AI strategy, I'm concerned that the company could make rash decisions with its imaging experience in order to try and justify the existence of Apple Intelligence."

Because bits and bytes are so small -- just a single letter or number -- they’re not really useful when we’re talking about bigger files like images or videos. A lot of the confusion around megabits and megabytes happens when they’re abbreviated. Internet speeds are always referred to as Mbps or megabits per second. Since we know that 8 bits make up one byte, we can extend that knowledge further to make a simple formula for converting between megabytes and megabits: For example, if you're trying to download a 100MB file over a 100Mbps internet connection (or 12.5MB), you'll divide the file size by the bandwidth in megabytes to get 8 seconds. Naturally, there are a lot of factors that influence how fast or slow your internet is. This conversation formula is a helpful tool, but it most likely won't be an exact measure of your internet speeds. Megabits per second (Mbps) are always used when referring to Wi-Fi speeds."

Best of all, most air fryer recipes take less time than it takes to preheat your oven -- or sweat through another tongs-in-hand grill session. Trendy air fryers are all they're cracked up to be, especially when it's hot out. To find real-world differences, I roasted chicken thighs in my KitchenAid wall oven (less than 10 years old) and a 4-quart Dreo air fryer, according to two popular recipes from a well-known cooking site. I tested the temperature before, during and after to see how much of a difference each machine makes. An ambient thermometer is all I needed to test how much hotter a gas oven can make the kitchen. Spread that out over time or for longer cooking sessions and using the oven during hot months can have real fiscal ramifications.

How much energy does an air fryer save when compared to a wall oven?"

Many variables exist (including the internet connection type), so when you sign up for internet service, you shouldn't assume AT&T will always be your fastest option. That said, Ookla's report shows AT&T Fiber at the top of its charts, registering a median download speed of just over 363 megabits per second in tests collected by Ookla from January through June 2025. Ookla is an internet speed-test company that collects data via its Speedtest.net tool, which gathers insights from millions of daily customer uses. For example, it can help you pinpoint when and where your connection may be laggy. Many things can affect a speed test, including whether or not you're using Wi-Fi or a hardwired Ethernet connection, the time of day you're running the test and so on. It was the fastest provider in nine of the country's top 100 cities (second only to AT&T Fiber), but it didn't reach enough households to meet Ookla's mark for national inclusion. Yes, nabbing the top spot is certainly something a company like AT&T can brag about."

While Residential still offers unlimited data, its download speeds are slower -- about 45 to 130 megabits per second. That speed might be enough for everyday browsing and streaming, but it won't match the performance of Starlink's standard plan. Still, if you're in one of the eligible states and need reliable rural internet access without paying top-tier prices, this lighter plan could be exactly what you've been waiting for. The Residential Lite plan at $80 a month is now available in 30 states. Thus, Residential Lite subscribers may experience slow internet speeds if enough people are online. The Affordable Connectivity Program ended last year, due to funds running out. At $80 per month, the Residential Lite plan from Starlink is quite affordable for satellite internet service, but it's still not quite as good a deal as faster broadband plans from major ISP providers. AT&T Fiber's 300Mbps plan is $55 monthly, and Xfinity is even cheaper with a 400Mbps plan at a starting price of $40.

    "summary": "You might already have a good idea of which smartphone you want to be your next one. But there are more solid options available now than ever before, making the decision not as cut-and-dry as it used to be. While the decision is a bit easier if you know you want an iPhone, there's even enough variation between those new models that you may have to think about it longer than you anticipated. If you’re an Android person, you have even more options to choose from — including foldables — and more questions to answer before you spend any money.At Engadget, we review phones regularly and have tested dozens over the years. Whether you’ve had your eye on one of our current top picks, one of Samsung's Galaxy S25 phones, a cheap phone or another device, we’re here to help you decide which is the best phone to buy this year.\nAndroid or iOS?\nWhen you're searching for the best smartphone, it becomes clear that each OS has its pros and cons. Apple’s tight-knit ecosystem makes it super easy to share data between iPhones, iPads and Macs or seamlessly hand-off phone calls or music from one device to another. At the same time, you’re effectively locked in, as services like Apple Messages aren’t available on other platforms. \nAs for Android, there’s a much wider range of handsets from companies like Google, Samsung, Sony and more. However, Android phones don’t enjoy that same length of software support and often have lower trade-in values. In short, there’s no wrong answer. However, you will want to consider how your phone will fit in with the rest of your devices. So unless you’re really fed up with one OS and willing to learn another, it probably doesn’t make a lot of sense to switch from an iPhone to an Android phone (or vice versa) – especially if everyone else in your household is using the same platform.\nCameras\nSince your cell phone often pulls double duty as your primary camera, figuring out what kind of photo tools you want is key. Nowadays, practically every mobile phone can take a great picture in bright light. But if you want a long optical zoom, you’ll probably have to upgrade to a more expensive device.\n\n\n\n\n   Cherlynn Low / Engadget \n \n\nMid-range phones often only have two rear cameras (a primary wide-angle lens and a secondary ultra-wide camera) and can sometimes struggle in low-light situations. Each phone maker also has various features that might be a better fit for your style, with Apple offering four different color presets on the latest iPhones, while Google’s Pixel 9 Pro comes with neat tools like dedicated long exposure and Action Pan modes.\nWill you get mmWave 5G or Wi-Fi 7?\nThe good news is that in 2025, most phones have at least Wi-Fi 6 or Wi-Fi 6e and support for some kind of 5G connectivity. However, if you want the fastest wireless speeds possible, it’s going to cost you a little extra. For example, on certain networks, mmWave 5G offers up to gigabit download speeds, less latency and better bandwidth. But mmWave 5G also requires more sophisticated (and pricier) modems, which means support for it is often missing on less expensive devices.\nOn the bright side, mmWave 5G isn’t as widely available as other versions of 5G, so depending on where you live and what network you’re on, you may not be missing out on much right now if you buy a phone that doesn’t support it. It’s a similar situation for Wi-Fi 7, which is available on some high-end handsets like the Galaxy S25, but harder to find on cheaper devices. Wi-Fi 7 also requires you to have a compatible router, so unless you know you need it or have a specific use case in mind, the lack of support for mmWave 5G or Wi-Fi 7 shouldn’t be a dealbreaker when looking for a new phone.\nOther features to consider\nBecause not everyone agrees on what makes the best phone, you should think about any other specs that might be extra important for you. Mobile gamers will almost certainly appreciate the 120Hz refresh rates you get on phones like the Samsung Galaxy S25 or the Apple iPhone 16 Pro. Alternatively, if long battery life is important, you’ll probably want to go with a larger iPhone or an Android phone with a battery that’s between 4,000 and 5,000 mAh in size. Meanwhile, if you find yourself juggling a lot of devices, it can be really nice to have a phone that supports reverse wireless charging, which on Samsung phones even lets you recharge the company’s Galaxy Watches.\n \n \n \n \n \n \nOther smartphones we've tested\nSamsung Galaxy S25 Ultra\nLike its predecessor, the S25 Ultra is an incredibly versatile phone. It’s one of the few handsets that come with an included stylus and premium features like a gorgeous 6.9-inch AMOLED display, titanium frame and a 5x telephoto camera. It also has excellent performance and strong battery life. The issue is that, aside from improved AI, this year’s phone doesn’t offer that much more than the previous model (or the one before that), and with prices starting at $1,300, we feel it needs to do more to earn a top pick spot.\nOnePlus 13\nWhile the OnePlus 13 features some basic AI features like Google’s Circle to Search and Gemini assistant, it’s really just an old-fashioned flagship in all the best ways. That’s because instead of focusing on machine learning, OnePlus crammed the phone with tons of top-notch hardware. It sports a 6.8-inch OLED display with an incredible peak brightness of up to 4,500 nits. The OP13 also offers excellent performance thanks to Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 8 Elite chip, along with 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage. There are also three 50-MP rear cameras including one with a 3x telephoto zoom and a massive 6,000 mAh battery that’s bigger than what you get in practically all of its competitors.\nOnePlus didn’t skimp on the phone’s design either, as the OP13 still comes with the company’s signature Alert Slider. Plus, if you opt for the blue or white variants, you’ll get a durable and very touchable vegan leather back that helps the phone stand out among all its glass brick rivals. But the best part is that starting at $900, it costs less than an equivalent Galaxy S25+ too.\nFAQs\nHow do I know which smartphone is the best for me?\nWhile choosing the best smartphone can be challenging, it mostly comes down to how you plan on using the device. All of the best phones available now get the basics right — you’ll be able to make calls, text and access the internet without many hiccups. If your smartphone is your most used gadget, you may want to consider paying for a device on the higher end of the price spectrum. That will get you better overall performance, higher-quality cameras and a phone that will last for many years. If you don’t use your phone for everything, you may be able to compromise on performance and extra perks and spend less on a still-capable handset.\nHow much is a smartphone?\nSmartphones range in price from $300 to over $1,500. The best budget phones available now will usually compromise on overall performance, design, camera prowess and extra features to keep costs down. On the flip side, the most expensive phones will have powerful processors, triple-camera arrays and even flip or fold designs. Most people will find a phone that fits their needs somewhere in the middle of that wide price range — we’ve found that most of the best smartphones available right now cost between $500 and $1,000.\nWhat can you do on a smartphone?\nSmartphones are essentially small, portable computers that let you do things like check email, browse social media, follow map directions, make contactless payments and more. This is all on top of the basics like making phone calls and texting, which we’ve come to expect in all modern cell phones. Smartphones have also mostly replaced compact cameras thanks to their high-quality, built-in shooters, and the fact that most smartphones today as just as portable, if not more so, as compact cameras.\nHow long do smartphones last?\nSmartphones can last years and people are holding on to their phones longer now than ever before. Software updates and battery life are two of the biggest factors that can affect phone longevity. Apple promises five years worth of software updates for its latest iPhones, and Google promises the same for its Pixel phones. Samsung phones will get four years worth of Android updates from the time they launch. As for charging speeds and battery life, your phone can deteriorate over time as you use and recharge your phone on a regular basis.\nRecent updates\nJuly 2025: Updated to include the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7.\nApril 2025: Updated to include the Google Pixel 9a.\nFebruary 2025: Updated to include the iPhone 16e.\nJanuary 2025: Updated to include details about Samsung's latest Galaxy S-series phones.\nSeptember 2024: Updated to include the latest iPhone 16 models and a new midrange iPhone top pick.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/best-smartphones-140004900.html?src=rss",

But mmWave 5G also requires more sophisticated (and pricier) modems, which means support for it is often missing on less expensive devices. As we discovered in our testing for the iPhone 16 Pro review, it’ll take a bit of getting used to at first. The Pixel 9 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro both start at $999, and though some of us have come to think of Google's handsets as the more competitively priced option, this year's model might be good enough to justify a premium price. So while it's not super fancy, the phone has all of its most important bases covered (and then some). Sadly there’s still no dedicated telephoto lens, which makes it less useful in some shooting situations. But the best part is that starting at $900, it costs less than an equivalent Galaxy S25+ too. Smartphones can last years and people are holding on to their phones longer now than ever before."

It'll likely arrive with the just-announced iOS 26, which features Apple's biggest software design shakeup in over a decade. You can check out our iPhone 17 rumor roundup for more on what might be coming in the fall. If you buy a new iPhone 16 now, you'll probably pay full price for something that in just a couple months' time will technically be outdated (the harsh reality of the annual phone release cycle). While smartphones and computers were given an exemption from President Donald Trump's more extensive tariffs, he recently said Apple will still have to pay a 25% tariff on iPhones made outside the US. \"The iPhone hasn't had a price hike in five years and is due for one,\" he writes. If you were already planning on purchasing a new iPhone and can't wait much longer, I can understand panic-buying now. And again, even if you don't want the latest and greatest iPhone, you can at least snag an older version at a discount right after the iPhone 17 drops. In general, we recommend upgrading to a new phone if your existing one is more than two generations old. You can typically wring more life out of your device, but if you want to stay on top of the latest features like Apple Intelligence, leveling up is the way to go."

The terms were clear, and I didn't see any red flags or hidden \"gotchas.\" I've used a lot of different eSIMs, but GigSky was by far the easiest to set up. Since Cat Ba is a bit more remote, I was worried about my mobile signal there. I paid special attention when my complimentary plan expired, just in case this was one of those \"free trial turning into auto-renewing subscription unless you cancel\" situations. If your habits are similar to mine, the complimentary 1GB data plan should be enough for short vacations. I would definitely recommend the complimentary plan to any eligible Visa cardholders heading abroad for a short vacation, but if your data needs or travel timeline call for buying a paid plan beyond the trial, I'd recommend comparing costs among multiple providers before committing to any one."

    "summary": "Managing your finances doesn’t have to be complicated, and there are so many tools available now that can make things easier (and even partially automated) for you. I was a Mint user for many years, but I was forced to find a new budgeting app after the service shut down in March 2024. Mint’s parent company, Intuit, prompted folks to try their other financial app, Credit Karma. However, after testing Credit Karma myself, I found it to be a poor Mint replacement. So I set out to try all of the best budgeting apps available today to find a new home for all of my financial tracking and goal-setting. Hopefully my journey can help you find the best budgeting app for you and your money as well.\nBest budget apps of 2025\n \n \n \n \n \nOther budgeting apps we tested\nPocketGuard\nPocketGuard used to be a solid free budget tracker, but the company has since limited its “free” version to just a free seven-day trial. Now, you’ll have to choose between two plans once the trial is over: a $13 monthly plan or a $75 annual plan. When I first tested it, I found it to be more restricted than NerdWallet, but still a decent option. The main overview screen shows you your net worth, total assets and debts; net income and total spending for the month; upcoming bills; a handy reminder of when your next paycheck lands; any debt payoff plan you have; and any goals. Like some other apps, including Quicken Simplifi, PocketGuard promotes an “after bills” approach, where you enter all of your recurring bills, and then PocketGuard shows you what’s left, and that’s what you’re supposed to be budgeting: your disposable income. \nAlthough PocketGuard’s UI is easy enough to understand, it lacks polish. The “accounts” tab is a little busy, and doesn’t show totals for categories like cash or investments. Seemingly small details like weirdly phrased or punctuated copy occasionally make the app feel janky. More than once, it prompted me to update the app when no updates were available. The web version, meanwhile, feels like the mobile app blown up to a larger format and doesn’t take advantage of the extra screen real estate. Ultimately, now that the free tier is gone, it just doesn’t present the same value proposition as it once did.\nHow we test budgeting apps\nBefore I dove in and started testing out budgeting apps, I had to do some research. To find a list of apps to try out, I consulted trusty ol’ Google (and even trustier Reddit); read reviews of popular apps on the App Store; and also asked friends and colleagues what budget tracking apps (or other budgeting methods) they might be using for money management. Some of the apps I found were free and these, of course, show loads of ads (excuse me, “offers”) to stay in business. But most of the available apps require paid subscriptions, with prices typically topping out around $100 a year, or $15 a month. (Spoiler: My top pick is cheaper than that.)\nAll of the services I chose to test needed to do several things: import all of your account data into one place; offer budgeting tools; and track your spending, net worth and credit score. Except where noted, all of these apps are available for iOS, Android and on the web.\nOnce I had my shortlist of six apps, I got to work setting them up. For the sake of thoroughly testing these apps, I made a point of adding every account to every budgeting app, no matter how small or immaterial the balance. What ensued was a veritable Groundhog Day of two-factor authentication. Just hours of entering passwords and one-time passcodes, for the same banks half a dozen times over. Hopefully, you only have to do this once.\nBudgeting app FAQs\nWhat is Plaid and how does it work?\nEach of the apps I tested uses the same underlying network, called Plaid, to pull in financial data, so it’s worth explaining what it is and how it works. Plaid was founded as a fintech startup in 2013 and is today the industry standard in connecting banks with third-party apps. Plaid works with over 12,000 financial institutions across the US, Canada and Europe. Additionally, more than 8,000 third-party apps and services rely on Plaid, the company claims.\nTo be clear, you don’t need a dedicated Plaid app to use it; the technology is baked into a wide array of apps, including all of the budgeting apps listed in this guide. Once you find the “add an account” option in whichever one you’re using, you’ll see a menu of commonly used banks. There’s also a search field you can use to look yours up directly. Once you find yours, you’ll be prompted to enter your login credentials. If you have two-factor authentication set up, you’ll need to enter a one-time passcode as well.\nAs the middleman, Plaid is a passthrough for information that may include your account balances, transaction history, account type and routing or account number. Plaid uses encryption, and says it has a policy of not selling or renting customer data to other companies. However, I would not be doing my job if I didn’t note that in 2022 Plaid was forced to pay $58 million to consumers in a class action suit for collecting “more financial data than was needed.” As part of the settlement, Plaid was compelled to change some of its business practices.\nIn a statement provided to Engadget, a Plaid spokesperson said the company continues to deny the allegations underpinning the lawsuit and that “the crux of the non-financial terms in the settlement are focused on us accelerating workstreams already underway related to giving people more transparency into Plaid’s role in connecting their accounts, and ensuring that our workstreams around data minimization remain on track.”\nWhy did Mint shut down?\nWhen parent company Intuit announced in December 2023 that it would shut down Mint, it did not provide a reason why it made the decision to do so. It did say that Mint's millions of users would be funneled over to its other finance app, Credit Karma. \"Credit Karma is thrilled to invite all Minters to continue their financial journey on Credit Karma, where they will have access to Credit Karma’s suite of features, products, tools and services, including some of Mint’s most popular features,\" Mint wrote on its product blog. In our testing, we found that Credit Karma isn't an exact replacement for Mint — so if you're still looking for a Mint alternative, you have some decent options.\nWhat about Rocket Money?\nRocket Money is another free financial app that tracks spending and supports things like balance alerts and account linking. If you pay for the premium tier, the service can also help you cancel unwanted subscriptions. We did not test it for this guide, but we'll consider it in future updates.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/apps/best-budgeting-apps-120036303.html?src=rss",
    "full_text": "I was particularly impressed at how easily it connected to Fidelity; not all budget trackers do, for whatever reason. Monarch has also made it easier to connect through those other two networks, if for some reason Plaid fails. Instead of manually uploading statements, the new functionality allows apps like Monarch's to automatically pull in transactions and balance history. But until it follows through, I can’t recommend Copilot for most people with so many good competitors out there. In particular, Copilot does a better job than almost any other app of visualizing your recurring monthly expenses. It’s a good way to both weed out fraudulent charges, and also be somewhat intentional about your spending habits. The “accounts” tab is a little busy, and doesn’t show totals for categories like cash or investments. Just hours of entering passwords and one-time passcodes, for the same banks half a dozen times over. Plaid uses encryption, and says it has a policy of not selling or renting customer data to other companies.

    "summary": "The United Kingdom's Online Safety Act took effect on July 25th. Among other provisions, the new law makes websites responsible for protecting UK children from content deemed harmful, like pornography or the promotion of eating disorders. This has resulted in many of the most-used websites, including Pornhub, X and Reddit, either putting up or planning to put up age verification barriers to restrict access by minors.\nAge-restricting laws put broadly popular websites in a difficult position. Sites like Reddit that rely on user-generated content have no good way of making sure nobody under 18 ever sees restricted material anywhere on the platform, so it's usually simpler to just ban minors altogether. But this creates a knock-on problem: underage users relying on unvetted free virtual private networks (VPNs) to get back on their favorite platforms.\nUK residents are using VPNs to change their apparent locations to other countries and circumvent the Online Safety Act. In the few days since the law went into force, five of the 10 most-downloaded free apps in the UK have been VPNs. We like two of the five, Proton VPN and NordVPN, but NordVPN does not have a free plan — just a seven-day free trial, after which you have to pay. The other three are unvetted, untested and suspiciously generic (VPN Super Unlimited Proxy, FreeVPN.org and Unlimited VPN Proxy).\nWhen you use a VPN, all your web traffic goes through one of the VPN's servers before moving on to its ultimate destination. Every time you connect, you're trusting the VPN not to abuse its access to your information, and some VPNs unfortunately abuse that trust. A free VPN is generally safe if it's supported by paid subscriptions, like Proton is. If there is no paid tier, or the free tier comes with no restrictions, you have to ask yourself where the money is coming from. \nThe saying that \"if the product is free, then the real product is you\" holds true here. For example, Hola VPN admits in its terms of service that its sister company Bright Data can sell free users' residential IPs as proxy servers, and Hotspot Shield was the subject of an FTC complaint in 2017 that charged it with providing personally identifiable information to advertisers. And one of the services on the UK's top 10 list, FreeVPN.org, has no address on its website and a frighteningly sparse privacy policy.\nMalware is the other significant risk. A 2016 study analyzed 283 Android apps with VPN capability, and found malware in 38% of them. Nor has the threat diminished in the 10 years since — just this year, threat analysts at CYFIRMA reported on a free VPN shared on GitHub being used as a malware vector. \nIn the end, a fully free VPN has no real reason to protect you or your rights, and every incentive to milk you for profit. Whatever you choose to do with a VPN, make sure you're picking one that will keep you save without exploiting you. Green flags include a clear pricing structure, audits from independent firms in the last three years, a specific physical location on the VPN's website and a thorough privacy policy. Some trustworthy free VPNs include the aforementioned Proton VPN, plus hide.me, TunnelBear and Windscribe.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/vpns-are-booming-in-the-uk-after-age-restriction-laws-but-free-options-carry-big-risks-060036636.html?src=rss",

Many of the unique compounds found in maple syrup have been shown to help combat cancer and diabetes. This sweetener is made from the stevia plant, and it's 200 to 400 times sweeter than table sugar. It adds sweetness without much else, which may be what you're looking for when cutting back on sugar. Remember that many stevia products on the market contain other processed ingredients or sugar alcohols, so it's important to do your research before using them. If you're looking for a more nutritionally balanced form of sugar, it's tough to beat raw fruits. Research on other non-nutritive sweeteners shows promising results in terms of weight management and fending off diabetes. The naturally sweet mogrosides in monk fruit also contain antioxidants, which can help with immune health and cancer prevention. While experts don't necessarily consider these drinks \"healthy,\" they can be a better option than traditional sodas. If you can't stand that thought, consider adding other natural enhancers like cinnamon or vanilla extract instead."

According to Reed, most people choose between the following three lens materials for reading glasses: Reed adds that not all lens materials and coatings are created equal. “Price of eyeglasses is not necessarily reflective of quality; the real question is if someone finds the ready-made reading glasses helpful or if they need custom reading glasses to meet their vision needs,” explains Goel.

In a support article for how it plans its routine scheduled maintenance, Valve offered guidance that it prioritizes uptime during business hours in the Pacific time zone (on the US West Coast) when as many of its staff are available to help with issues as possible. Thus, when Valve needs to do planned maintenance, it's scheduled for early mornings or late afternoon Pacific time to avoid peak time while still having staff around to address issues, the company noted in the support article. Valve doesn't announce when its platform goes dark for planned maintenance, nor does it have guidance on any of its social media accounts. But from various posts on the Steam support forum and Reddit, Valve tends to take Steam down for less than an hour for weekly maintenance on Tuesdays starting sometime between 12 p.m. and 3 p.m. PT. However, there's no notification system to warn you in-game when Steam's servers go down, so be careful when playing in that window. How do I check whether Steam is down? Aside from booting up Steam yourself, you can check a third-party service to see if they've reported that the platform is down. The most robust is SteamDB, which monitors access within cities around the world to indicate potential regional outages."

While PayPal has a history of investing in crypto, this move aims to provide easier cross-border transactions and an almost-instant settlement, while reducing transaction fees by up to 90%. This means merchants don't have to handle crypto themselves or worry about price swings since they get paid in dollars or their local money, just like any other transaction. PayPal says this could help businesses save money on fees, especially for international sales. The company says this is part of its bigger plan to make crypto more practical for everyday use, not just investing. CNET reported in April that PayPal had teamed up with Coinbase to offer crypto rewards for its stablecoin PYUSD, as well as new incentives for using its app to manage digital assets. PayPal says Pay With Crypto works seamlessly within its existing checkout experience. When paying online, eligible customers will see crypto as a payment option alongside credit cards and bank accounts. PayPal says the system currently supports 100 cryptocurrencies, with plans to expand. PayPal first opened up crypto buying and selling in 2020, but this is the biggest push so far to make spending it part of everyday online shopping."

    "full_text": "A lawsuit filed last week claims online sellers on platforms like eBay, Amazon, and Walmart are hawking goods that infringe on the Trump Organization’s trademarks. Images filed in The Trump Organization’s lawsuit. The Trump Organization is jumping on a relatively recent legal trend that has swamped certain corners of intellectual property law. Schedule A suits are regularly filed under seal, meaning there isn’t the same level of public transparency. At times, plaintiffs have been able to get extraordinary remedies in court, like getting defendants’ assets frozen — including in a case I wrote about where an Amazon seller was unable to withdraw $50,000 in earnings. These types of lawsuits get their name from the separate “Schedule A” form that’s filed to court — often under seal — listing all the online storefronts being sued. While it’s true that the web is filled with knockoffs, some experts have argued that Schedule A suits at times go overboard and raise due process concerns for the entities being accused of selling infringing products. I’m not a judge or a trademark expert, so I will make no judgment on the merits of The Trump Organization’s claims. Fake (or, to be more precise, unauthorized) Trump merch feels part and parcel with the MAGA ecosystem, whether it’s a homemade Trump yard sign or bloody post-assassination attempt pictures being plastered on T-shirts for sale on Etsy. Then again, perhaps it’s no surprise The Trump Organization would want to consolidate where its MAGA merch is being sold: hawking Trump-themed products is just part of being president now."

Following signs of slowing inflation in late 2024, the Fed implemented three interest rate cuts but has since adopted a more cautious wait-and-see approach this year. Today's complex economic picture presents a challenge for the Fed, which is tasked with maintaining maximum employment and containing inflation. While lower than markets expected, price growth is still well above the Fed's annual target rate of 2%. As a result, experts say the central bank has good reason to keep rate cuts on pause. \"Greater inflation would argue against cutting rates, absent any significant deterioration in labor conditions.\" But Kushi notes that \"any changes, delays or confirmations around tariffs could swing investor sentiment and move yields.\" Generally, housing market experts don't see home loan rates falling below 6% until late 2026 at the earliest. Here are some proven strategies that can help you save up to 1.5% on your mortgage rate. If you can afford it, a down payment of at least 20% will also eliminate private mortgage insurance."

Google didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. Chrome is currently the world's most popular web browser, with 68% global market share, according to GlobalStats by Statcounter. Even though Google has a commanding lead, the desire to fill it with more generative AI features comes as Perplexity, another AI search engine and generative chatbot, launched its own AI-powered web browser earlier this month. Reports are already starting to surfaced that OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, is also prepping the launch of an AI web browser. Advertising is how Google makes a majority of its revenues. Increased competition from AI companies might upend the global browser market, which could spell trouble for Google. Google rose to the top by securing deals with companies like Apple and Samsung, making Google the default option on their devices.

Now it’s sold that platform and delivered a “massive return on investment for Flexport.” Flexport announced the sale on Monday to DAT Freight & Analytics but declined to disclose terms. “Over the past 18 months, we rebuilt and relaunched the [Convoy] platform as a neutral digital freight execution layer that serves brokers, carriers, and shippers across the market,” Flexport founder and CEO Ryan Petersen said in a statement. “That investment paid off. The platform is now stronger, more widely used, and far more valuable than when we acquired it. As the Convoy Platform matured, it was clear that to achieve its full potential, it needed to be a neutral infrastructure layer.” Petersen wrote that the sale of Convoy’s tech will allow his company to “focus our capital and energy on our core business” of helping customers move freight around the world. The sale comes just a few months after Flexport announced the rollout of a suite of AI-powered tools, and a plan to launch waves of new products for its customers twice a year — an approach inspired by Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky. Flexport told TechCrunch at the time that the second product release will come in “late summer.”"

    "full_text": "Google says it has updated its Android Earthquake Alerts System after the tool failed to deliver its most urgent warnings to millions of people during the devastating earthquakes in Turkey in 2023. Instead, Android users received lower-level \"Be Aware\" notifications or nothing at all. Over 70% of phones in Turkey use the company's Android operating system. Apple's competing iOS software does not have a comparable built-in earthquake alert, relying on government warnings. Android's Earthquake Alerts System is available in more than 90 countries and uses tiny vibrations picked up by a phone's accelerometer to spot seismic activity faster than traditional monitoring stations alone. The system has been credited with delivering early warnings during quakes in California, Greece and Japan. The earthquakes in Turkey were unusually complex, involving multiple fault ruptures and powerful aftershocks. This likely made accurate detection harder, but also underscores why timely alerts are so crucial. Earthquake Alerts is enabled by default on many Android phones, and you can check it under Safety & Emergency settings. With climate and seismic risks rising, mobile-based early warning systems can be a way to reach people faster than traditional sirens or broadcasts."

    "summary": "Liquid Glass is a huge new change coming to iOS 26. (Apple)\nThe wait for accessing all the new Apple iOS 26 features is still a couple months away. However, you can now download and install the public beta if you're itching to see what's coming this fall. Prefer more of a guided tour? Check out our preview of the iOS 26 public beta release, which includes the fresh home and lock screen redesign we've been asking to see for years. Dubbed Liquid Glass, the new look and feel will extend across all of Apple's upcoming operating systems. The overhaul was one of several big changes coming to iOS, macOS, iPadOS and the rest of Apple's software suite, all of which were showcased during the company's WWDC keynote on June 9. \nAfter overpromising on AI plans last year, Apple kept its iOS roadmap focused more on basic quality of life improvements this year. There are multiple useful additions coming to the Phone and Messages apps on your iPhone, for instance: Apple execs outlined the ability to weed out spam texts or other unknown senders and an option to hold your spot on a phone call when you've been waiting for a representative to pick up. Plus, a treasured feature that we took for granted is coming back (hint: it's in the Photos app).\nSiri, meanwhile, is in a holding pattern. Apple has previously specified that its smarter voice assistant — first promised at WWDC 2024 — is delayed until some point \"in the coming year,\" so you shouldn't expect any major changes in the current betas. But there are reports that Apple is aiming to give Siri a bigger brain transplant by basing it on third-party artificial intelligence models like OpenAI's ChatGPT or Anthropic's Claude, which could make 2026 a pivotal year.\nWith each beta, it seems like additional new improvements are popping up, like a newly discovered FaceTime feature that'll freeze your video if it detects nudity. Most newer iPhone models are eligible to download iOS 26 (both the betas and final version). Want to see the full list of new features coming this fall? Read on.  \nWhat is iOS 26?\nWhile the current iPhone operating system is iOS 18, Apple is skipping the numbering ahead to iOS 26 later this year. The company has decided to line up its iOS version numbers with a year-based system, similar to car model years. So while iOS and its sibling operating systems will be released in late 2025, they're all designated \"26\" to reflect the year ahead. (Meanwhile, iOS 18 is still getting new versions this summer, too.)\nIt's official, we're moving to iOS 26. (Apple)\nWhat is Liquid Glass design?\nLet's be honest. Out of everything announced at WWDC this year, the new Liquid Glass design was the star of the show. The iPhone's home and lock screens have looked pretty much the same year after year — the last exciting thing (in my opinion) was the option to add your own aesthetic to your home screen by customizing your apps and widgets. So seeing the home and lock screens' new facelift is refreshing.\nSo what exactly is Liquid Glass? Apple calls it a \"new translucent material\" since, well, the apps and widgets are clear. However, the screen can still adapt to dark and light modes, depending on surroundings. You'll also notice buttons with a new floating design in several apps, like Phone and Maps. They're designed to be less distracting than the current buttons, but are still easy to see. While the design overhaul has proven to be controversial since its announcement, some — including Engadget's own Devindra Hardawar — like the new direction, even if it's somewhat reminiscent of Microsoft's translucent Windows Vista Aero designs from nearly twenty years ago.\nThat said, as of the release of the iOS 26 beta 2, Apple has already incorporated some user feedback into the design, dialing back the transparency in at least some places. And while it will continue to evolve, Apple users won't be able to escape it: Liquid Glass was designed to make all of Apple's OSes more cohesive. Here's a look at how the translucent aesthetic will look with the new macOS Tahoe 26 on your desktop.\nWhat are the new and notable features of iOS 26?\niOS 26 has a laundry list of new features. Among the most worthwhile:\nPhone app redesign: You'll finally be able to scroll through contacts, recent calls and voicemail messages all on one screen. It also comes with a new feature called Hold Assist that'll notify you when an agent comes to the phone so you can avoid the elevator music and continue on with other tasks.\nLive Translation in Phone, FaceTime and Messages: iOS 26 is bringing the ability to have a conversation via phone call or text message with someone who speaks another language. Live Translation will translate your conversation in real time, which results in some stop-and-go interactions in the examples Apple shared during its presentation.\nPolls in group chats: Tired of sorting through what seems like hundreds of messages in your group chat? You and your friends will soon be able to create polls in group messages for deciding things like which brunch spot you're eating at or whose car you're taking on a road trip.\nFiltering unknown senders in Messages: If you haven't received spam texts about unpaid tolls or other citations, you're lucky. For those of us who have, those annoying messages will soon be filtered away in a separate folder.\nVisual Intelligence: Similar to a reverse Google image search, this new feature will allow you to search for anything that's on your iPhone screen. For instance, if you spot a pair of shoes someone is wearing in an Instagram photo, you can screenshot it and use Visual Intelligence to find those shoes (or similar ones) online.\nPhotos tabs are back: For anyone who's still frustrated with the Photos changes made last year, you'll be happy to know that your tabs are coming back. Library and Collections will have their own separate spaces so you don't have to scroll to infinity to find what you're looking for.\nFaceTime \"Communication Safety\" feature: A newer addition to iOS 26 appears to be the FaceTime \"Communication Safety\" feature that pauses communications if and when nudity is detected. The feature appears to be a child safety feature that uses on-device detection, thus obviating any cloud-based privacy issues. \nApple's Hold Assist will be nifty for those pesky services that put you on hold for 10 or more minutes. (Apple)\nWhich iPhones will be able to upgrade to iOS 26?\nA few iPhone models that run the current version of iOS — iPhone XR, XS and XS Max — won't be compatible with the latest upgrade. But any iPhones released in 2019 or later will be eligible for the iOS 26 update.\n\niPhone SE (second generation or later)\niPhone 11\niPhone 11 Pro\niPhone 11 Pro Max\niPhone 12\niPhone 12 mini\niPhone 12 Pro\niPhone 12 Pro Max\niPhone 13\niPhone 13 mini\niPhone 13 Pro\niPhone 13 Pro Max\niPhone 14\niPhone 14 Plus\niPhone 14 Pro\niPhone 14 Pro Max\niPhone 15\niPhone 15 Plus\niPhone 15 Pro\niPhone 15 Pro Max\niPhone 16e\niPhone 16\niPhone 16 Plus\niPhone 16 Pro\niPhone 16 Pro Max\n\nNot listed here are the presumed new iPhone 17 models (or maybe iPhone 26?) that are all but certain to be announced and released in September. \nWhen will the iOS 26 beta be available?\nAs of July 24, the iOS 26 public beta is available to download via the Apple Beta Software Program. If you're not already a member, you'll need to sign up to try out all the latest features. Just visit beta.apple.com and sign up with your phone number or email address. It's free.\nOnce you're in, you can install it by going to Settings > General > Software Update and selecting iOS 26 public beta.\nA word of caution: Don't sign up with your main iPhone unless you're OK with any risks that occur with using an OS that isn't finalized.\nWhen will the final version of iOS 26 be released?\niOS 26 will be released to the public this fall. It usually comes in September, within a week of the Apple iPhone event. Last year, it rolled out to iPhone users on September 16 — exactly one week after the iPhone 16 lineup was announced.\nIf you're more interested in the Apple Intelligence features coming, here's everything Apple revealed for iOS, macOS and more during WWDC. Also, check out how iOS 26 screenshots could be an intriguing preview of Apple's delayed Siri rework.\nUpdate, July 24: Noted the iOS 26 public beta is now available.\nUpdate, July 3: Noted new FaceTime feature found in the developer beta.\nUpdate, June 30: Noted ongoing iOS 18 releases, and reports that Apple is considering additional external LLMs for Siri. \nUpdate, June 25: Noted changes added in iOS 26 beta 2. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/apple-ios-26-public-beta-is-live-heres-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-new-iphone-features-and-how-to-use-them-135749325.html?src=rss",

But don't expect to see iOS 19 — it'll be called iOS 26 instead. Included in the list is the new Liquid Glass design (think Windows Vista, but arguably more thoughtful), which looks to be Apple's largest visual update in years. We spent two weeks test-driving it — you can check out our detailed hands-on iOS 26 preview, or you can try it out yourself by downloading and installing the public beta, which became available last week. But first, the biggest question you're probably wondering: Will my iPhone be able to run iOS 26?\nLast year, Apple didn't nix any iPhones from its eligibility list, but that's not the case for 2025 — a few models are getting cut this time. All iPhone 8 models and the iPhone X were the last to get the boot in 2023, and this year the 2018 models are getting left behind. If you have an ineligible device, you won't be able to download iOS 26 when it becomes available this fall.\nWe'll get to the bottom of which iPhones will support iOS 26 this year.

However, you'll miss out on security updates which could potentially put your phone at risk for malware and other threats. Additionally, some apps may stop working if they require a certain version of iOS or later. And of course, you won't be able to access the latest features iOS 26 offers.\nWhen will iOS 26 become available?\nApple usually rolls out its latest iOS in mid-September, just a few days before the new iPhones hit store shelves. Last year, it released iOS 18 on Monday, Sept. 16. Expect a confirmation of the release date at that iPhone 17 event, expected in early September. \niOS 26 features we're excited about\nLiquid Glass design: Your home screen is getting revamped with new app icons, including dark mode and all-clear options.

For example, Microsoft shows how someone might ask the AI companion if a recipe they’re viewing could be made vegan instead, and Copilot suggests substitutions. This type of question is something users might ask an AI chatbot today, but this saves the step of having to paste in the content they want to reference. However, chatting back-and-forth with an AI to go through the options and your needs isn’t necessarily better or faster than just doing it yourself, depending on your familiarity with the website in question. For now, it’s a bit more manual.) This could be useful if they’re doing some type of product comparison or online research, like pricing flights or hotels across multiple sites."

Anthropic tells TechCrunch that most Pro users can expect 40 to 80 hours of Sonnet 4 through Claude Code within their weekly rate limits.

    "full_text": "A report in The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) last week found that prices on Amazon’s low-cost essentials had risen since President Trump announced his plans for massive tariffs on international goods. Amazon responded with a lengthy blog post in response to the article, which describes the WSJ’s reporting as “fundamentally flawed.” WSJ analyzed the prices of 2,500 common Amazon items like cough drops, antibacterial wipes, and chicken broth, determining that the prices of these items increased on average by 5% from Trump’s inauguration on January 20 to July 1. Amazon accused WSJ of “cherry-picking” data and ignoring other factors surrounding the cost of certain products. According to Amazon, some of WSJ’s findings were inaccurate because items like a Dove deodorant and a pack of Yogi Tea bags were on sale in January, when WSJ retrieved its initial pricing data. Amazon says that the price increase on these items occurred due to the promotion ending, not inflation or tariffs. Amazon’s pricing is often dynamic, leading to fluctuations, which is why a random sampling across products at a point in time makes sense for an analysis like this. That Amazon felt it had to respond to this report suggests the company is sensitive about the topic and could even fear retaliation from the Trump administration. Amazon costs aside, customers may observe slight upticks in costs on popular items. Per the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ June report, consumer prices rose 0.3% on the month, or 2.7% on the year."

But Liss isn’t pitching Nemo as just another piece of industrial software. Hyundai Motor Group said in March that it would build a $6 billion steel plant in Louisiana to supply its factories in the U.S. Nemo’s plant may not cost that much since its operations will be focused on pig iron, an intermediate product that steelmakers use to make a range of different alloys. “He’s built billions of dollars in LNG infrastructure,” Liss said. The startup will need that sort of scale if it’s to succeed. It’s a tall order for anyone to tackle, but Liss said that sort of ambition is required if the steel industry is going to deliver the sort of returns desired by venture capitalists. “When you look at the history of our country, many of the greatest companies that created outsize outcomes for their initial investors were in these categories,” Liss said."

We update this guide regularly with the latest prices, so if you’re thinking of buying an Apple product, check here first to see if you can save some cash. \nBest MacBook deals\n \nApple MacBook Air (15-inch, M4) for $999 ($200 off): The 15-inch MacBook Air is nearly identical to the smaller version but features more robust speakers and a more spacious trackpad alongside its roomier display. $999 is the lowest price we've tracked. \nApple MacBook Air (15-inch, M3, 24GB RAM) for $1,299 ($400 off): The last-gen M3 MacBook Air has officially been discontinued, but it remains a superb laptop while the last bits of stock remain available. We gave this 15-inch model a score of 90 in our review — outside of its slower chip (which is still plenty fast for everyday use), marginally improved camera and inability to power two external displays with the lid open, it's virtually identical to the newer version. This deal applies to the model with the larger 24GB of memory in the Starlight colorway.\nApple iMac 24-inch (M4) for $1,149 ($150 off): For an all-in-one solution, the M4 iMac is a good pick thanks to its powerful performance, standard 16GB of RAM and improved webcam. Just note that it only comes in the 24-inch screen size option. $1,149 is the lowest price we've tracked, but note that the deal only applies to the Pink model. Other colors are also on sale, but more expensive. \nBest Apple Watch deals\n \nApple Watch Ultra 2 for $650 ($149 off): Apple’s most premium smartwatch, the Ultra 2 has a killer 36-hour battery life, a handy Low Power mode for extended use and cellular connectivity by default. It also has a compass app, water temperature gauge and a loud onboard siren that you can trigger in emergencies. This deal applies to the watch with the orange band. $650 is the lowest price we've tracked. \nApple Watch SE for $169 (32 percent off) at Walmart: We wouldn’t be surprised to see an update to Apple’s budget smartwatch sometime soon (and we have a few suggestions on the matter). But thanks to some serious discounts, the Apple Watch SE has turned out to be the most affordable way to get an iPhone companion for your wrist. Despite the lackluster screen and limited extra features, it handles the basics well. \nBest AirPods deals\nAirPods Max (USB-C) for $450 ($99 off): If you’re looking for over-ear headphones with all of the conveniences of in-ear AirPods, the AirPods Max are one of your only options (with the others being Beats devices). The latest models have the same design as the originals, but now charge up via USB-C instead of Lightning. They went as low as $430 for Amazon's Prime Day. \nAirPods 4 without ANC for $99 ($30 off): If you don't need active noise cancellation, you can grab Apple's most affordable earbuds, the AirPods 4 without ANC. These came out last September at the same time as the latest iPhone. Engadget's Billy Steele reviewed them and appreciated their comfort, improved sound quality and advanced features like voice isolation for calls and Personalized Spatial Audio. Also at Walmart. They went as low as $89 for Amazon's Prime Day. \nBest iPad deals\n \niPad Pro (M4, 11-inch) for $899 ($100 off): The most powerful iPad is the iPad Pro, and it’s the one to get if you’re even toying with the idea of using your new slab as a laptop replacement. Both the 11- and 13-inch models have gorgeous displays, thinner and lighter designs, a repositioned front camera and the excessively powerful M4 chip inside. Also at B&H Photo.\nBest Apple accessories deals\nApple Pencil (USB-C) for $69 ($10 off): This more affordable Apple Pencil doesn’t support pressure sensitivity, but it still makes for a useful stylus for the basics. If you’re a casual note-taker and can live without wireless charging, you’ll save a few bucks by picking this one up. Also available at Walmart.\nApple Pencil (2nd gen) for $99 ($30 off): The Second gen Pencil both attaches and charges magnetically, supports tilt and pressure sensitivity and allows for tool changes with a tap of the flat edge. It’s an older pencil and isn’t compatible with the latest iPad models. This is the lowest price we’ve tracked this year, but it went as low as $80 for last year’s Black Friday sales.\nRead more Apple coverage:\n\nThe best AirPods\nThe best Apple Watches\nThe best MacBooks\nThe best iPhones\nThe best iPads\n\nFollow @EngadgetDeals on X for the latest tech deals and buying advice.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/best-apple-deals-150020110.html?src=rss",

    "full_text": "When reached for comment, Google could not confirm if or when AI summaries would come to mobile devices. Google says the goal with the summaries is to provide a safer and more efficient shopping experience. However, the feature also helps Google better compete with other AI features rolled out by retail giant Amazon, which has been using the new technology to summarize product ratings and reviews, help customers find clothes that fit, get product recommendations and comparisons, and more. The changes arrive as Google, for the first time in many years, is facing a potential competitive threat to Chrome’s dominance in the global browser market. New AI-powered browsers like Perplexity’s Comet, The Browser Company’s Dia, Opera Neon, and perhaps a challenger from OpenAI have the search giant thinking about how to infuse AI more directly into its own web browser. For example, Google is developing an AI agent that would be able to take control of Chrome for you to take actions on your behalf. Plus, the company recently added support for its Gemini AI assistant in Chrome for Gemini subscribers. The move is also part of a broader initiative underway at Google to make it more of a modern-day shopping platform for consumers. (The latter two were announced at this year’s Google I/O developer conference. Google recently announced that getting outfit and room inspiration in AI Mode would roll out this fall.)"

The trailer introduces us to all of the major characters, more or less, all while chancellor Holly Hunter does her best space Dumbledore and delivers a rousing speech.\n\nEagle-eyed fans, however, will notice an abundance of Easter eggs in this footage. Starfleet Academy is where nearly every major Star Trek character in franchise history went to school, and they've all left their footprints here. There are shoutouts to James Kirk, Wesley Crusher, Tom Paris and, most interestingly, a class that examines the ultimate fate of Deep Space Nine head honcho Benjamin Sisko.\nThe trailer also re-introduces two fan-favorite characters from previous installments. Robert Picardo returns as the holographic doctor from Star Trek: Voyager and the one-and-only Tig Notaro returns as snark-mouthed engineer Jett Reno from Star Trek: Discovery.

Starfleet Academy is set in the 32nd century, after the crew of the Discovery accidentally ended up there at the end of season two. This is 800 years after the 90s shows like The Next Generation and 900 years after the original series. So this means any and all connections between planets and species are likely to be radically different, as eight centuries is a really, really long time. Just think about how different the year 1225 was from today.\nThe show premieres in six or seven months on Paramount+.

    "summary": "On July 23, the Trump Administration released its long-awaited AI Action Plan. Short of copyright exemptions for model training, the administration appears ready to give OpenAI, Anthropic, Google and other major players nearly everything they asked of the White House during public consultation. However, according to Travis Hall, the director of state engagement at the Center for Democracy and Technology, Trump's policy vision would put states, and tech companies themselves, in a position of \"extraordinary regulatory uncertainty.\"\nIt starts with Trump's attempt to prevent states from regulating AI systems. In the original draft of his recently passed tax megabill, the president included an amendment that would have imposed a 10-year moratorium on any state-level AI regulation. Eventually, that clause was removed from the legislation in a decisive 99-1 vote by the Senate.\nIt appears Trump didn't get the message. In his Action Plan, the president signals he will order federal agencies to only award \"AI-related\" funding to states without \"burdensome\" AI regulations.\n\"It is not really clear which discretionary funds will be deemed to be 'AI-related', and it's also not clear which current state laws — and which future proposals — will be deemed 'burdensome' or as 'hinder[ing] the effectiveness' of federal funds. This leaves state legislators, governors, and other state-level leaders in a tight spot,\" said Grace Gedye, policy analyst for Consumer Reports. \"It is extremely vague, and I think that is by design,\" adds Hall.\nThe issue with the proposal is nearly any discretionary funding could be deemed AI-related. Hall suggests a scenario where a law like the Colorado Artificial Intelligence Act (CAIA), which is designed to protect people against algorithmic discrimination, could be seen as hindering funding meant to provide schools with technology enrichment because they plan to teach their students about AI.\nThe potential for a \"generous\" reading of \"AI-related\" is far-reaching. Everything from broadband to highway infrastructure funding could be put at risk because machine learning technologies have begun to touch every part of modern life.\nOn its own, that would be bad enough, but the president also wants the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to evaluate whether state AI regulations interfere with its \"ability to carry out its obligations and authorities under the Communications Act of 1934.\" If Trump were to somehow enact this part of this plan, it would transform the FCC into something very different from what it is today.\n\"The idea that the FCC has authority over artificial intelligence is really extending the Communications Act beyond all recognition,\" said Cody Venzke, senior policy counsel at the American Civil Liberties Union. \"It traditionally has not had jurisdiction over things like websites or social media. It's not a privacy agency, and so given the fact that the FCC is not a full-service technology regulator, it's really hard to see how it has authority over AI.\"\nHall notes this part of Trump's plan is particularly worrisome in light of how the president has limited the agency's independence. In March, Trump illegally fired two of the FCC's Democratic commissioners. In July, the Commission's sole remaining Democrat, Anna Gomez, accused Republican Chair Brendan Carr of \"weaponizing\" the agency \"to silence critics.\"\n\"It's baffling that the president is choosing to go it alone and unilaterally try to impose a backdoor state moratorium through the FCC, distorting their own statute beyond recognition by finding federal funds that might be tangentially related to AI and imposing new conditions on them,\" said Venzke.\nIgor Bonifacic for Engadget\nOn Wednesday, the president also signed three executive orders to kick off his AI agenda. One of those, titled \"Preventing Woke AI in the Federal Government,\" limits federal agencies to only obtaining those AI systems that are \"truth-seeking,\" and free of ideology. \"LLMs shall be neutral, nonpartisan tools that do not manipulate responses in favor of ideological dogmas such as DEI,\" the order states. \"LLMs shall prioritize historical accuracy, scientific inquiry, and objectivity, and shall acknowledge uncertainty where reliable information is incomplete or contradictory.\"\nThe pitfalls of such a policy should be obvious. \"The project of determining what is absolute truth and ideological neutrality is a hopeless task,\" said Venzke. \"Obviously you don't want government services to be politicized, but the mandates and executive order are not workable and leave serious questions.\"\n\"It's very apparent that their goal is not neutrality,\" adds Hall. \"What they're putting forward is, in fact, a requirement for ideological bias, which is theirs, and which they're calling neutral. With that in mind, what they're actually requiring is that LLMs procured by the federal government include their own ideological bias and slant.\"\nTrump's executive order creates an arbitrary political test that companies like OpenAI must pass or risk losing government contracts — something AI firms are actively courting. At the start of the year, OpenAI debuted ChatGPT Gov, a version of its chatbot designed for government agency use. xAI announced Grok for Government last week. \"If you're building LLMs to satisfy government procurement requirements, there's a real concern that it's going to carry over to wider private uses,\" said Venzke.\nThere's a greater likelihood of consumer-facing AI products conforming to these same reactionary parameters if the Trump administration should somehow find a way to empower the FCC to regulate AI. Under Brendan Carr, the Commission has already used its regulatory power to strongarm companies to align with the president's stance on diversity, equity and inclusion. In May, Verizon won FCC approval for its $20 billion merger with Frontier after promising to end all DEI-related practices. Skydance made a similar commitment to close its $8 billion acquisition of Paramount Global.\nEven without direct government pressure to do so, Elon Musk's Grok chatbot has demonstrated twice this year what a \"maximally truth-seeking\" outcome can look like. First, in mid-May it made unprompted claims about \"white genocide\" in South Africa; more recently it went full \"MechaHitler\" and took a hard turn toward anti-semitism.\nAccording to Venzke, Trump's entire plan to preempt states from regulating AI is \"probably illegal,\" but that's a small comfort when the president has actively flouted the law far too many times to count less than a year into his second term, and the courts haven't always ruled against his behavior.\n\"It is possible that the administration will read the directives from the AI Action Plan narrowly and proceed in a thoughtful way about the FCC jurisdiction, about when federal programs actually create a conflict with state laws, and that is a very different conversation. But right now, the administration has opened the door to broad, sort of reckless preemption of state laws, and that is simply going to pave the way for harmful, not effective, AI.\"This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/everyones-a-loser-in-trumps-ai-action-plan-160023247.html?src=rss",

The letter specifically called out H20’s AI inference, the process of using a trained AI model to make decisions on unseen data. “The H20 is a potent accelerator of China’s frontier AI capabilities, not an outdated AI chip,” the letter stated. For inference tasks, the H20 outperforms even the H100, an AI chip this administration has restricted access to due to its advanced capabilities.” They’re here to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

    "summary": "When it comes to audio performance, Bowers & Wilkins is on a hot streak. The company manages to consistently offer balanced and detailed sound across its line of headphones and earbuds. The Px7 and Px8 lines have been mainstays on our best headphones list for a while now, primarily for their outstanding audio quality. With the Px7 S3 ($449), the company updated a previous model with changes to its sound platform and some subtle design tweaks. And that combination continues an upward trajectory that shows no signs of slowing down.\n \nWhat’s good about the Px7 S3?\nBowers & Wilkins has been crafting a superb mix of sound and design for a while now. That run of form continues on the Px7 S3 with an audio platform that’s powered by 40mm bio cellulose drivers, discrete headphone amplifiers and a 24-bit audio connection. There’s also support for the full suite of aptX codecs (Lossless, Adaptive, HD and Classic) as well as TrueSound mode. That latter item is a dedicated audio profile that the company says “allows you to hear music and movies with the striking accuracy and realism of the original recording, with nothing added and nothing taken away.” \nAll of that combines for some truly stellar audio performance on the Px7 S3. The sound is crisp and detailed, even offering nuance to more bass-heavy and chaotic genres. I heard some particular elements in the percussion on Turnstile’s “DULL” that I hadn’t noticed before on other headphones or earbuds. You can also hear the band’s use of guitar effects to a greater degree on this model (hello reverb and chorus). Plus, even at their most raucous, tracks have nice separation so that all of the instruments gain an airy, atmospheric quality rather than sounding compressed.\nI honestly couldn’t tell much of a difference between the stock tuning and the TrueSound mode. I think that’s a testament to the device’s sonic prowess out of the box. But, if you find that you do need to make a change, there’s a full 5-band EQ available for that.\n\n\n\n\n   Billy Steele for Engadget \n \n\nBowers & Wilkins says it “greatly upgraded” its active noise cancellation (ANC) setup on the Px7 S3. It added two more microphones on this model, so there are now eight total units with an even split on each ear cup. ANC has always been… fine on the company’s headphones, but it never came close to the supreme world-blocking capabilities of Bose or Sony. Here, there is noticeable improvement, but TV sounds, human voices and constant noise from planes, fans and sound machines still cut through.\nOther improvements on the Px7 S3 include slight changes to the design of the headphones. Bowers & Wilkins slimmed down the ear cups and refined the headband, and these two updates offer a sleeker silhouette and improve overall comfort. There’s still the mix of metal, leather and textured fabric from the Px7 S2 and Px7 S2e, with the only obvious aesthetic change being a new ridged ring around the earcups. There’s no doubt the company has created a sophisticated look, but it would be nice to see some bigger design changes now that three consecutive models have looked nearly identical.\nBowers & Wilkins claims you’ll get 30 hours of battery life on a charge with the Px7 S3. As it has in the past, the company doesn’t specify if this is with ANC on or off. The company has a habit of understating its runtime stats though, and the Px7 S3 continues that trend. After 15 hours of what I’d consider “normal” use — mostly with ANC active, but several times with ambient sound on for calls — I had over 60 percent left in the tank. Better-than-stated battery life is never a bad thing, so just know you’ll probably outlast the company’s numbers in that regard.\nWhat’s not so good about the Px7 S3?\n\n\n\n\n   Billy Steele for Engadget \n \n\nThe first strike against the Px7 S3 is its price. At $449, this model is $50 more than its predecessors in the Px7 line. Sure, everything is more expensive these days with the constant churn that is tariffs and other financial uncertainties, but it’s still worth considering that Bowers & Wilkins is asking you to pay more for its upgrades this time around.\nThe next issue I have with the Px7 S3 is the location of its controls. On the Px7 S2e, the buttons were on the edge of the ear cups — a positioning that’s common among the competition. For this model though, Bowers & Wilkins moved the controls to the edge of the smaller panels where the headband connects to the ear cups. As such, the ledge or lip there is skinnier, so the buttons are more cumbersome to find with your thumb. This may seem like nitpicking, but it’s a change that impacted the overall experience for me as someone who is constantly testing headphones.\nBowers & Wilkins typically focuses on the basics when it comes to its headphones. This means you’ll get excellent sound quality, capable ANC and some audio customizability, but that’s about it. The same holds true for the Px7 S3, as you won’t find any advanced features here that companies like Sony and others may tack on for your convenience. There’s no automatic pausing when you start to speak or sound profiles that can be set to change based on location. It also lacks voice detection for your phone’s assistant and doesn’t offer advertised support for spatial audio. While any number of these could help soften the blow of that $449 price tag, I’d argue the sound is so good you’ll likely be satisfied despite the limited set of features.\nFinal verdict on the Px7 S3\nBowers & Wilkins has been taking an “if it ain’t broke, slightly tweak it” approach to its Px7 line for a while now, but the S3 version is a more robust upgrade than the previous release. However, the company’s updates are mostly on the inside, with further enhancements to an already stellar sound profile and slight ANC improvements. There are some changes on the outside too, but I’d like to see the company make some bigger strides there the next time it sees fit to “slightly tweak” this model.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/bowers--wilkins-px7-s3-review-a-sonic-powerhouse-only-slightly-improved-130027301.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Streaming services keep raising prices. At this point, if you subscribe to all the major services out there, you're basically paying the same price as cable — those antiquated local monopolies that streaming was supposed to save us from. But streaming still has one big advantage over the old ways: no contracts. That means you can grab a good streaming deal and then cancel without penalty.\nOur advice is to sign up for a service when you see a good streaming deal (or the latest season of, say, Doctor Who, Severance, Andor and/or The Last of Us). Then, when the deal ends or you've binged whatever it is you want to watch, cancel as needed. But streaming deals don't come around all that often and, when they do, it's easy to miss them thanks to...everything. So we're keeping eyes out for the best streaming deals out there and we update this guide often — so check it out the next time you have a hankering to watch something new. \nBest streaming deals\nTrue streaming deals can be hard to come by. Most often, they’ll pop up during the Black Friday shopping period. On occasion, we’ll see them sparingly throughout the year and they usually take the form of a discounted monthly or annual rate for a limited period of time. Also, true streaming deals are typically on the ad-supported versions of a service, but once in a while you’ll find a unicorn of a deal on a tier that has ad-free viewing.\nIf you’re able to wait for a deal before subscribing to a streaming service, we recommend doing so. You’ll save money upfront and in the long run, and you also have the option to cancel your subscription before the price goes back up to the normal rate. Maybe you find you like the service so much that you’re fine paying full price for it — that’s the ideal situation. But if you’re not compelled to keep that app on rotation in your smart TV, most streaming services make it easy for you to cancel at any time. With that said, these are the best streaming deals you can snag right now.\n \nSling Orange for $23/month for the first month (50 percent off): New customers can get Sling Orange or Sling Blue for half off the usual price for the first month, bringing the final prices to $23/month and $25.50/month, respectively. Orange is likely best for sports fans, with eight exclusive sports and family channels, while Blue includes 19 exclusive news and entertainment channels. You can get both Orange and Blue access also for half off for one month, or $33 total.\nYouTube TV (two months) for $120 ($46 off): You can get two months of our favorite live TV streaming service for $60 per month which works out to $46 less than paying the full $83 each month. And right now, the service is free for the first 21 days. That should give you a decent chunk of time to see if the service is right for you. The discount and trial are only open to new subscribers to YouTube TV’s base plan, which includes access to over 100 channels, unlimited DVR space and six household accounts with the ability to stream on three devices at once. The deal ends July 31.\nFubo Pro for $65/month for the first month ($20 off): Fubo has introductory discounts on most of its packages, and the Pro package is the least expensive plan currently listed. It offers access to 224 channels, unlimited cloud DVR and up to 10 simultaneous streams. It even includes regional sports content from the NHL, MLB and NBA.\nSling TV + MLB.TV for $30 off: New subscribers can get $30 off their first month of Sling TV when they sign up and add MLB.TV to their package. The offer applies to Sling Orange, Sling Blue and Sling Orange & Blue, and MLB.TV gives you access to MLB Network along with access to all out-of-market games during the regular season. This offer runs through May 31.\nSpotify Premium Individual (1 month) for $0 ($12 off): This is our favorite music streaming service for podcasts and social features. Right now, users who have not signed up for Spotify's Premium service before are eligible to get one month for free. The Premium Individual plan lets you listen ad-free and skip songs at will. You can also organize your listening queue and download content for offline listening. Just be aware, your subscription will auto-renew at the end of the trial period. So if you don't want to be on the hook for the $12 monthly fee, set a reminder to cancel and go back to the free version.\nHBO Max student discount — subscribe for $5/month (50 percent off): HBO Max offers their ad-supported tier to students for half off the usual rate. You’ll just have to verify that you’re a student through Unidays, and make note that this offer is only good for up to 12 months of service.\nHulu student discount — subscribe for $2/month (75 percent off): Those with a valid student ID can get Hulu’s ad-supported tier for 75 percent off the typical rate. They’ll keep the same sale price for as long as they’re a student as well.\nSpotify student discount — Premium + Hulu with ads for $6/month (72 percent off): Spotify’s student offer continues to be one of the best around, giving you access to the Premium tier of the music streamer and Hulu’s ad-supported plan for only $6 monthly. Purchased separately, you’d pay $22 per month for both of the services. Plus, the first month is free when you sign up.\nNBA League Pass student discount — one year for $120 (40 percent off): Students can get one year of League Pass for only $10 per month, which includes access to NBA TV and the ability to watch classic and archive games on-demand. On the NBA League Pass website, look for the student discount banner at the top and follow the instructions to verify your student status.\nPeacock first responders discount — one year for $48 (50 percent off): Medical professionals and first responders can save 50 percent each year of Peacock. The deal requires annual verification and is open to those who work for either private or public institutions. Peacock has some great stuff to watch, including Poker Face and Killing It and more.\nStreaming bundle discounts\nThere’s more consolidation happening now than ever before in the streaming space, and that means there are more streaming bundle options. These bundles offer you access to more content with one subscription price, but those prices are typically higher than paying for a single service by itself (obviously). It may be tempting to just get the bundle, but if only one of those services in the bundle speaks to you, you’ll spend less overall by just paying for the single service.\nSpeaking of a deep love for a single streaming service: if all of your favorite shows are on Peacock or the latest releases on HBO Max consistently bring you joy, consider paying for one year upfront. Subscribing with an annual plan usually saves you money in the long term over paying on a monthly basis. Unfortunately, not all streaming services (looking at you, Netflix) have an annual subscription option. Here are some of the best streaming bundles you can get right now.\n \nDisney+, Hulu, HBO Max bundle with ads for $17/month: Ad-supported HBO Max is included here, along with full, ad-supported access to Disney+ and Hulu. You’ll save 43 percent with this bundle, as opposed to paying for all three services individually.\nDisney+ and Hulu Bundle Premium for $20/month: Disney and Hulu offer a few different bundles, which you can view in the drop-down lists under Choose Your Plan. This bundle removes the ads from both Disney+ and Hulu (with the exception of select live and linear content) and allows you to download content for offline viewing. You’ll save 42 percent with this bundle, as opposed to paying for both ad-free tiers individually.\nParamount+ with Showtime for $13/month or $120/year: This includes everything in Paramount+’s Essential plan, except the ads, and also provides access to Showtime content, live CBS streams and download features.\nSling TV + HBO Max starting at $53/month: Sling TV and HBO Max have partnered on a discount that gives new subscribers 50 percent off their first month of Sling TV, plus $5 off monthly when you subscribe to the Sling TV + HBO Max bundle. The standard price for the Sling Blue + HBO Max duo is roughly $58/month, so you'll get a monthly discount of $5 off that. In addition, for the first month only, you'll get half off the price of the bundle. The promotion also applies to the Sling Orange & Blue + HBO Max package, which has a standard price of $73/month.\nHulu + Live TV with Disney+ and ESPN+ for $96/month: This streaming bundle amalgamation is a bit confusing but it does offer a lot: you get live TV streaming via Hulu’s service plus access to the following VOD services: Hulu, Disney+ and ESPN+. Out of those three, only ESPN+ will have ads.\nDisney+, Hulu, ESPN+ Bundle Basic for $17/month: You get full access to Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+ content with this package, albeit with ads across the board. This bundle price is 46 percent off the total price of all three separate subscriptions.\nDisney+, Hulu, ESPN+ Bundle Premium for $27/month: Similarly to the Duo bundles, the Premium version of the Trio removes ads from most content in Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+, and you can download content for offline viewing. This price represents a 43-percent savings when compared to paying for all three ad-free tiers separately.\nRead more streaming coverage\n\nThe best live TV streaming services to cut cable\nThe best streaming services: Netflix, Hulu, HBO Max and more\nThe best streaming devices\n\nFollow @EngadgetDeals on X for the latest tech deals and buying advice.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/best-streaming-service-deals-133028980.html?src=rss",

    "full_text": "I can recommend Cocoon to anyone that plays video games, and plenty who don’t. Cocoon is the debut game from Geometric Interactive, a studio founded by former Playdead employees Jeppe Carlsen and Jakob Schmid. You play as a beetle, navigating a strange land filled with (and contained within) orbs. The controls are incredibly simple: Move with an analog stick and interact with a single button. It’s reminiscent of Tunic or Hyper Light Drifter in its lack of dialogue and tutorials. The orbs, carried on the beetle’s little back, are central to gameplay, unlocking specific abilities and allowing players to jump into different worlds at will. The game introduces just a handful of mechanics, and each of those are matched and remixed in truly creative ways. I appreciate a game being as long as its developer wants it to be, but the bones here are so good, so satisfying, that I can’t help feeling it can hold up to more orbs, more puzzles. That said, the seven hours I spent with Cocoon are among the most memorable of this decade, and I’ll definitely be returning to it in a couple of years, once my brain has purged all of the answers to its puzzles. — Aaron Souppouris, Executive Editor"

    "summary": "Foldable phones have gone from futuristic novelties to genuinely useful devices that blend portability with big-screen versatility. Whether you're into multitasking, mobile gaming or just love having a phone that turns heads, the best foldable phones you can buy offer powerful performance, durable designs and impressive displays that unfold to reveal more room for apps, videos and productivity.From book-style designs to flip-style clamshells, the best foldable phone for you depends on how you like to use your device. Some models focus on flagship-level power and multitasking features, while others aim to keep things compact and stylish. Either way, these folding handsets are pushing the boundaries of what smartphones can do.Note: For this guide, we’re focusing on devices that are widely available in North America and Europe. That’s because while there are even more options for people who live in Asia (especially China), they are often difficult to buy from abroad and may not support your local carriers.\nTable of contents\n\nBest foldable phones for 2025\nHow we test foldable phones\nAre foldable phones worth it? A note on durability\nFoldable phone FAQs\n\nBest foldable phones for 2025\n \n \n \n \n \n \nHow we test foldable phones\nWhen evaluating new foldable phones, we consider the same general criteria as we do when we’re judging the best smartphones. Devices need to have good battery life (at least a full day’s use), bright inner displays (peaks of at least 1,000 nits), sharp cameras and responsive performance. That said, foldable phones come in different shapes (and sizes); there are varying designs that may appeal to different types of people. \nFor those who prefer more compact and stylish devices, flip phone-style foldables resemble old-school namesakes but with flexible interior displays (typically six to seven inches diagonally) and smaller outer screens, often referred to as the cover display. Alternatively, for power users and people who want to maximize mobile productivity, there are larger book-style foldables (with seven to eight-inch main displays) that can transform from a candy bar-style phone to essentially a small tablet when opened.\nAre foldable phones worth it? A note on durability\nAside from their displays, the biggest difference between foldable phones and more traditional handsets is durability. That’s because while some models like the Pixel 9 Pro Fold and Samsung’s foldables offer IPX8 water resistance (which is good for submersions of up to five feet for 30 minutes), their flexible screens – which are largely made from plastic – present some unique challenges.\nMost foldables come with factory-installed screen protectors. However, unlike regular phones, users are instructed not to remove them without assistance from approved service centers. Thankfully, Samsung phones do offer one free screen protector replacement for its foldables, while Google charges between $29 and $129 depending on the warranty status of your device. That said, while we can’t do long-term testing for every new foldable phone on the market, after personally using the Galaxy Z Fold 3 and Galaxy Z Fold 4 each for a year, I’ve found that Samsung’s pre-installed screen protector tends to start bubbling nine to 12 months after purchase. So you’ll probably want to factor in that your foldable may need some sort of servicing after about a year unless you plan on removing the screen protector entirely (which is possible, but goes against most manufacturers' instructions).\nFurthermore, foldable phone owners need to be mindful about keeping sharp objects away from their flexible displays, as rocks, keys or even pressing down very hard with a fingernail can leave permanent marks. In the event that you need to get a flexible screen serviced, you’re potentially facing a much higher repair bill when compared to a typical phone (up to $500 or more depending on the model and the severity of the damage). In short, while the ruggedness of foldable phones has improved a lot, they're still more delicate than traditional handsets, which is something you need to account for.\nHowever, foldables continue to evolve, with better AI features, improved specs and a more refined form factors that makes them even more practical. Whether you’re after a flip phone for nostalgia or a big screen device for multitasking, today’s foldable phones offer exciting possibilities — you just have to decide if they’re the right fit for you.\nFoldable phone FAQs\nWhat is the difference between a foldable phone and a flip phone?\nFoldable and flip phones both use flexible displays, but the way they fold — and what that means for usability — is different. A foldable phone typically opens like a book, giving you a larger tablet-like screen inside, which is great for multitasking or media. A flip phone, on the other hand, folds vertically to become more compact, kind of like the classic clamshell phones of the early 2000s. Flip phones are more pocket-friendly, while foldables offer more screen real estate when open.\nWhat is the disadvantage of a foldable phone?\nThe biggest trade-offs with foldable phones are price and durability. They're often more expensive than traditional smartphones, thanks to the complex hinge mechanisms and flexible displays. Battery life can sometimes take a hit too, especially with larger screens. And while the tech has come a long way, foldables can still be a bit bulkier and not quite as seamless as regular slab phones when it comes to everyday use.\nAre foldable phones less durable than other phones?\nGenerally, yes — at least for now. Foldable phones use flexible displays and intricate hinges, which can be more prone to wear and tear over time compared to standard phones with solid glass screens. That said, newer models have gotten tougher with improved hinge designs, water resistance and stronger ultra-thin glass. They're definitely more durable than they used to be, but they still require a bit more care than your average smartphone.\nGeorgie Peru contributed to this report.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/best-foldable-phones-160030013.html?src=rss",

Note: For this guide, we’re focusing on devices that are widely available in North America and Europe. That still isn’t cheap, but it pushes the Open closer to being somewhat affordable. It’s another smart improvement that makes the Flip 7 easier to use than its predecessors. Sadly there’s still no dedicated telephoto lens, which makes it less useful in some shooting situations. It’s available in three colors, with the magenta model featuring a soft vegan leather back. Starting at £800 (U.S. pricing still TBA), it’s one of the least expensive options on sale today.

    "summary": "When we say that NordVPN is a good VPN that's not quite great, it's important to put that in perspective. Building a good VPN is hard, as evidenced by all the shovelware VPNs flooding the market. NordVPN may not be perfect, but it's easily top-five caliber and excels in certain use cases.\nFirst, the bad: NordVPN's apps could all stand to undergo a little more quality control, with elements distracting from other elements and inconsistent designs from platform to platform. At least one of its FAQ pages directly contradicts itself. And while all the server locations could unblock Netflix, the one in Nigeria still showed U.S. content, indicating that our real location might have leaked. \nHowever, there's a lot of good to balance that out. Speeds are fantastic and we saw no other hint of any kind of leak. Its server network is expansive and not overly reliant on virtual locations. The vast majority of servers are ideal for unblocking foreign websites. The real draw, though, is the extra features, including the innovative and flexible Meshnet, plus a malware blocker that acts more like a full antivirus and forward-looking quantum resistant encryption.\nEditors' note: We're in the process of revamping our VPN coverage to provide more in-depth, actionable information and buying guides. Our recommendations, and all the info on this page, are subject to change as the update continues.

User experience is important, but it's not quite as front-and-center as it is with ExpressVPN and Proton VPN. Here's how the apps run on all the major platforms.\nWindows\nThe Windows app is the first instance of NordVPN's UI being not bad enough to complain about, but not good enough to be considered excellent. The initial connection process is a little slow, and it's far easier to connect than it is to disconnect (click the power button while connected to shut the VPN off). The map takes up space that would have been better allocated to the server list.\n\n\n\n\n   Sam Chapman for Engadget \n \n\nThe minor problems continue in the settings list, which makes the mistake of not keeping all its tabs visible in the window — if you open one, you have to click back to the main menu to reach another page. The pages themselves are easy to use; it's just a bit clunkier than it could have been.\nMac\nSetup is swift and easy on Mac, but the full NordVPN interface is a little awkward. The vast majority of the main window is taken up by a large map, which is mostly useless. There's no way to zoom out to see the whole world, and you can't choose between servers in each country unless you zoom way in. The server list on the left-hand side is almost always more useful.\n\n\n\n\n   Sam Chapman for Engadget \n \n\nThe preferences panel is better. All the tabs come with clear explanations of their function, and are laid out so the menu is always visible, unlike the Windows app. The gear icon at the bottom includes its own set of tabs that encompass most of the common functions, including changing your VPN protocol, activating the kill switch and setting the VPN to automatically connect on untrusted networks.\nAndroid\nNordVPN on mobile can be described in much the same way as its desktop apps: generally great, occasionally getting in its own way. On Android, the map screen is much more helpful. It's expandable to the entire world and allows you to choose between servers within a country. On the other hand, the important settings are buried in the Profile tab, and the app notifies you about your \"security score\" to pressure you into activating certain settings.\n\n\n\n\n   Sam Chapman for Engadget \n \n\nTo find the general settings page on Android, tap the bottom-right Profile tab and scroll down. Except for Threat Protection, which has its own tab on the main window, every feature is located here. It's probably necessary to keep the main app from getting cluttered, but still mildly frustrating.\niOS\nThe NordVPN iOS app resembles a compressed version of the macOS client, for better or worse. As with Android, most of its features are in the bottom-right Profile tab. It works well most of the time, but often feels slightly cumbersome. There's a bit too much on the screen, and a bit too much of the stuff has nothing to do with the VPN's core function.\n\n\n\n\n   Sam Chapman for Engadget \n \n\nAs an example, you can't log into your account within the app — you have to load your Nord account page in a web browser. Forced app switching is a design choice that truly needs to die. That said, VPN connections happen quickly. If you tend to simply leave your VPN active, you probably won't notice any of this stuff.\nBrowser extensions\nMost VPN browser extensions consist of the same features on a smaller scale, and NordVPN's — on Chrome, Firefox and Edge — are no exception. They are important for one reason, though: they're the only way to split tunnels by URL and the only split tunneling at all on macOS and iOS. Despite being more compact, they're also easy to use, making for an excellent quick-start VPN solution.\n\n\n\n\n   Sam Chapman for Engadget \n \n\nNordVPN speed test\nAll VPNs slow down your average browsing speeds by adding extra steps into the connection process. When we test speed, we're looking for the VPN to drag as little as possible on your unprotected speeds. Download speed will be the most important stat for most users, since that determines how fast web pages load and how quickly videos can buffer.\nLatency is important for live connections like video chats, games and live streaming. Latency increases with distance — in the test below, data packets were sent to the remote server, then back to our home network. Upload speeds likewise influence your live two-way communications and are also vital for torrenting. Let's see how NordVPN performs on all three metrics.\n\n\n\nServer location\nLatency (ms)\nIncrease factor\nDownload speed (Mbps)\nPercentage drop\nUpload speed (Mbps)\nPercentage drop\n\n\nUnprotected (Portland, OR, USA)\n22\n--\n59.20\n--\n5.86\n--\n\n\nSeattle, WA, USA (Fastest)\n44\n2x\n57.21\n3.4\n5.62\n4.1\n\n\nNew York, NY, USA\n177\n8x\n56.90\n3.9\n5.60\n4.4\n\n\nStockholm, Sweden\n371\n16.9x\n55.94\n5.5\n5.63\n3.9\n\n\nIstanbul, Turkey\n411\n18.7x\n53.02\n10.4\n5.78\n5.9\n\n\nHong Kong\n350\n15.9x\n56.18\n5.1\n5.72\n2.4\n\n\nJohannesburg, South Africa\n602\n27.4x\n53.26\n10.0\n5.67\n3.3\n\n\nAverage\n326\n14.8x\n55.42\n6.4\n5.54\n4.0\n\n\n\nTo summarize: NordVPN's download speeds are the fastest we've seen and its upload speeds and latency tie with the best. Downloads only dropped by an average of 6.4 percent across the globe and readings were mostly consistent — the servers in question performed much the same in each test. We even threw in Turkey and South Africa, two locations that commonly cause problems, but NordVPN still kept the drop to 10 percent.\n\n\n\n\n   Sam Chapman for Engadget \n \n\nLatency is more a product of physical distance than VPN infrastructure, but you can still see differences between services. When tested on a similar range of locations, ExpressVPN and Proton VPN both kept average latencies under 300 ms. NordVPN's average came out to 326 milliseconds, though we should note that its latency increased less than Proton's on the closest server.\nUpload speeds declined an average of four percent, but there were a few anomalously high readings in Istanbul that skewed those numbers up. Without that location, NordVPN's upload rates would also have been the industry's current best.\nNordVPN security test\nNo matter how well-built a VPN looks from the outside, there are several ways its security can fail. The most common problems are outdated protocols with weak encryption, failing to block IPv6 traffic or inadvertent leaks from sending DNS requests outside the encrypted tunnel. We'll start by looking for those common leak sources, then check whether NordVPN's encryption might be failing in less traceable ways.\nVPN protocols\nA VPN protocol is a set of rules used to get data quickly and safely from your device to a VPN server and back, even while that data is encrypted. Different protocols are connected with different encryption algorithms and can impact the speed, security and stability of your connection.\nWhen testing VPN security, the first step is to see if it's using any protocols like PPTP that are outdated and crackable, or homebrewed protocols with unclear security. NordVPN users have four options for protocols: OpenVPN, IKEv2 (not available on Mac or iOS), NordLynx and NordWhisper (available on Windows, Android and Linux only). \n\n\n\n\n   Sam Chapman for Engadget \n \n\nOpenVPN and IKEv2 are both standard protocols you'll find on most VPN providers. Both use various strengths of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), with OpenVPN defaulting to AES-256 and IKEv2 to AES-128. OpenVPN can be set to UDP (faster but less stable) or TCP (more reliable but slower). So far, so secure.\nNordLynx is unique to NordVPN, but it's not that far off the beaten track — it's just WireGuard with extra security. WireGuard normally works by saving a stable IP address for each connection, which raises the very slight risk of exposing a user. NordLynx adds a second layer of abstraction that means those stable addresses are never revealed. Since NordVPN strongly recommends it for most situations, we used it for all our tests in this review.\nFinally, there's NordWhisper, a new protocol introduced in early 2025 that disguises your VPN traffic as normal web traffic to evade blanket web blocks. It's likely to be slower than the other protocols, so don't use it unless everything else has been blocked. We also don't recommend counting on it too much in general — large-scale censorship technology, like the Great Firewall of China, tends to rely on blocklists of known VPN servers, whose identity NordWhisper can't disguise.\nLeak test\nOur first order of business was to check five test servers to see if they leaked our real IP address — staying away from the ones in the speed test in order to get as comprehensive a picture of NordVPN's security as possible. With help from ipleak.net, we found all five to be free of the three major types of leaks.\n\nDNS leaks occur when a VPN sends DNS requests (in short, how your browser knows which websites to show you) outside its encrypted tunnel. By default, NordVPN uses its own private DNS servers, which our tests showed to effectively prevent leaks.\nWebRTC leaks are caused by real-time communication protocols sending information outside the VPN, which may reveal your real IP address. NordVPN is consistently successful at keeping WebRTC inside the tunnel, but you can have your browser block it if you're still worried.\nIPv6 leaks happen when a VPN only blocks IPv4 traffic and lets v6 through. NordVPN automatically blocks IPv6 traffic while it's active, so an IPv6 leak is all but impossible.\n\n\n\n\n\n   Sam Chapman for Engadget \n \n\nAlthough that's all great news, it is still possible for leaks to occur without a clear explanation, so we ran one final test on NordVPN.\nEncryption test\nWireshark is a program that captures detailed images of information sent over a device's internet connection. Even though our tests showed NordVPN to be free of leaks, we wanted to inspect it at the most granular level. Using WireShark, we recorded the traffic sent to an unencrypted HTTP site, before and after connecting to each NordVPN test server.\nEvery server showed the same pattern: readable plaintext before, encrypted ciphertext after. If there is a security flaw remaining in NordVPN, it's unlikely to be relevant to the overwhelming majority of users.\nHow much does NordVPN cost?\nNordVPN's pricing structure looks convoluted at first, but it's much simpler than it appears. A Basic subscription gets you full VPN functionality, and all the other tiers just add more features. If all you need is a VPN, you only need to concern yourself with the left side of the table below.\nThe best deal for a Basic NordVPN subscription, which lets you connect to NordVPN with up to 10 devices at once, costs $81.36 for two years when you pay upfront ($3.39 per month). One year of the same plan costs $59.88 in advance ($4.99 per month) or $12.99 for one month at a time. The table below shows the complete cost; for more information on plans above Basic, see \"side apps and bundles\" in the next section.\n\n\n\nPlan\n1-month cost\n1-year cost\n2-year cost\n\n\nBasic\n$12.99\n$59.88 ($4.99/month)\n$81.36 ($3.39/month)\n\n\nPlus\n$13.99\n$71.88 ($5.99/month)\n$105.36 ($4.39/month)\n\n\nComplete\n$14.99\n$83.88 ($6.99/month)\n$129.36 ($5.39/month)\n\n\nPrime\n$17.99\n$107.88 ($8.99/month)\n$177.36 ($7.39/month)\n\n\n\nThe longer plans save money, but be careful: if you let them expire, you'll automatically renew at the more expensive one-year plan. Enough customers claim to have been auto-renewed at the higher rate that they've launched a class-action lawsuit against NordVPN, accusing the company of deceptive pricing practices and making renewals too difficult to cancel. A NordVPN PR rep said they could not comment on ongoing legal action, \"other than to state that we are and always have been very clear about the recurring nature of our services.\" No court date has been set so far.\nThat said, there's a fairly straightforward workaround in the meantime: To prevent the auto renewal, log out of your NordVPN account, then sign up for a discounted plan again using the same email. As long as you do this before your subscription expires, your new account should link to your old one, keeping you subscribed at the introductory rate.\nFree trials and refunds\nEvery NordVPN plan comes with a 30-day money-back guarantee. If you cancel and request a refund before 30 days are up, you'll get the full cost back. The only way to try it for free without paying is to get the app on Android, where there's a seven-day trial through the Google Play Store.\nNordVPN side apps and bundles\nNordVPN is part of a larger family of Nord Security products, which you can save money on if you need more than one. We won't review all of them here, but for reference, here's everything you'll get from the higher subscription tiers. \n\nBasic: VPN on 10 devices, specialty servers, DNS ad-blocking, Meshnet\nPlus: All Basic features, plus malware scanning, extra scam blocking, tracker blocking, NordPass password manager, data breach scanner\nComplete: All Plus features, along with 1TB of NordLocker encrypted cloud storage\nPrime: All Complete features, plus NordProtect features like dark web monitoring, credit monitoring, ID theft insurance and extortion insurance\n\nAnother tier called Ultra includes a subscription to Incogni, a data removal service run by Nord's partner Surfshark. The Ultra bundle is only available in certain countries, since NordVPN is still testing it; users outside the test countries can still add Incogni service at checkout. There also used to be a NordVPN family plan, but it seems to have been eliminated after Nord expanded the devices per subscription to 10.\nYou can get a dedicated IP address on NordVPN to ensure you have the same IP every time you connect. This lets you configure remote firewalls to let you through while you're connected to the VPN. A dedicated IP costs $8.99 per month, $70.68 for a year ($5.89 per month) or $100.56 for two years ($4.19 per month).\nThe NordVPN pricing page lists access to a Saily eSIM plan as a perk, though mysteriously, none of the existing plans seem to include it yet. A lot of VPNs are expanding into the eSIM space, so this may change soon.\nClose-reading NordVPN's privacy policy\nA VPN privacy policy isn't just empty words — it's a contract between the provider and its users. If a service openly defied its own policy, it could be sued for false advertising. VPNs tend to sneak loopholes into their privacy policies instead of flouting them outright; these loopholes can shed light on how the provider actually views your privacy.\nWe combed through NordVPN's privacy policy to see whether it tries to take any such liberties. The policy has two parts: the general Nord Security policy and an addendum specific to NordVPN.\nGeneral Nord privacy policy\nThis policy applies to all Nord Security apps. It's impossible to create an account without a valid email address, but you can use a separate email masking service to make that anonymous. The policy also explicitly says that your email address will be added to a marketing mailing list, though you can opt out. Irritating, but not a privacy risk in itself.\nWe're more concerned about the later statement that it may process data without the user's consent \"under the legal basis of our or third parties' legitimate interest.\" This clause covers some cases we'd agree are legitimate, such as identifying people who launch cyberattacks from NordVPN servers. But Nord also considers it \"legitimate interest\" to process your personal data \"to improve or maintain our services and provide new products and features.\"\nReached for comment, a NordVPN representative said that using personal data in this way \"generally involves aggregated, depersonalized or technical information.\" That's somewhat reassuring, but the \"generally\" leaves a bit too much wiggle room. Ideally, we'd prefer that personal data exist wholly in the \"consent only\" section.\nThe section on sharing your data with third parties only lists \"some of\" the service providers who may receive your information. Among these are Google Analytics, which is known to store personal data on U.S. servers — all of which are potential security risks in the age of DOGE. Other unnamed \"third parties\" are involved in targeting ads at users of Nord websites.\nThe NordVPN representative said that \"since some partners, such as payment processors, can vary by region or specific service and may change over time depending on our operational needs, we do not publish a fixed list.\" They added that all third parties are \"contractually required to handle personal data in accordance with applicable laws and industry standards.\"\nWe aren't using this to condemn Nord; many of these practices are fairly standard in the VPN industry. But it's important to know about all the potential leakage points before trusting your deepest secrets to any company.\nNordVPN specific policies\nThe NordVPN privacy policy doesn't add much atop the general Nord notice. It does track session activity connected to your username to make sure you're staying within the 10-device limit, but it automatically deletes these logs 15 minutes after you disconnect. The logs also don't include your IP address or the addresses of VPN servers you used.\n\n\n\n\n   Sam Chapman for Engadget \n \n\nThe only real problem we found is that NordVPN apps collect information about your activity on the app by default. This doesn't include information about your browsing habits, but it does include unique traits that could conceivably be used for \"device fingerprinting\" — in which a third party can deduce a user's identity through clues about their device. You can turn this off in the General settings.\nA NordVPN spokesperson told us that the data collected is \"not personally identifiable,\" and that the company takes \"deliberate steps to strip out anything that could be linked back to a specific person.\" This presumably means the data is aggregated so it only shows general trends, not any one device's activity. That's a lot less risky, but we still recommend switching the setting off.\nThird-party privacy audits\nNordVPN has passed five independent audits of its privacy policy so far, most recently from Deloitte in late 2024. Annoyingly, you can only read the entire report by logging into a Nord account, but it at least doesn't have to be a paid account.\nThe audit found that NordVPN was following its own no-logs policy. Specifically, the Deloitte Lithuania investigators concluded that \"the configuration of IT systems and management of the supporting IT operations is properly prepared, in all material respects in accordance with the NordVPN's description set out in the Appendix I.\" (Appendix I of the report is identical to NordVPN's privacy policy.)\nCan NordVPN change your virtual location?\nYou'll be most interested in this section if you mainly use a VPN to change their location for streaming. To see if NordVPN could unlock new streaming libraries, we picked a new batch of five test servers, then logged onto Netflix. Since Netflix tries to block all VPN servers to prevent copyright issues, our first question was whether we'd get through at all.\nOur second question: would connecting to a NordVPN server actually change what Netflix library we saw? It should, given that NordVPN seems leak-proof, but thoroughness demands we check anyway. Here's what we found.\n\n\n\nServer location\nNetflix unblocked?\nContent changed?\n\n\nCanada\nYes\nYes\n\n\nArgentina\nYes\nYes\n\n\nGermany\nYes\nYes\n\n\nIndia\nYes\nYes\n\n\nNigeria\nYes\nNo\n\n\n\nFour out of five locations worked perfectly. On a Canadian server, we were able to stream Star Trek: The Next Generation, which left American Netflix years ago. The Argentine server gave us access to something called Pasion de Gavilanes, which we'd never heard of but sounds great.\n\n\n\n\n   Sam Chapman for Engadget \n \n\nThe only problem was Nigeria. We tested it several times, connected to multiple different Nigerian locations, but saw our American Netflix library every time. We then ran a leak test on Nigeria, which wasn't one of our security test locations, and found it to be working normally. It's hard to say what happened, especially since the Nigeria server doesn't appear to be virtual, but we can confirm that it wasn't working.\nInvestigating NordVPN's server network\nNordVPN has servers in 153 cities in 117 countries. Out of all total options, 62 are virtual locations (about 40 percent), where the server is really located somewhere else. This makes it possible to get servers into more places, but depending on your actual location relative to the server, it may perform differently than you expect.\n\n\n\n\n   Sam Chapman for Engadget \n \n\nVirtual locations have allowed NordVPN's server network to grow quite extensive, with lots more locations in South America, Africa and Asia than the industry standard. Check out the distribution in the table.\n\n\n\nRegion\nCountries and territories with servers\nTotal server locations\nTotal virtual server locations\n\n\nNorth America\n15\n36\n12\n\n\nSouth America\n10\n10\n6\n\n\nEurope\n48\n57\n11\n\n\nAfrica\n10\n10\n10\n\n\nMiddle East\n7\n7\n4\n\n\nAsia\n24\n26\n18\n\n\nOceania\n3\n7\n1\n\n\nTotal\n117\n153\n62 (40.5 percent)\n\n\n\nThe relatively low proportion of virtual locations (nearly identical to that of ExpressVPN) is a good sign, as it means NordVPN has been growing its server network thoughtfully. Some VPNs — looking at you, HMA — inflate their server lists as a marketing point without seriously considering what it takes to maintain such a large network. That thankfully doesn't seem to be the case here.\nExtra features of NordVPN\nHere's everything you get with a NordVPN app other than the VPN itself. There's a lot going on here, so we'll limit ourselves to a sketch of each feature.\nSpecialty servers\nAs soon as you load NordVPN, you'll see a list of special servers near the top of the right-hand column. We'll go over each of them in order.\n\nDedicated IP: As discussed in the bundles section, a dedicated IP address costs extra. With this, you'll always connect with the same IP, which is private to you alone. It may be worth the price if you find yourself getting asked for CAPTCHAs a lot more while connected to NordVPN — though for what it's worth, that didn't happen to us.\nDouble VPN: This sends your connection through a second VPN server before it reaches your ISP. The second server is your apparent location. There are 10 endpoints to choose from. As you might imagine, your internet will run slower with two VPN servers in the mix, so only use this if you seriously need security.\nObfuscated servers: These are only available on OpenVPN. Obfuscation can help you get around firewalls that seek out and block VPN traffic. If you can't get online with NordVPN when you're on a certain network, obfuscated servers might work.\nOnion Over VPN: After encrypting your data as normal, these servers send it through several nodes of the Tor network, granting you the total anonymity of onion routing while keeping you safe from malicious relays. It's available in two locations, Netherlands and Switzerland, and — like double VPN — is best used only when you need the utmost privacy.\nP2P: NordVPN only allows torrenting on its peer-to-peer servers, but fortunately, it's got P2P servers in 114 countries — only three fewer than it has in total. NordVPN keeps your download and upload speeds very fast on average, so you shouldn't have trouble torrenting from any location.\n\nMeshnet\nMeshnet is NordVPN's most unique and exciting feature by a long shot. By logging into the same NordVPN account on multiple devices, you can connect those devices directly through a NordLynx tunnel without needing a NordVPN server in between.\n\n\n\n\n   Sam Chapman for Engadget \n \n\nEssentially, you're using your own devices as VPN servers — obviously not great for privacy, but amazing for accessing web services in other countries. While two devices are connected, you can transfer files between them through the NordLynx tunnel. You can even invite friends and use their devices.\nThreat Protection\nNordVPN has two levels of antivirus: Threat Protection and Threat Protection Pro. The former is a simple DNS filter that stops your browsing from loading unsafe web pages while NordVPN is active. It's the highest level available on Android, iOS and Linux, or on any Basic subscription.\n\n\n\n\n   Sam Chapman for Engadget \n \n\nThreat Protection Pro, which Plus subscribers or higher can set up on Windows and Mac, can work even when you aren't connected to a NordVPN server. It acts more like a standalone antivirus by scanning downloaded files for malware, and can even block trackers. Basic Threat Protection (without Pro) can block some trackers by filtering out domains known to use them, but doesn't block the trackers directly.\nDark Web Monitor\nWhile active, Dark Web Monitor continually searches known data breach dump sites on the dark web and notifies you if it ever finds your account email address. If you get that notification, change any passwords associated with the address. With a Prime subscription, you can also have it search for your phone number, social security number or other financial information.\nPresets\nPresets let you set up one-click VPN connections with a desired group of settings, a lot like Proton VPN's Profiles. NordVPN comes pre-loaded with presets that optimize for \"Downloads,\" \"Speed\" and \"Browsing,\" which sounds to us like the same thing three times.\nMore usefully, you can create presets for particular countries, then add website shortcuts that will appear once you've connected. You could, for example, set one that connects to a specific location, then add a shortcut to a streaming site available in that location.\nPost-Quantum encryption\nExperts widely believe that quantum computers will eventually make our current encryption algorithms obsolete, but there's almost no consensus on when that will actually happen — except that it hasn't happened yet. Knowing that, NordVPN's \"post-quantum encryption\" feature comes across as a bit premature, but it's reassuring that someone is thinking about it.\nHaving said that, we don't recommend using post-quantum encryption yet. It works by layering one of the known quantum-proof encryption standards on top of a standard NordLynx session, which makes your VPN connection slower and more erratic. Until we can verify a real quantum cyberattack, post-quantum encryption is a needless precaution.\nKill switch\nA kill switch cuts off your internet the instant you lose your connection to a NordVPN server. This protects you in case a server unexpectedly fails, and as a side benefit, prevents you from connecting to any fake VPN servers. You should keep the kill switch on at all times.\nSplit tunneling\nSplit tunneling is available on NordVPN's Windows and Android apps (and Android TV by extension), along with its browser extensions. On Windows and Android, it splits by app: you can determine which apps get online through the VPN and which go unprotected. The browser extensions let you split by URL, so the VPN only protects certain sites.\nNordVPN customer support options\nNordVPN's apps link directly to its online help center. As always, we went in with a specific question in mind: whether the basic level of Threat Protection could block trackers, and if so, what kind. We found the categories on the written support page difficult to parse, especially the troubleshooting section — would the average user appreciate the difference between \"app issues,\" \"connection issues\" and \"errors\"?\nWe correctly guessed that our question would be under \"Using NordVPN -> Features,\" but the introductory article on Threat Protection and Threat Protection Pro was buried at the bottom of the list. Unfortunately, that made things more confusing, as this article says that Threat Protection (not Pro) both does and doesn't block trackers. In NordVPN's favor, however, using the search bar brought us instantly back to that article without any confusion.\nThe live support experience\nUsing NordVPN's live chat was a smooth and reassuring experience. From the time we decided to ask directly, it took us less than a minute to connect with a real person, who quickly cleared up the confusion and promised to update the confusing support page (we'll check back to see if they actually do).\n\n\n\n\n   Sam Chapman for Engadget \n \n\nOne other option is an email support form, which can be found both on the website and in the help sections of NordVPN apps. This is best for complex problems that require screenshots to explain, and promises a response within 24 hours.\nNordVPN background check\nNordVPN was founded in 2012. Launching with its desktop apps, it moved to iOS and Android in 2016, then added apps for browser extensions and smart TVs. Its developer, Nord Security, has no parent company, and its history is relatively uncontroversial. We've documented two notable incidents below, plus more about Nord Security's operations.\nHeadquarters and ownership\nNord Security was founded in Lithuania, and maintains offices there. Although Nord Security is registered in Amsterdam, NordVPN operates under a separate license in Panama, which makes any data requests subject to Panama's courts.\nFinland server breach\nThe first serious incident in NordVPN's history began in March 2018, when unidentified hackers managed to steal three private keys from one of Nord's data centers in Finland. Researchers didn't notice the leak until October 2019, well after the stolen keys had expired, but NordVPN's encryption was still technically vulnerable for several months.\nWe say \"technically,\" because it was really only the outer layer of encryption — and even if they'd broken through it all, the hackers would only have seen browsing activity, not usernames, passwords or anything else sensitive. If anything, NordVPN's response actually makes us trust it more. It ended its relationship with the contractor who ran the Finnish data center and revamped its policies to eliminate the kind of negligence that led to the breach.\nArguably, its only real error was not immediately disclosing the breach. NordVPN learned about the leak and started addressing it in May 2018, but the news didn't break until more than a year later. That timing probably made it look more suspicious than any actual mishandling did.\nLaw enforcement compliance\nAnother minor controversy erupted in 2022, when PCMag and other outlets reported that NordVPN had edited its website to say that it would comply with data requests from law enforcement. NordVPN responded with a new post that said nothing had changed: their policy was always to comply with lawful requests, which — provided the requests were lawfully submitted through a Panamanian court — is literally their only option.\nWe're inclined to agree. VPNs are legal companies. They wouldn't last long if they openly declared their intent to break the law. The key is that when law enforcement comes calling, there shouldn't be anything to show them, as with the Turkish seizure of ExpressVPN. That's why verifiable no-logging policies are so important.\nFinal verdict\nNordVPN is a great service on its own merits. It only suffers from having to be compared with the likes of ExpressVPN and Proton VPN. For example, its P2P servers are good for torrenting, but not as useful without Proton's port forwarding. It's fast, but speed tests fluctuated just a little more than Express.\nNordVPN's extra features are the best reason to pick it over its rivals. With Meshnet, you can theoretically set up a VPN connection anywhere in the world, and no other VPN has anything close to Meshnet's file transfer powers. Threat Protection Pro is also great if you can get it, adding file scanning to bolster the typical approach of just blocking suspicious DNS addresses. Specialty servers round out the offering, with double VPN maintaining good speeds with extra safety and Onion over VPN being among the safest ways to use Tor.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/nordvpn-review-2025-innovative-features-a-few-missteps-163000578.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Proton VPN stands out for two main reasons: it's one of the only virtual private networks (VPNs) to include a free plan with no data limits, and it's one of the few services majority-owned by a nonprofit. It's the best VPN in both of those categories, and it makes a strong case for being the best overall.\nEven if you don't care about the work of the Proton Foundation, Proton VPN is a service worth using. It's easy to install and manage, runs like the wind and meets high standards for security and privacy. It has more IP locations in Africa than any of its competitors. It's even looking toward the future by working toward full IPv6 support. \nIn short, Proton VPN gets our enthusiastic recommendation, especially for torrenting (which it supports on almost every server). It's not perfect — the apps for Apple systems lag behind their Windows and Android counterparts, and the free servers can be noticeably sluggish — but the cons pale in comparison to the pros.

As a rule, it's not difficult. Proton VPN has more features than ExpressVPN, and a couple of them might trip up new users, but you'd have to really scrounge to find an actual inconvenience to complain about.\nWindows\nProton VPN installs easily on Windows — you'll need to grant it permission to make changes, but that's it. Once you've signed in on the app, you'll reach one of the best interfaces we've tried on a VPN. The server network is immediately visible as both a list and map, and the location search bar, connect button and major features are all laid out around the same window.\n\n\n\n   Proton VPN's app for Windows. \n \n\n   Sam Chapman for Engadget \n \n\nIt's honestly amazing how much you can reach from the launch window without anything feeling cluttered. They even squeezed in keyboard shortcuts for the search field. We also love that settings open in the same window, since dealing with both the main VPN app and a separate preferences panel can get annoying. Our only real gripe is that there should be an easier way to adjust the size of the map.\nMac\nThe desktop app for Mac isn't quite as deftly laid out as the Windows app. You can reach most of the important features from the main window, including Profiles, NetShield, Secure Core servers and the kill switch. However, there's no longer a way to filter out a list of the P2P or Tor servers, except by digging through the Profile controls. On the plus side, you can adjust the size of the map, so it's now a viable alternative to the server list.\n\n\n\n   Proton VPN's dark mode interface on macOS. \n \n\n   Sam Chapman for Engadget \n \n\nThe other preferences are hidden in the menu bar — go to Proton VPN > Settings to reach them. They're laid out in four tabs, and shouldn't take more than a minute to go through at setup.\nAndroid\nThe Android app takes the same design cues as the Windows app, and works as well. Four tabs along the bottom switch between the home screen, the country list, Profiles and all other settings. You can search the list of countries by tapping the magnifying glass at the top-right. In another nice touch, tapping the dots by any virtual location will tell you where the server is physically located.\n\n\n\n   Proton VPN's Android client. \n \n\n   Sam Chapman for Engadget \n \n\nAndroid users get some nifty exclusive Profiles, including \"anti-censorship,\" which automatically connects to the fastest country except for the one you're in. The Settings tab is a single menu with subheadings and no unnecessary complication.\niOS\nProton VPN for iPhone and iPad looks almost the same as it does on Windows and Android, but with some of the same drawbacks found on Mac. The server list is more cluttered, and once again there's no easy way to sift out the P2P and Tor locations.\n\n\n\n   Proton VPN's app for iPhone and iPad. \n \n\n   Sam Chapman for Engadget \n \n\nThe Settings tab puts all the feature descriptions in the open, which makes it look denser than it is. But these are minor quibbles — this is still a VPN that's very easy to activate and forget about.\nBrowser extensions\nProton VPN has browser extensions for Chrome and Firefox. These serve as de facto split tunneling, as connecting through the extension protects only browser traffic; everything else goes unprotected. You can split the tunnel further by setting the VPN to not work on certain URLs (unlike the other apps, you don't need to know the IPs of those sites).\nProton VPN speed test: Impacts of VPN Accelerator\nWe used Ookla's Speedtest app to determine how much Proton VPN drags on a user's latency, measured in milliseconds (ms), and download and upload speeds, measured in megabits per second (Mbps). Together, these three stats show whether a VPN will noticeably slow down your internet, especially during demanding tasks.\nWe had high hopes for Proton here because of its VPN Accelerator technology, which runs VPN communications across several parallel tracks to process everything faster. It didn't disappoint — for the most part. Although download speeds didn't reach the heights we saw from ExpressVPN, Proton VPN's browsing performance still looks excellent nearly across the board.\n\n\n\n   Proton VPN barely makes a dent in your download speeds. \n \n\n   Sam Chapman for Engadget \n \n\nTo choose our locations for the test, we checked Proton VPN's list of smart routing servers, which use servers in one country to simulate IP addresses in another. Almost all the smart routing servers are based in five cities: Miami, London, Marseille, Bucharest and Singapore. We ran these tests on a Mac using the automatic protocol setting.\n\n\n\nServer Location\nLatency (ms)\nIncrease factor\nDownload speed (Mbps)\nPercentage drop\nUpload speed (Mbps)\nPercentage drop\n\n\nPortland, OR, USA (unprotected)\n16\n--\n58.93\n--\n5.82\n--\n\n\nSan Jose, CA, USA (best server)\n52\n3.3x\n55.82\n5\n5.58\n4\n\n\nMiami, FL, USA\n160\n10x\n54.33\n8\n5.49\n6\n\n\nLondon, UK\n332\n20.8x\n52.55\n11\n5.72\n2\n\n\nMarseille, France\n309\n19.3x\n45.42\n23\n5.59\n4\n\n\nBucharest, Romania\n408\n25.5x\n52.51\n11\n5.57\n4\n\n\nSingapore, Singapore\n394\n24.6x\n52.26\n11\n5.50\n5\n\n\nAverage\n276\n17.3x\n52.15\n12\n5.58\n4\n\n\n\nProton VPN looks very good in that table. Its average download speed was 88 percent of our unprotected speeds. To put that in perspective, if you started with 30 Mbps down (about half what we get) and connected to any Proton VPN server, you'd almost certainly still have a fast enough connection to stream in 4K.\nNote the \"almost\" — Proton VPN did drop noticeably on its French server in Marseille. It's not uncommon for one of a VPN's data centers to have trouble while the others work fine, and you can usually fix the problem by just disconnecting and reconnecting. Just note that while drops to about 75 percent of your download speed are rare, they're not inconceivable.\nProton VPN security test: Watertight protocols\nWhen we talk about VPN security, we're really talking about reliability. Can this VPN establish an encrypted tunnel and transmit all your information through it, every time, without leaks or failures? With Proton VPN, we're happy to say the answer is yes; we probed its security and found no cracks to speak of. Read the section below for specifics.\nProton VPN protocols: WireGuard, OpenVPN, IKEv2 and Stealth\nProton VPN uses four VPN protocols to communicate between your devices, its servers and the internet. Three of them (WireGuard, OpenVPN and IKEv2) are common choices with no serious flaws as long as they're implemented thoughtfully. The fourth, Stealth, is an obfuscation protocol you should only use if the other three are blocked.\n\n\n\n   The protocol selection screen on Proton VPN's Android app. \n \n\n   Sam Chapman for Engadget \n \n\n\nOpenVPN is the most secure option. Without getting too technical, OpenVPN encrypts its backend functions as well as the data itself, which leaves it with no obvious vulnerabilities. It can also communicate using the same ports as common HTTPS traffic, so it's hard to block.\nWireGuard is more efficient than OpenVPN, both in its source code and the cryptography it uses. It normally requires an exchange of fixed IP addresses, but the Proton VPN implementation overwrites those IPs with randomized addresses, cutting the security risk.\nIKEv2 is a safe choice that's occasionally faster than either OpenVPN or WireGuard. You probably won't use it unless it happens to come up while you've set the protocol to Smart. As such, it's on the way to being phased out of Proton VPN.\nStealth is unique to Proton VPN, though its function is not. It's got the same architecture as WireGuard, but adds another TLS tunnel to evade network blocks that catch VPN traffic. That extra encryption slows it down, so we don't recommend using it unless the other three protocols don't work.\n\nThe first option on the app, called \"Smart,\" is not a protocol — it means your VPN client selects the protocol that will give you the best speeds on your current server. Since all four protocols are safe, there's no downside to using the Smart setting most of the time.\nLeak test\nWe used AirVPN's IP leak tool to check all four of Proton VPN's protocols for DNS and WebRTC leaks. Proton VPN uses its own DNS servers to reduce the risk of sending unencrypted requests, but since leaks are still possible, we tested using a simple method: checking our visible IP address before and after connecting to the VPN.\nDespite testing several locations over three days, we never saw our real IP address show up on the tool. This held true even outside the Secure Core server list, where data centers might have been managed by third parties. It's not perfect proof, but it's a very good sign that Proton VPN enforces a consistent security regime on all its servers.\n\n\n\n   Proton VPN successfully masked our real IP address, even on a virtual location in Angola. \n \n\n   Sam Chapman for Engadget \n \n\nWe also used BrowserLeaks to check for WebRTC leaks. These are mainly an issue on the browser side, but a VPN is doubly important if your browser happens to be leaking. We enabled WebRTC on our browser and tested the same set of Proton VPN servers without springing any WebRTC leaks.\nProton VPN and IPv6\nProton is working on making its entire VPN compatible with IPv6 addresses. If a VPN that's only configured for IPv4 has to resolve an IPv6 address, it can cause a leak — that's why most VPNs, even the best ones, block IPv6 altogether. That said, the whole internet will run on IPv6 one day, so it's nice to see Proton VPN leading the pack.\nSo far, IPv6 is automatically enabled on Proton VPN's Linux apps and browser extensions, and can be optionally activated on its Android app. The Proton VPN apps for all other platforms still block IPv6 traffic, but this should hopefully change soon.\nEncryption test\nEven if a VPN's protocol choices are solid, it's possible for individual implementations of those protocols to fail. We used WireShark, a packet inspector app, to test whether Proton VPN's encryption worked no matter what settings were in place. We're happy to say we never saw plaintext once.\nHow much does Proton VPN cost?\nTo get full access to Proton VPN, you'll need a Plus subscription, which costs $9.99 per month. You can knock off half that price by subscribing for a full year and paying a lump sum of $59.88, working out to $4.99 per month. A Plus account with Proton VPN also gives you free access to every other Proton app.\nYou can also pay $107.76 in advance to subscribe for two years, an average of $4.49 per month — perhaps more convenient, but it doesn't save you much. The one-year plan is the best value, though it's also nice that you don't have to pay through the nose for only one month. There's a 30-day, money-back guarantee on all plans.\nProton VPN is currently offering Engadget readers an exclusive deal that offers a 12-month plan for $47.88 ($3.99 per month) and a 24-month plan for $81.36 ($3.39 per month). Learn more about it here. One final option is the Proton Unlimited subscription, discussed in the \"side apps and bundles\" section below.\"\nThe Proton VPN free plan\nProton VPN is one of the best free VPNs on the market right now. No other VPN backed by as much experience and good judgment has a free plan with no data limits. Instead of capping how much data you can use per month, Proton VPN restricts which servers free users can access, limiting them to five countries: the United States, Japan, the Netherlands, Poland and Romania.\nThe frustrating part is that you can't choose which of these servers you use; Proton VPN just auto-connects to whichever one is the least burdened. A Proton representative told us that this change goes along with improvements to the selection algorithm, better load balancing and the addition of the Poland and Romania locations. It is also possible to try for a better connection by clicking \"change server.\"\nThe fact remains, though, that a free Proton VPN plan is useless for unblocking content in specific locations — but this may be by design. The free plan seems more aimed toward privacy and anonymity than streaming, and the placement of the free locations near Russia and China reflects that. Free Proton VPN plans don't sacrifice any essential security features.\nProton VPN side apps and bundles\nProton VPN's main bundle is Proton Unlimited, which gets you all six Proton products in one package: VPN, Mail, Drive, Calendar, Wallet and Pass. This costs $12.99 for a month, $119.88 for a year ($9.99 per month) and $191.76 for two years ($7.99 per month). We won't be going in-depth on any of them in this review, but here's a quick rundown of each.\n\nProton Mail: An end-to-end encrypted email service. Proton can still see a Mail user's real IP address, but can't read any of their messages.\nProton Drive: Encrypted cloud storage. As with Mail, Proton can identify users, but can't read any of the content they store.\nProton Calendar: An encrypted scheduling app with events and reminders.\nProton Wallet: A self-custody wallet for storing Bitcoin unconnected to any exchange.\nProton Pass: A password manager that generates, stores and autofills passwords for online accounts.\n\nEven if you only need two of the six, Proton Unlimited saves you money. Separate monthly subscriptions to Proton VPN and Proton Mail would cost a total of $14.98, so you've already knocked off $2 per month. That increases if you're able to commit to a year in advance.\nClose-reading Proton VPN's privacy policy\nProton's privacy policy comes in two parts: the general Proton policy and the shorter policy specific to Proton VPN. We'll cover them in that order.\nGeneral Proton privacy policy\nProton tracks user activity on its product websites using its own marketing tools; the data set collected does not include IP addresses. It retains an email address connected to each user's account, but it's not allowed to connect IP addresses (and thus identities and locations) to those emails unless the user breaches the terms of service.\nYou may rightly ask how Proton would know a user is abusing one of their services if they don't keep activity logs. The answer is that logs aren't needed; most forms of abuse can be detected in other ways and observed in real time. For example, if someone used a Proton VPN server to launch a DDoS attack, the team could inspect that server and find the hacker while the attack was still ongoing.\nThe policy goes on to list the five third-party data processors Proton uses (Zendesk, PayPal, Chargebee, Atlassian and Stripe), none of whom are allowed to store customer activity data. Proton cautions that it will share what data it does have in response to unblockable requests from the Swiss government, but not \"until all legal or other remedies have been exhausted.\" This is standard for a VPN that wants to remain in business, and the transparency report shows the company does indeed fight court orders when it can.\nProton VPN privacy policy\nProton's VPN-specific privacy policy is quite short. It states that Proton cannot log user activities or identifiable characteristics of devices connected to the VPN, cannot throttle internet connections and must extend full privacy and security to free users.\nIn one sense, a privacy policy requires you to take the VPN provider at their word, but it's dangerous for a company to make promises they don't intend to keep. The policy is legally binding, and breaking it is grounds for a lawsuit. Proton VPN's succinct no-logs policy is therefore a great sign. It's also been confirmed several times by a third-party audit, most recently in July 2024.\nCan Proton VPN change your virtual location?\nTesting a VPN's ability to mask a user's location isn't complex — all you need is a streaming subscription. We connected to five test locations and tried to unblock Netflix with each one. If we managed to access the site, and saw different shows than those on the American library, we concluded that the location had masked us successfully.\n\n\n\nServer location\nUnblocked Netflix?\nLibrary changed?\n\n\nCanada\nY\nY\n\n\nRomania\nY\nY\n\n\nGhana\nY\nY\n\n\nJapan\nY\nY\n\n\nNew Zealand\nY\nY\n\n\n\nProton VPN passed the test every time in all five locations. The only hiccup came in Romania, which we chose because it's one of the free locations. The app connected us to a free server, which was too slow to load Netflix; when we chose a paid server, the problem disappeared.\n\n\n\n   Proton VPN changed our virtual location so we saw the Japanese Netflix library. \n \n\n   Sam Chapman for Engadget \n \n\nInvestigating Proton VPN's server network\nProton VPN's free plan includes servers in five locations: the Netherlands, Poland, Romania, the United States and Japan. When you connect as a free user, you'll be automatically connected to whichever location is fastest.\nA paid plan opens up the full network of 154 servers in 117 countries and territories. The menu includes a huge selection of African locations, more than any VPN we've tested in some time. The Middle East, along with central and southern Asia, are also well represented, and U.S. users will find 20 different locations to choose from.\n\n\n\n   Proton VPN lets you know which of its locations are virtual. \n \n\n   Sam Chapman for Engadget \n \n\nKeep in mind that about two-thirds of these server locations are virtual, meaning they're not physically located where they claim to be. This includes all the African servers except South Africa and Nigeria; all the South American servers except Brazil, Colombia and Argentina; and all the Middle Eastern servers except Turkey, Israel and the UAE. A majority of the locations in Asia are also virtual, including South Korea, India, Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines.\nTo be clear, virtual locations can hide your IP address just as well as physical ones. It's only a problem if you're expecting the kind of performance, particularly in terms of latency, that you get from a nearby server. Luckily, Proton VPN gives you fast enough download and upload speeds that distance shouldn't be a problem.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       None \n     \n\n\nCountries\nVirtual Locations\nCities\n\n\nNorth America\n6\n3\n25\n\n\nSouth America\n7\n4\n7\n\n\nEurope\n42\n6\n51\n\n\nAfrica\n25\n23\n26\n\n\nMiddle East\n13\n10\n14\n\n\nAsia\n22\n16\n25\n\n\nOceania\n2\n0\n6\n\n\nTOTAL\n117\n62\n154\n\n\n\nFeatures of Proton VPN\nProton VPN has a number of extra features that go beyond standard VPN functionality. We've already mentioned the Stealth protocol and IPv6 support. In this section, we'll cover an additional five features that might be of interest.\nNetShield ad blocker\nProton VPN's built-in ad blocker is known as NetShield. It's available on the main UI page, and has two settings: one that blocks only malware sites, and one that blocks sites connected with malware, ads and trackers. The stronger feature is on by default.\n\n\n\n   The Netshield page on Proton VPN's iOS app. \n \n\n   Sam Chapman for Engadget \n \n\nNetShield works by checking any DNS requests against a database of web servers known to host malware, inject ads or attach cross-site trackers to your browsing session. The DNS-blocking approach means it's not capable of blocking ads served from the same domain that hosts them — so no blocking YouTube video ads. On the positive side, it means NetShield works across your entire device, not just on your browser.\nNetShield also displays a running total of how many of each form of interference it's blocked. It catches most banner ads, but since you can't customize the blocklist in any way, it's best when combined with another browser-level ad blocker.\nSecure Core servers\nHere's an interesting one. Secure Core is a form of a common feature known as double VPN or multi-hop VPN, in which a connection runs through two VPN servers before being decrypted. If one server fails or gets compromised, the other server keeps your connection private.\n\n\n\n   Secure Core servers add a second node to your VPN connection. \n \n\n   Sam Chapman for Engadget \n \n\nProton VPN takes this a step further. When you activate Secure Core, your connection will still end at your chosen server location — but before that, it will travel through a designated server in Iceland, Sweden or Switzerland. A few touches make Secure Core servers more reliable than the average VPN node:\n\nAll three countries are safe jurisdictions, with consumer-friendly privacy laws and courts sympathetic to privacy claims.\nSecure Core data centers are locked down physically; for example, the Iceland location is a refitted military base, and the Sweden location is literally underground.\nProton owns and operates all Secure Core locations itself, with no rentals or third-party managers.\n\nAlmost no other VPNs pay as much attention to physical security as Proton VPN does with this feature. The second hop makes Secure Core connections slower on average, but it's worth it if you have something especially sensitive to do online.\nKill switch\nProton VPN includes a kill switch, a standard feature. When active, a kill switch cuts off your internet whenever your connection to the VPN drops. This means you're never in danger of leaking your real identity or location, even for a second. It also protects you against the TunnelVision exploit, which requires the hacker to make a fake VPN server.\nSplit tunneling\nSplit tunneling is included on the Windows and Android apps, but users on other devices can access it through the browser extension. With split tunneling, some apps or websites get online through the VPN, while others stay unprotected.\n\n\n\n   Split tunneling with Proton VPN on Android. \n \n\n   Sam Chapman for Engadget \n \n\nProton VPN allows split tunneling by both app and IP address. This grants you a precise level of control over your split, as long as you know the IP of each website you're placing on the list (you can find that out using DNS checker).\nTorrenting servers and port forwarding\nProton VPN is one of the best VPNs for torrenting. It restricts torrenting to P2P servers, but nearly every server on the list is a P2P server — only Secure Core servers and some free servers don't permit torrenting. Combine that with the fact that it maintains 96 percent of your upload speeds on average, and you should have few problems using a torrenting client.\n\n\n\n   Proton VPN's list of P2P servers. \n \n\n   Sam Chapman for Engadget \n \n\nIt also has some support for port forwarding, which can improve torrenting speed. Windows and Linux users can enable it with a simple toggle, which provides an active port number for configuring private servers. Mac users can set up port forwarding through manual OpenVPN or WireGuard configurations.\nTor over VPN\nA handful of Proton VPN servers route you directly to the Tor network after encrypting your connection. While connected to one of these Tor over VPN servers, which are marked with TOR in their names and an onion symbol, you'll be able to open .onion links on a normal browser.\nThis is more than just convenient — Tor over VPN is the safest way to access the dark web. With the VPN as an intermediary, you're never connecting to Tor with your own IP address, so malicious node operators can't see your real identity. For maximum privacy, use Tor Browser to create your Proton VPN account, so you're never exposed at any point in the process.\nProton VPN has Tor servers in six countries (the U.S., France, Switzerland, Sweden, Germany and Hong Kong). Each just has one Tor server, except the United States, which gets two. Tor over VPN is supported on all platforms, but it won't work on Mac or iOS unless you have the kill switch enabled.\nProfiles\nA \"profile\" on Proton VPN is a group of pre-established settings you can use to quickly configure the VPN for a particular task. Two profiles are available from the start: Fastest, which connects to the fastest server, and Random, which always connects to a different server. You can create more profiles by toggling four settings:\n\nFeature: The type of server used. Choose from Standard, Secure Core, P2P or Tor over VPN.\nCountry: The country to which the profile connects.\nServer: A server within that country. You can also select \"fastest\" or \"random.\"\nProtocol: Which VPN protocol the profile will use. \"Smart\" can be selected.\n\nAs an example, say you want to watch a TV series that's only available on Netflix in Canada. You could create a profile called \"Netflix Canada\" that connects to the fastest Canadian server with just one click. We'd call profiles situationally useful, but they can save a lot of time if you regularly perform the same action on your VPN.\nProton VPN customer support options\nWe went to Proton VPN's FAQ pages with two questions that came up while researching other sections: which of Proton VPN's servers are managed by third parties, and why do certain server locations (like Marseilles) run slow despite the app showing a light load?\nYou can access the help center through any of Proton VPN's apps, or by going directly to the website. Articles appear to be organized into six categories. Oddly, clicking any category button only shows you a handful of the articles in that section — for example, the Troubleshooting category looks like it only has five articles. If you type \"troubleshooting\" into the search bar, though, you'll see dozens pop up. There are even some sections, like Billing, that don't appear on the main page at all.\nIt has the feel of a website update that wasn't adequately brought in line with the bulk of the support content. Until Proton fixes it, just use the search bar for everything. The articles themselves are well-written, give or take some stilted English.\nGetting quick help\nWe couldn't find written answers to our questions about ownership and server load, so we turned to live chat. Free users should keep in mind that live chat support is only available on paid accounts, but there's a fairly active subreddit at r/protonvpn where Proton staff frequently post.\nLive chat is not intuitively located on protonvpn.com. We finally found it by scrolling all the way to the bottom of the main page, only to be told nobody was online to help at the moment — live chat is only accessible from 9 AM to midnight Central European Time (CET). We submitted our question about the Marseille servers as an email ticket instead.\n\n\n\n\n   Sam Chapman for Engadget \n \n\nThis part was easy, at least, as the form helpfully populated our system information. We also got a prompt response within 24 hours. We ended the interaction there, as we weren't able to reproduce the sluggish behavior on the French server locations, but it's nice to know the team will answer quickly.\nProton VPN background check: The CERN origins of Proton AG\nProton VPN launched in 2017, but its team's experience goes back much farther. The founders of its parent company, Proton AG, met while working at CERN in Switzerland, and the company remains under Swiss jurisdiction.\nTheir first product, Proton Mail, went live in 2014 after a successful crowdfunding campaign, and claims to have 100 million users today. Proton VPN was Proton AG's second project. Like Proton Mail, it consists of a free plan supplemented by paid upgrades.\nSince then, Proton has introduced several more products: Proton Calendar in 2020, Proton Drive cloud storage in 2022 and the Proton Pass password manager in 2023, each designed around using end-to-end encryption to make user data inaccessible.\nThe Proton Foundation\nProton announced in 2024 that the majority of its shares had been acquired by the Proton Foundation, a nonprofit whose only purpose is to control Proton stock. Among other benefits, this prevents it from being purchased by anyone who disagrees with its mission. To sell to an objectionable parent company, the entire board of trustees would have to agree, which feels unlikely based on Proton's track record.\nThroughout Proton's history, we only found two incidents serious enough to comment on, and only one of them concerned Proton VPN. We'll cover them both below.\nProtonMail law enforcement collaboration allegations\nOn the page that hosts its annual transparency report, Proton states openly that it \"may be legally compelled to disclose certain user information to Swiss authorities\" (see the Privacy Policy section of this article for more on precisely what information that describes). In 2021, the company admitted it had given Swiss police (acting on a French warrant) a ProtonMail user's IP address and device logs. The police arrested the user, a French environmental activist.\nWhile that's unnerving for privacy-minded users, there are some important contextual issues to consider. Most importantly, ProtonMail is not governed by the same policy as Proton VPN. At the time the case unfolded, Swiss law obliged all email companies to comply with court orders from Swiss authorities to hand over data. VPNs aren't subject to those retention requirements.\nToday, Swiss email companies have been reclassified so they're also exempt from data retention requirements, thanks in part to a policy change Proton fought for. A representative from Proton confirmed that \"under Swiss law, we are not obligated to save any user connection logs.\" It's also reassuring that, despite complying with the subpoena, Proton wasn't able to turn over the contents of any emails.\nAlleged WireGuard memory vulnerability\nIn January 2025, researchers at Venak Security alleged that Proton VPN lacks memory protection for keys generated under the WireGuard protocol, which might let hackers scrape the keys and decrypt intercepted communications. Proton responded to Venak in a blog post, which a Proton representative confirmed remains their official response to the allegations.\nIn short: the Venak article only demonstrates that it's possible to view public keys, not private ones. This isn't much of a bombshell, given that \"public\" is right there in the name. But asymmetric encryption — the kind used by VPN protocols like WireGuard — requires both keys to decrypt any messages. Even if a hacker were able to get ahold of a private key, they likely wouldn't be able to use it for anything. WireGuard incorporates perfect forward secrecy by default, changing session keys often enough that any given key is obsolete by the time it's stolen.\nFinal verdict\nIn short, we're prepared to recommend Proton VPN to almost anybody. Whether you're mainly concerned with security, streaming or something else, chances are good that you'll be satisfied. The only serious downsides are that the long-term plans are overpriced and that it's hard to get live tech support if you live outside of Europe.\nIt's also our unqualified pick for the best free VPN, but with the caveat that it's a bad choice for anyone who needs to choose specific server locations. If all you care about is staying hidden from your ISP and advertisers, Proton should be your first choice.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/proton-vpn-review-2025-a-nonprofit-service-with-premium-performance-153046073.html?src=rss",

They're laid out in four tabs, and shouldn't take more than a minute to go through at setup. It's got the same architecture as WireGuard, but adds another TLS tunnel to evade network blocks that catch VPN traffic. This held true even outside the Secure Core server list, where data centers might have been managed by third parties. You may rightly ask how Proton would know a user is abusing one of their services if they don't keep activity logs. Windows and Linux users can enable it with a simple toggle, which provides an active port number for configuring private servers. You could create a profile called \"Netflix Canada\" that connects to the fastest Canadian server with just one click. We'd call profiles situationally useful, but they can save a lot of time if you regularly perform the same action on your VPN. Free users should keep in mind that live chat support is only available on paid accounts, but there's a fairly active subreddit at r/protonvpn where Proton staff frequently post.

    "summary": "ExpressVPN is good at its job. It's easy to be skeptical of any service with a knack for self-promotion, but don't let ExpressVPN's hype distract you from the fact that it keeps its front-page promise of \"just working.\"\nOutside of solid security, the two best things ExpressVPN offers are fast speeds and a simple interface. Our tests showed only a 7% average drop in download speed and a 2% loss of upload speed, worldwide. And while the lack of extra features may frustrate experienced users, it makes for a true set-and-forget VPN on any platform. \nThis isn't to say ExpressVPN is without flaws — it's nearly bereft of customization options and it's notably more expensive than its competition — but it beats most VPNs in a head-to-head matchup.\nFor this review, we followed our rigorous 10-step VPN testing process, exploring ExpressVPN's security, privacy, speed, interfaces and more. Whether you read straight through or skip to the sections that are most important for you, you should come away with all the information you need to decide whether to subscribe.\nEditor's note (7/25/25): We're in the process of revamping our VPN coverage to provide more in-depth, actionable information and buying guides. Our recommendations, and all the info on this page, are subject to change as the update continues.

The first step for any setup process is to make an account on expressvpn.com and buy a subscription.\nWindows\nOnce subscribed, download the Windows VPN from either expressvpn.com or the Microsoft Store, then open the .exe file. Click \"Yes\" to let it make changes, wait for the install, then let your computer reboot. Including the reboot, the whole process takes 5-10 minutes, most of it idle. To finish, you'll need your activation code, which you can find by going to expressvpn.com and clicking \"Setup\" in the top-right corner.\n\n\n\n   You can install ExpressVPN's Windows app from the Microsoft store, but we found the website more convenient. \n \n\n   Sam Chapman for Engadget \n \n\nExtreme simplicity is the watchword for all ExpressVPN's designs. The Windows client's launch panel consists of three buttons and less than ten words. You can change your location or let the app pick a location for you — the \"Smart Location\" is the server with the best combination of being nearby and unburdened.\nEverything else is crammed into the hamburger menu at the top left. Here, in seven tabs, you'll find the Network Lock kill switch, the four types of content blockers, the split tunneling menu and the option to change your VPN protocol. You can also add shortcuts to various websites, useful if you regularly use your VPN for the same online destinations.\nTo sum up, there's almost nothing here to get in the way: no delays, no snags, no nested menus to get lost in. It may be the world's most ignorable VPN client. That's not a bad thing at all.\nMac\nExpressVPN's app for macOS is almost identical in design to its Windows app. The process for downloading and setting it up is nearly the same too. As on Windows, it can be downloaded from the App Store or sideloaded directly from the expressvpn.com download center. Only a few features are missing and a couple others have been added. Split tunneling is gone (unless you're still on a macOS lower than 11), and you won't see the Lightway Turbo setting.\n\n\n\n   ExpressVPN recommends some servers, but it's easy to search the whole list. \n \n\n   Sam Chapman for Engadget \n \n\n\nMac users do gain access to the IKEv2 protocol, along with the option to turn off automatic IPv6 blocking — Windows users have to leave it blocked at all times. Almost every website is still accessible via IPv4, but it's useful if you do need to access a specific IPv6 address while the VPN is active.\nAndroid\nAndroid users can download ExpressVPN through the Google Play Store. Open the app, sign in and you're ready to go. The Android app has a very nice dark-colored design, only slightly marred by an unnecessary information box about how long you've used the VPN this week.\n\n\n\n   ExpressVPN's Android app puts a little more information on the screen than it needs to, but still runs well. \n \n\n   Sam Chapman for Engadget \n \n\nThere's a large button for connecting. Clicking on the server name takes you to a list of locations. On this list, you can either search or scroll and can choose individual locations within a country that has more than one. We connected to as many far-flung server locations as we could, but not a single one took longer than a few seconds.\nThe options menu is organized sensibly, with no option located more than two clicks deep. You will see a couple of options here that aren't available on desktop, the best of which is the ability to automatically connect to your last-used ExpressVPN server whenever your phone connects to a non-trusted wifi network.\nThere are also a few general security tools: an IP address checker, DNS and WebRTC leak testers and a password generator. These are also available on the website, but here, they're built into the app. With the exception of the latter, we'd recommend using third-party testing tools instead — even a VPN with integrity has an incentive to make its own app look like it's working.\niPhone and iPad\nYou can only install ExpressVPN's iOS app through the app store. During setup, you may need to enter your password to allow your phone to use VPN configurations. Otherwise, there are no major differences from the Android process.\n\n\n\n   ExpressVPN looks good on iPhone and iPad. \n \n\n   Sam Chapman for Engadget \n \n\nThe interface is not quite as pleasing as the dark-mode Android app, but it makes up for that by cutting out some of the clutter. The tabs and features are similar, though split tunneling and shortcuts are absent. Also, both mobile apps make customer support a lot more accessible than their desktop counterparts — plus, mobile is the only way to send email support tickets.\nBrowser extension\nExpressVPN also includes browser extensions for Firefox and Chrome. These let you connect, disconnect and change server locations without leaving your browser window. It's nice, but not essential unless you have a very specific web browser flow you like.\nExpressVPN speed test: Very fast averages\nConnecting to a VPN almost always decreases your speed, but the best VPNs mitigate the drop as much as possible. We used Ookla's speed testing app to see how much of your internet speed ExpressVPN preserves. For this test, we emphasized the locations ExpressVPN uses for most of its virtual servers, including the Netherlands, Brazil, Germany and Singapore.\nSome terms before we start:\n\nLatency, measured in milliseconds (ms), is the time it takes one data packet to travel between your device and a web server through the VPN. Latency increases with distance. It's most important for real-time tasks like video chatting and online gaming.\nDownload speed, measured in megabits per second (Mbps), is the amount of information that can download onto your device at one time — such as when loading a web page or streaming a video.\nUpload speed, also measured in Mbps, is the amount of information your device can send to the web at once. It's most important for torrenting, since the amount of data you can seed determines how fast you can download in exchange.\n\nThe table below shows our results. We conducted this on Windows, using the automatic protocol setting with the Lightway Turbo feature active — a recent ExpressVPN addition that keeps speed more consistent by processing connections in parallel.\n\n\n\nServer location\nLatency (ms)\nIncrease factor\nDownload speed (Mbps)\nPercentage dropoff\nUpload speed (Mbps)\nPercentage dropoff\n\n\nPortland, Oregon, USA (unprotected)\n18\n--\n58.77\n--\n5.70\n--\n\n\nSeattle, Washington, USA (best server)\n26\n1.4x\n54.86\n6.7%\n5.52\n3.2%\n\n\nNew York, NY, USA\n156\n8.7x\n57.25\n2.6%\n5.57\n2.3%\n\n\nAmsterdam, Netherlands\n306\n17x\n53.83\n8.4%\n5.58\n2.1%\n\n\nSão Paulo, Brazil\n371\n20.6x\n53.82\n8.4%\n5.65\n0.9%\n\n\nFrankfurt, Germany\n404\n22.4x\n55.71\n5.2%\n5.67\n0.5%\n\n\nSingapore, Singapore\n381\n21.2x\n52.76\n10.2%\n5.64\n1.0%\n\n\nAverage\n274\n15.2x\n54.71\n6.9%\n5.61\n1.6%\n\n\n\nThese are extremely good results. ExpressVPN is a winner on both download and upload speed. No matter where we went in the world, we never lost more than about 7% of our download speeds, and upload lost an astoundingly low average of 2%. This suggests that ExpressVPN deftly distributes its user load between servers to eliminate bottlenecks.\n\n\n\n   This Ookla speedtest shows you can still get fast internet while connected to ExpressVPN -- our unprotected speeds are around 58 Mbps. \n \n\n   Sam Chapman for Engadget \n \n\nThe latency numbers look worse, but the rise in the table is less sharp than we projected. Ping length depends far more on distance than download speed does, so we expect it to shoot up on servers more than 1,000 miles from our location. Keeping the average below 300 ms, as ExpressVPN does here, is a strong showing.\nExpressVPN security test: Checking for leaks\nA VPN's core mission is to hide your IP address and make you untraceable online. Our task in this section is to figure out if ExpressVPN can carry out this mission every time you connect. While we can't be 100% certain, the tests we'll run through below have led us to believe that ExpressVPN is currently leak-proof.\nAvailable VPN protocols\nA VPN protocol is like a common language that a VPN server can use to mediate between your devices and the web servers you visit. If a VPN uses outdated or insecure protocols, or relies on unique protocols with no visible specs or source code, that's a bad sign.\n\n\n\n   Not all protocols are available on all apps, but Mac has the full range. \n \n\n   Sam Chapman for Engadget \n \n\nExpressVPN gives you a selection of three protocols: IKEv2, OpenVPN and Lightway. The first two are solid choices that support the latest encryption algorithms. OpenVPN has been fully open-source for years and is the best choice if privacy is your goal. While IKEv2 started life as a closed project by Microsoft and Cisco, ExpressVPN uses an open-source reverse-engineering, which is both better for privacy and quite fast.\nLightway is the odd one out, a protocol you'll only find on ExpressVPN, though its source code is available on Github. It's similar to WireGuard, in that both reach for faster speeds and lower processing demands by keeping their codebases slim. However, Lightway was recently rewritten in Rust to better protect the keys stored in its memory.\nUltimately, you can't go wrong with any of ExpressVPN's protocol options. 99% of the time, your best choice will be to set the controls to Automatic and let the VPN decide which runs best.\nTesting for leaks\nExpressVPN is one of the best services, but it's not leak-proof (as you can read in the Background Check below). Luckily, checking for DNS leaks is a simple matter of checking your IP address before and after connecting to a VPN server. If the new address matches the VPN server, you're good; if not, your VPN is leaking.\nFirst, we checked the Windows app with split tunneling active to ensure the flaw really had been patched. We tested several servers and didn't find any leaks, which suggests the patch worked, though leaks were rare even before ExpressVPN fixed the vulnerability.\n\n\n\n   We checked our IP while connected to the virtual India location, which is run from a physical server in Singapore. Don't worry -- it still looks like India to streaming services. \n \n\n   Sam Chapman for Engadget \n \n\nIn fact, we didn't find any leaks on any ExpressVPN server we tested on any platform. Though questions remain about iOS, as you'll see later in this section, that's a problem on Apple's end that even the best VPNs can do very little about for now.\nThe most common cause of VPN leaks is the use of public DNS servers to connect users to websites, which can mistakenly send browsing activity outside the VPN's encrypted tunnel. ExpressVPN avoids the risks of the public system by installing its own DNS resolvers on every server. This is the key factor behind its clean bill of health in our leak testing.\nTwo other common flaws can lead to VPN leaks: WebRTC traffic and IPv6. The former is a communication protocol used in live streaming and the latter is a new IP standard designed to expand domain availability. Both are nice, but currently optional, so ExpressVPN automatically blocks both to ensure there's no opportunity for leaks to arise.\nOne note about VPN security on iOS: it's a known and continuing problem that iOS VPNs do not prevent many online apps from communicating with Apple directly, outside the VPN tunnel. This risks leaking sensitive data, even with Lockdown Mode active in iOS 16. A blog post by Proton VPN shares a workaround: connect to a VPN server, then turn Airplane Mode on and off again to end all connections that were active before you connected to the VPN.\nTesting encryption\nWe finished up our battery of security tests by checking out ExpressVPN's encryption directly. Using WireShark, a free packet sniffer, we inspected what it looks like when ExpressVPN transmits data from one of its servers to the internet. The screenshot below shows a data stream encrypted with Lightway UDP.\n\n\n\n   After connecting to ExpressVPN, HTTP packets were rendered unreadable while in transit. \n \n\n   Sam Chapman for Engadget \n \n\nThat lack of any identifiable information, or even readable information, means encryption is working as intended. We repeated the test several times, always getting the same result. This left us satisfied that ExpressVPN's core features are working as intended.\nHow much does ExpressVPN cost?\nExpressVPN subscriptions cost $12.95 per month. Long-term subscriptions can bring the monthly cost down, but the great deals they offer tend to only last for the first billing period.\nA 12-month subscription costs $99.95 and includes three months for free with your first payment, costing a total of $6.67 per month. The bonus disappears for all subsequent years, raising the monthly cost to $8.33. You can also sign up for 28 months at a cost of $139.72, but this is also once-only — ExpressVPN can only be renewed at the $99.95 per year level.\nThere are two ways to test ExpressVPN for free before making a financial commitment. Users on iOS and Android can download the ExpressVPN app without entering any payment details and use it free for seven days. On any platform, there's a 30-day money-back guarantee, which ExpressVPN has historically honored with no questions asked. You will have to pay before you can use it, though.\nIn our opinion, ExpressVPN's service is solid enough that it's worth paying extra. Perhaps not this much extra, but that depends on what you get out of it. We recommend using the 30-day refund period and seeing how well ExpressVPN works for you. If it's a VPN you can enjoy using, that runs fast and unblocks everything you need, that's worth a server's weight in gold.\nExpressVPN side apps and bundles\nExpressVPN includes some special features that work mostly or wholly separate from its VPN apps. Some of these come free with a subscription, while others add an extra cost.\nEvery subscription includes the ExpressVPN keys password manager. This is available under its own tab on the Android and iOS apps. On desktop, you'll need to download a separate extension from your browser's store, then sign in using your account activation code. It's available on all Chromium browsers, but not Firefox.\nStarting in 2025, new subscribers get an eSIM plan through holiday.com, a separate service linked to ExpressVPN. The baseline 1GB holiday eSIM plans last for 5 days and can apply to countries, regions, or the entire world (though it's not clear whether the package deal applies to the regional and global plans). Longer-term plans include larger eSIM plans.\nYou can add a dedicated IP address to your ExpressVPN subscription for an additional cost per month. A dedicated IP lets you use the same IP address every time you connect to ExpressVPN. You can add the address to whitelists on restricted networks, and you're assured to never be blocked because of someone else's bad activity on a shared IP.\nUnlike many of its competitors, ExpressVPN doesn't currently offer antivirus or online storage services, but there is a comprehensive bundle of ID protection tools called Identity Defender. We haven't reviewed any of these products in detail, but here's a list for reference:\n\nID Alerts will inform you if any of your sensitive information is leaked or misused online. It's free with all plans, but you'll have to enter your personal information on your ExpressVPN account page or a mobile app.\nID Theft Insurance grants up to $1 million in identity theft reimbursement and comes free with new ExpressVPN one-year or two-year subscriptions. It's not yet available to those who subscribed before it launched in October 2024.\nData Removal scans for your information in data brokerages and automatically requests that it be deleted. It's also free with one-year and two-year plans.\nCredit Scanner is only available for United States users. It monitors your activity on the three credit bureaus so you can quickly spot any suspicious transactions.\n\nThe Identity Defender features are currently only available to new ExpressVPN customers in the US.\nClose-reading ExpressVPN's privacy policy\nAlthough we worry that the consolidation of VPN brands under the umbrella of Kape Technologies (ExpressVPN's parent company) will make the industry less competitive, we don't believe it's influencing ExpressVPN to take advantage of its users' privacy. To confirm, and get a full sense of what sort of privacy ExpressVPN promises its users, we set out to read ExpressVPN's privacy policy in detail. It's long, but thankfully aimed at casual users instead of lawyers. You can see it for yourself here.\nIn the introduction, ExpressVPN states that it does not keep either activity logs (such as a user's browsing history while connected to the VPN) or connection logs (such as the duration of a user's session and their IP address, which can be used to extrapolate browsing activity). It then specifies the seven types of data it's legally allowed to collect:\n\nData used to sign up for an account, such as names, emails and payment methods.\nVPN usage data which is aggregated and can't be traced to any individual.\nCredentials stored in the ExpressVPN Keys password manager.\nDiagnostic data such as crash reports, which are only shared upon user request.\nIP addresses authorized for MediaStreamer, which is only for streaming devices that don't otherwise support VPN apps.\nMarketing data collected directly from the app — a \"limited amount\" that's kept anonymous.\nData voluntarily submitted for identity theft protection apps.\n\nOf those seven exceptions, the only ones that count as red flags are account data and marketing data. Both categories are highly personal and could be damaging if mishandled. Fortunately, complying with subpoenas is not one of the allowed uses listed for either data category, nor does the policy let ExpressVPN sell the data to other private parties.\nThe only really annoying thing here is that if you ask ExpressVPN to delete your personal data, you won't be able to use your account from then on. You aren't even eligible for a refund in this case, unless you're within 30 days of your initial subscription.\nAs for marketing data, ExpressVPN collects device fingerprints and location data when you sign up for an account on its website. The privacy policy also claims this is anonymized, as its \"systems are engineered to decouple such data from personally identifiable information.\" Audits corroborate this, as we'll see in the next section. So, while it would be better if ExpressVPN didn't collect any personal data at all, its practices don't appear to pose a risk to anything you do while using the VPN — just the ExpressVPN website.\nPrivacy audits\nVPN providers often get third-party accounting firms to audit their privacy policies. The idea is that a well-known firm won't mortgage its reputation to lie on behalf of a VPN, so their results can be trusted.\nFor the last several years, ExpressVPN has had KPMG look over its privacy policy and relevant infrastructure (see \"TrustedServer\" below). KPMG's most recent report, completed in December 2023 and released in May 2024, found that ExpressVPN had enough internal controls in place that users could trust its privacy policy.\nThe report is freely available to read. This is a very good sign, though we're looking out for a more up-to-date audit soon.\nTrustedServer\n\"TrustedServer\" is a marketing term ExpressVPN uses for its RAM-only server infrastructure. RAM-only servers have no hard drives for long-term storage and return to a standard disk image with every reboot. This makes it theoretically impossible to store user activity logs on them, even if ExpressVPN wanted to do that.\nThe KPMG audit, linked above, reports that TrustedServer works as advertised. Between its many clean privacy audits and the Turkish server incident in 2017, we're prepared to say ExpressVPN is a private VPN, in spite of its aggravating exception for marketing.\nCan ExpressVPN change your virtual location?\nNext, we tested whether ExpressVPN can actually convince websites that you're somewhere other than your real location. Our security tests have already proven it can hide your IP address, but it takes more than leak-proofing to fool streaming sites these days — Netflix and the others have gotten very good at combing through metadata to sniff out proxy users.\nThe process for testing this is a lot like how we handled the DNS leak tests: try several different servers and see if we get caught. We checked five sample locations outside the U.S. to see if we a) got into Netflix and b) saw different titles in the library. The results are below.\n\n\n\nServer Location\nUnblocked Netflix?\nLibrary changed?\n\n\nCanada\nY\nY\n\n\nUnited Kingdom\nY (second try; Docklands failed)\nY\n\n\nSlovakia\nY\nY\n\n\nIndia\nY\nY (different from UK library)\n\n\nAustralia\nY\nY\n\n\n\nIn fifteen tests, ExpressVPN slipped up only once. Docklands, the UK server it chose as the fastest, wasn't able to access Netflix. We switched to a server labeled simply \"London\" and unblocked it without issue.\n\n\n\n   ExpressVPN can change your virtual location so you can explore the wonderful world of K-drama. \n \n\n   Sam Chapman for Engadget \n \n\nAll the other locations got us access to an alternate Netflix library on the first try. We even checked whether the India server, which is physically located in the UK, showed us different videos than the UK servers. It did, which makes us even more confident that ExpressVPN's virtual locations are airtight.\nInvestigating ExpressVPN's server network\nExpressVPN users can connect to a total of 164 server locations in 105 countries and territories. These locations are reasonably well distributed across the globe, but as with all VPNs, there's a bias toward the northern hemisphere. There are 24 locations in the U.S. alone and a further 66 in Europe.\nThat isn't to say users in the Global South get nothing. ExpressVPN has IP addresses from nine nations in South America (Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Uruguay and Venezuela) and six in Africa (Algeria, Egypt, Ghana, Kenya, Morocco and South Africa). The network even includes Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Mongolia, impressive since central Asia may be the region most often shafted by VPNs.\nHowever, many of these servers have virtual locations different from their real ones. For those of you choosing a server based on performance instead of a particular IP address, ExpressVPN's website has a helpful list of which servers are virtual. The bad news is that it's a big chunk of the list. A total of 63 ExpressVPN locations are virtual, or 38% of its entire network.\nTo reduce the sting, ExpressVPN takes care to locate virtual servers as close to their real locations as possible. Its virtual locations in Indonesia and India are physically based in Singapore. This isn't always practical, leading to some awkwardness like operating a Ghana IP address out of Germany. But it helps ExpressVPN perform better in the southern hemisphere.\nExtra features of ExpressVPN\nCompared to direct competitors like NordVPN and Surfshark, ExpressVPN doesn't have many special features. It's aimed squarely at the casual market and will probably disappoint power users. Having said that, what they do include works well. In this section, we'll run through ExpressVPN's four substantial features outside its VPN servers themselves.\nNetwork Lock kill switch\n\"Network Lock\" is the name ExpressVPN gives to its kill switch (though it's called \"Network Protection\" on mobile). A VPN kill switch is a safety feature that keeps you from broadcasting outside the VPN tunnel. If it ever detects that you aren't connected to a legitimate ExpressVPN server, it cuts off your internet access. You won't be able to get back online until you either reconnect to the VPN or disable Network Lock.\n\n\n\n   ExpressVPN's kill switch is called Network Lock on desktop, and Network Protection on mobile (Android pictured) \n \n\n   Sam Chapman for Engadget \n \n\nThis is important for everyone, not just users who need to hide sensitive traffic. The recently discovered TunnelVision bug theoretically allows hackers to set up fake public wi-fi networks through which they redirect you to equally fake VPN servers, which then harvest your personal information. It's unlikely, but not impossible, and a kill switch is the best way to prevent it — the switch always triggers unless you're connected to a real server in the VPN's network.\nLike most of ExpressVPN's features, all you can do with Network Lock is turn it on and off. You can also toggle whether you'll still be able to access local devices while the kill switch is blocking your internet — this is allowed by default.\nThreat manager, ad blocker and parental controls\nExpressVPN groups three tools under the heading of \"advanced protection\" — Threat Manager, an ad blocker and parental controls. Threat Manager consists of two checkboxes: one that blocks your browser from communicating with activity tracking software and one that blocks a list of websites known to be used for malware.\n\n\n\n   Check any of these boxes to use the pre-set blocklists whenever you're connected to ExpressVPN. \n \n\n   Sam Chapman for Engadget \n \n\nYou can't customize the lists, so you're limited to what ExpressVPN considers worthy of blocking. They share their sources on the website. While the lists are extensive and open-source, they rely on after-the-fact reporting and can't detect and block unknown threats like a proper antivirus.\nThe adblock and parental control options work the same way: check a box to block everything on the list, uncheck it to allow everything through. In tests, the ad blocker was nearly 100% effective against banner ads, but failed to block any video ads on YouTube or Netflix.\nThe parental control option blocks a list of porn sites. It's an easy option for concerned parents, but only works while ExpressVPN is connected. As such, it's meant to be used in conjunction with device-level parental controls that prevent the child from turning off or uninstalling the VPN client.\nSplit tunneling\nSometimes, you'll find it helpful to have your device getting online through two different IP addresses at once — one for your home services and one for a location you're trying to spoof. That's where split tunneling is helpful: it runs some apps through the VPN while leaving others unprotected. This can also improve your speeds, since the VPN needs to encrypt less in total.\n\n\n\n   You can configure split tunneling through either a blocklist or an allowlist. \n \n\n   Sam Chapman for Engadget \n \n\nExpressVPN includes split tunneling on Windows, Android and Mac (though only on versions 10 and below). You can only split by app, not by website, but it's still pretty useful. For example, you can have BitTorrent handling a heavy download in the background while you use your browser for innocuous activities that don't need protecting.\nExpressVPN Aircove router\nBy now, it should be clear that we find ExpressVPN to be a highly reliable but often unexceptional VPN service. However, there's one area in which it's a clear industry leader: VPN routers. ExpressVPN Aircove is, to our knowledge, the only router with a built-in commercial VPN that comes with its own dashboard interface.\nUsually, installing a VPN on your router requires tinkering with the router control panel, which turns off all but the most experienced users — not to mention making it a massive pain to switch to a new server location. Aircove's dashboard, by contrast, will be instantly familiar to anyone who already knows how to use an ExpressVPN client. It even allows different devices in your home to connect to different locations through the router VPN.\nAircove's biggest drawback is its price. Currently retailing at $189 (not including an ExpressVPN subscription), it's around three times more expensive than an aftermarket router fitted with free VPN firmware. Some of you might still find the convenience worth the one-time payment.\nExpressVPN customer support options\nExpressVPN's written help pages are some of the best on the market. Its live chat is more of a mixed bag, and complex questions may cause delays. However, it is at least staffed with human agents who aim to reply accurately, rather than resolve your ticket as quickly as possible.\n\n\n\n   You can directly access both live chat and email from ExpressVPN's mobile apps (on desktop, you'll have to go to the website). \n \n\n   Sam Chapman for Engadget \n \n\nWe approached ExpressVPN's support features with a simple question: \"If I requested that ExpressVPN delete all my personal data, would I be able to get a refund for my unused subscription time?\" (Remember from the Privacy Policy section that submitting a full deletion request also cancels your ExpressVPN account.)\nOur first stop was expressvpn.com/support, the written support center and FAQ page. It's divided into setup guides, troubleshooting, account management and information on each of ExpressVPN's products. The setup guides are excellent, including screenshots and clearly written steps; each one includes a video guide for those who learn better that way.\nTroubleshooting is just as good — no videos, but the same standards of clarity and usefulness prevail. The section starts with general problems, then delves into specific issues you might face on each operating system. Each article clearly derives from a real customer need.\nThe live support experience\nTo get answers on our refund question, we visited the account management FAQs. This section stated that the refund policy only applies within 30 days of purchase. Pretty clear-cut, but we still wanted an answer on our special case, so we contacted live chat by clicking the button at the bottom-right of every FAQ page.\n\n\n\n   Live chat is in the bottom-right corner of every page of expressvpn.com. \n \n\n   Sam Chapman for Engadget \n \n\nLive chat starts with an AI assistant, which is not too hard to get past — just ask it a question it can't answer, then click \"Transfer to an Agent.\" We got online with (what claimed to be) a human in less than a minute. Answering the question took longer and involved an uncomfortable 10-minute silence, but we did get a clear verdict from a real person: refunds are within 30 days only, no matter what.\nIf the live chat agent can't answer your question, you'll be redirected to open an email support ticket. Annoyingly, there's no way to go directly to email support through the website or desktop apps, though mobile users have the option to skip directly there.\nExpressVPN background check: From founding to Kape Technologies\nExpressVPN launched in 2009, which makes it one of the oldest consumer VPNs in continual operation. In more than 15 years of operation, it's never been caught violating its own privacy policy, though its record isn't free of more minor blemishes.\nHeadquarters in the British Virgin Islands\nFounders Dan Pomerantz and Peter Burchhardt registered the company in the British Virgin Islands from the start to take advantage of that territory's favorable legal environment for online privacy. The BVIs have no law requiring businesses to retain data on their users, and the process for extraditing data is famously difficult, requiring a direct order from the highest court.\nIn 2021, the BVI implemented the Data Protection Act (DPA) [PDF link], which prevents companies based in the territory from accessing data on their users anywhere in the world. It's a great privacy law in theory, modeled on best-in-class legislation in the EU. However, we couldn't find any evidence that its supervising authority — the Office of the Information Commissioner — has a leader or staff.\nIn other words, while ExpressVPN is not legally required to log any data on its users, there's technically nobody stopping them from doing so. Whether you trust the jurisdiction depends on whether you trust the company itself. Let's see what the other evidence says.\nSecurity and privacy incidents\nTwo significant incidents stand out from ExpressVPN's 16-year history. In 2017, when Andrei Karlov, Russia's ambassador to Turkey, was shot to death at an art show. Turkish police suspected someone had used ExpressVPN to mask their identity while they deleted information from social media accounts belonging to the alleged assassin. To investigate, they confiscated an ExpressVPN server to comb for evidence. They didn't find anything.\nA police seizure is the best possible test of a VPN's approach to privacy. The provider can't prepare beforehand, fake anything, or collude with investigators. The Turkey incident is still one of the best reasons to recommend ExpressVPN, though eight years is a long time for policy to change.\nThe second incident began in March 2024, when a researcher at CNET informed ExpressVPN that its version 12 for Windows occasionally leaked DNS requests when users enabled the split tunneling feature. While these users remained connected to an ExpressVPN server, their browsing activity was often going directly to their ISP, unmasked.\nThe bug only impacted a few users, and to their credit, ExpressVPN sprang into action as soon as they learned about it. The team had it patched by April, as confirmed by the researcher who initially discovered the vulnerability. But while their quick and effective response deserves praise, it's still a mark against them that a journalist noticed the bug before they did.\nKape Technologies ownership and management questions\nIn 2021, an Israeli-owned, UK-based firm called Kape Technologies purchased a controlling interest in ExpressVPN. In addition to ExpressVPN, privately held Kape owns CyberGhost, Private Internet Access, and Zenmate (before it merged into CyberGhost). As shown on its website, it also owns Webselenese, publisher of VPN review websites WizCase and vpnMentor, which poses an apparent conflict of interest.\nWhen reached for comment, a representative for ExpressVPN said that \"ExpressVPN does not directly engage with, nor seek to influence, the content on any Webselenese site,\" and pointed us to disclosure statements on the websites in question — here's one example. Even so, it's a good reminder not to take VPN reviews at face value without knowing who's behind them (Engadget is owned by Yahoo, which does not own any VPNs).\nDiving deeper into the background of Kape's ownership will lead you to owner Teddy Sagi. Go back far enough, and you'll see he did prison time in Israel and was mentioned in the Pandora Papers, among other things. More recently, headlines about the billionaire have focused more his businesses in the online gambling and fintech arenas, as well as his real estate ventures. An ExpressVPN representative told us that \"Kape's brands continue to operate independently,\" and our investigation bore that out — we couldn't find any proof that Kape or Sagi have directly attempted to influence ExpressVPN's software or daily operations.\nCloser to the immediate day-to-day operations of ExpressVPN was the company's employment of Daniel Gericke as CTO from 2019 through 2023. During that time, the US Justice Department announced it had fined Gericke and two others for their previous employment on a surveillance operation called Project Raven, which the United Arab Emirates (UAE) used to spy on its own citizens.\nThe revelation prompted a public response from ExpressVPN defending its decision to hire Gericke, arguing that \"[t]he best goalkeepers are the ones trained by the best strikers.\" ExpressVPN's representative confirmed that the company still stands by that linked statement.\nGericke parted ways with ExpressVPN in October 2023, per his LinkedIn profile. While we don't know what we don't know, we can say that ExpressVPN has not notably changed its public-facing security and privacy policies during the time it's been connected to Kape, Sagi, or Gericke.\nIn the end, how much ExpressVPN's history matters to you is a personal choice. If you object to any current or past actions by Kape Technologies or Teddy Sagi, there are other premium VPN options you might prefer. If you need more information to make up your mind, we recommend reading through CNET's 2022 deep dive on ExpressVPN's corporate history.\nFinal verdict\nExpressVPN is the VPN we most often recommend to beginners. It takes zero training to use, and consistently gets past filters on streaming sites. It also runs in the background with virtually no impact. If anything is worth the high price of admission, it's the excellent speeds distributed evenly across the worldwide server network.\nHowever, for certain specific cases, ExpressVPN may not be the best choice. There's no way to set up your own server locations, like NordVPN offers, and no double VPN connections, like you can build for yourself on Surfshark. Its corporate background is more suspect than the entities backing Proton VPN, and unlike Mullvad, ExpressVPN doesn't work in China — it's so well-known that the government targets its servers specifically.\nWe suggest going with ExpressVPN for general online privacy, for spoofing locations in your home country while traveling, or if you regularly need to unblock sites in other countries. That encompasses 19 of every 20 users, which is fine by us, as ExpressVPN is a great service. It's just more of a reliable old screwdriver than a multi-tool.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/expressvpn-review-2025-fast-speeds-and-a-low-learning-curve-160052884.html?src=rss",

Editor's note (7/25/25): We're in the process of revamping our VPN coverage to provide more in-depth, actionable information and buying guides. This Ookla speedtest shows you can still get fast internet while connected to ExpressVPN -- our unprotected speeds are around 58 Mbps. It's similar to WireGuard, in that both reach for faster speeds and lower processing demands by keeping their codebases slim. We checked our IP while connected to the virtual India location, which is run from a physical server in Singapore. The privacy policy also claims this is anonymized, as its \"systems are engineered to decouple such data from personally identifiable information.\" For the last several years, ExpressVPN has had KPMG look over its privacy policy and relevant infrastructure (see \"TrustedServer\" below). ExpressVPN groups three tools under the heading of \"advanced protection\" — Threat Manager, an ad blocker and parental controls.

    "summary": "Surfshark is one of the youngest major VPNs, but it's grown rapidly over the last seven years. Since 2018, it's expanded its network to 100 countries, added a suite of apps to its Surfshark One package and experimented with advanced touches like servers that constantly rotate your IP address.\nFormerly a budget VPN, Surfshark is still pretty affordable but the cost of a one-month subscription is way too high. These days, it's more interested in innovation than affordability. Its features may not always be cutting-edge — Nexus is basically Tor and Everlink is a slightly better kill switch — but it's rare to find either implemented so well in a commercial VPN. Plus, download and upload speeds are fantastic. \nIt all adds up to one of the best VPNs for casual users, even when compared to others in its weight class. But those already deeply familiar with VPNs might trip over some aspects. For this review, I studied 11 different angles on Surfshark's service, some through hands-on tests and others with old-fashioned journalism. Check out the sections most important to you, then head to the end for my final verdict.\nEditors' note: We're in the process of rebooting all of our VPN reviews from scratch.

I'll look at how easy or difficult it is to install, what you have to do to set it up and whether the user interface (UI) helps out or gets in the way on each platform.\nWindows\nSurfshark is easy to download and install on Windows. You can get it through the Microsoft store, but going directly through the Surfshark website makes sure you have the latest and most complete version. The downloader asks you to click \"Yes,\" but mostly handles itself, and finishes up in a short time.\n\n\n\n\n   Sam Chapman for Engadget \n \n\nThe first point that might divide casual users and VPN veterans comes once you open the app for the first time. Surfshark insists on taking you through a guided setup process for all its features. This is extremely helpful if you've never used a VPN before. If you have, its repeated insistence on sending you through the tour can get aggravating.\nThis pattern repeated itself as I went through the app. The front page is sensibly organized and arranged so I could see all the facts and settings — but it remains way too reliant on unskippable pop-ups to provide information. Messages appeared when I tried to cancel a stuck connection, when I turned settings on and off and even when I tried to close the app. It's usually important information, but displaying a message that freezes every other button is a bad move.\n\n\n\n\n   Sam Chapman for Engadget \n \n\nIt's a shame, because everything else works fine. The settings tabs do an admirable job of packing multiple, semi-related apps into a single UI. Just take note that a lot of stuff is enabled by default, including auto-connect and NoBorders, which may make the VPN behave in ways you don't need.\nMac\nSurfshark's app for macOS is mostly the same as its Windows app, for better or worse. It's got the same split-second download and installation and the same clear organization of tabs with well-explained features. It's also got the same relentless popups, settings on by default and occasionally sticky connections. If it gets hung up at 95 percent, just wait — it's still working.\n\n\n\n\n   Sam Chapman for Engadget \n \n\nAndroid\nThe Surfshark Android app, available through the Google Play Store, is ready after you simply download and login. It doesn't reinvent the wheel, but Surfshark's design language turns out to be very easy to compress into mobile — except that it's dark-mode by default, while all the other three are light. I found everything I needed within moments. Android even removes almost all the full-screen stop-everything notifications.\n\n\n\n\n   Sam Chapman for Engadget \n \n\nOne thing to be aware of: when you start up the Android app, the VPN is visible, but the landing page includes all the features of Surfshark One. To get the VPN-only front page, click the arrow across from \"VPN\" at the top of the screen. That said, you can do almost everything you need to do no matter which page you're on.\niOS\nIt's unusual to see a big difference between a VPN's apps on the two mobile platforms, but Surfshark switches up its design from Android to iOS. Everything now lives in four tabs on the bottom of the window. The settings tab is great, largely because it looks like how preferences do on Mac and Windows.\n\n\n\n\n   Sam Chapman for Engadget \n \n\nThe main VPN window is a bit jankier. It works fine, but in order to make the server list constantly visible (unnecessary IMO), it relegates the actual VPN connection to a floating box that looks like an afterthought. It even includes a button to open the server list that's already open. I freely admit this is just a personal complaint, but it still baffles me.\nBrowser extensions\nSurfshark's browser extensions for Firefox and Chromium are almost clones of its desktop apps, with a few differences. The Alert tab tells you if the site you're on has suffered a security breach recently. CleanWeb 2.0 is the main reason to add Surfshark to your browser; it's a much stronger blocker that even works on some video insert ads.\n\n\n\n\n   Sam Chapman for Engadget \n \n\nSurfshark speed test: Super fast with some latency\nAll VPNs add to your web browser's workload, so it's normal to see speeds drop. The best VPNs manage to keep the drops as small as possible. I used speedtest.net to see how quickly my download speeds declined at six of Surfshark's server locations — that's a measure of how fast a browser can load web pages, buffer videos and download large files.\nI also looked for latency, which affects real-time communication with another server (important for gamers) and upload speed, which affects how quickly your device can send data (important for torrenting). My results are in the table.\n\n\n\nServer location \nLatency (ms) \nIncrease factor \nDownload speed (Mbps) \nPercentage drop \nUpload speed (Mbps) \nPercentage drop \n\n\nPortland, U.S.A. (unprotected) \n18 \n— \n58.27 \n— \n5.88 \n— \n\n\nBend, U.S.A. (fastest) \n30 \n1.7x \n55.35 \n5.0 \n5.56 \n5.4 \n\n\nMontreal, Canada \n164 \n9.1x \n56.47 \n3.1 \n5.58 \n5.1 \n\n\nBogota, Columbia \n281 \n15.6x \n55.01 \n5.6 \n5.58 \n5.1 \n\n\nJohannesburg, South Africa \n605 \n33.6x \n51.87 \n11.0 \n5.62 \n4.4 \n\n\nDubai, U.A.E. \n534 \n29.7x \n54.53 \n6.4 \n5.74 \n2.4 \n\n\nJakarta, Indonesia \n449 \n24.9x \n57.55 \n1.2 \n5.92 \n-0.7 \n\n\nAverage \n344 \n19.1x \n55.13 \n5.4 \n5.67 \n3.6 \n\n\n\nIn terms of download and upload speeds, Surfshark is the fastest VPN I've tested so far, beating out ExpressVPN, Proton VPN and NordVPN — and none of those are exactly sluggish. If you look at the Indonesia row, you'll see I actually got a higher upload speed than I did without the VPN active. That probably has more to do with natural fluctuations from my ISP than anything Surfshark did, but it still indicates how little this VPN weighs down your browsing.\n\n\n\n\n   Sam Chapman for Engadget \n \n\nLatency is more of a mixed bag. Jumps in ping time are expected across long distances, but I also saw a fairly large jump on a server in the same state as me. Surfshark may not be ideal for fast-paced online games, but its speeds are just about perfect for any other task.\nSurfshark security test: Simple but effective protocols\nTo determine whether Surfshark can keep you safe, I'll be looking at three factors: whether it uses secure and up-to-date VPN protocols, whether any of those protocols leak your IP address and whether encryption is being applied to all data packets. The first is a matter of researching the technology, but I've run practical tests for the other two.\nVPN protocols\nSurfshark uses the VPN protocols WireGuard, OpenVPN (over TCP or UDP) and IKEv2. All of these are field-tested protocols that rely on uncracked encryption and proven authentication methods. There's no proprietary protocol with shady source code, nor any outdated legacy options that might pose a risk if you pick them. My only complaint is that OpenVPN isn't available on Mac.\n\n\n\n\n   Sam Chapman for Engadget \n \n\nEach of these protocols does the same thing: establish communication between your device, VPN servers and the internet. They handle the steps differently, but the average user is only likely to see small differences. If one protocol isn't working, you can switch to another — or just pick the automatic protocol selection option, which worked fine during my tests. If you want to pick for yourself, use the table below for reference.\n\n\n\nProtocol \nUse case \nAvailable on \nOther notes \n\n\nWireGuard \nGenerally provides the best speeds \nAll platforms \nSaves static IP addresses, but Surfshark masks these with dynamic IPs for users \n\n\nOpenVPN over TCP \nWhen the other protocols have dropped your connection \nAll platforms except macOS and iOS \nAutomatic obfuscation \n\n\nOpenVPN over UDP \nWhen you need speed more than stability (and WireGuard isn't working) \nAll platforms except macOS and iOS \nAutomatic obfuscation \n\n\nIKEv2 \nOn mobile, as it's good at reconnecting when moving between Wi-Fi and data \nAll platforms except Windows \nNot open source \n\n\n\nLeak test\nNext, I picked five of the servers I didn't use for the speed test and checked all of them for three different kinds of leaks using ipleak.net. Surfshark has its own DNS servers, so DNS leaks are unlikely — those usually come from a VPN using public servers to resolve DNS requests. As expected, DNS requests didn't reveal my IP address in any of the tests.\n\n\n\n\n   Sam Chapman for Engadget \n \n\nThere's more potential for IPv6 leaks, as Surfshark doesn't support IPv6. It recommends turning it off instead, and has guides on doing that. To fully put Surfshark through its paces, though, I ran my tests with IPv6 still active on my computer. On all five servers, the IPv6 test could not run. This indicates that Surfshark actively blocks IPv6, which (until more of the internet starts running on the new protocol) is a fine way to prevent IPv6 leaks.\nThe leak testing tool also checks for WebRTC leaks, so I ran each test with a Google Meet call active, but that didn't leak either. In short, Surfshark didn't spring a leak no matter how many times I poked it. I'm prepared to call it watertight.\nEncryption test\nTo be absolutely sure I was recommending a safe VPN, I used WireShark (no relation) and HTTP Forever to see whether its encryption works. From examining the data stream before and after connecting to a Surfshark server, it's clear that encryption is truly being applied. Take a look for yourself — the fact that you can't get any information from the screenshot means the VPN protocol is working.\n\n\n\n\n   Sam Chapman for Engadget \n \n\nHow much does Surfshark cost?\nSurfshark is part of a suite of security products — a lot like its sister brand NordVPN, but with the offerings per tier a little more coherent. It comes in three subscription types, each of which is available at three durations. The table below shows the whole range of costs.\nNote that the 24-month plans are introductory only. You can only renew for one month or 12 months. The prices below also factor in extra months you'll get when you sign up for the first time, which aren't available in renewals.\n\n\n\nPlan \nOne month \n12 months \n24 months \n\n\nSurfshark Starter \n$15.45 \n$48.75 ($3.19/month with 3 extra months) \n$53.73 ($1.99/month with 3 extra months) \n\n\nSurfshark One \n$17.95 \n$50.85 ($3.39/month with 3 extra months) \n$67.23 ($2.49/month with 3 extra months) \n\n\nSurfshark One+ \n$20.65 \n$91.35 ($6.09/month with 3 extra months) \n$107.73 ($3.99/month with 3 extra months) \n\n\n\nSurfshark's price drops steeply from its shortest to its longest subscriptions. $15.45 is way overpriced (even for a service we quite like), but $1.99 per month is about the least you'll pay for any VPN worth recommending. The jump from Starter (which only includes the VPN service) to One (which includes everything else except Incogni) is also tiny on the 12-month plan — only an extra $0.20.\nSurfshark is almost certainly doing this to juice active user numbers — but that doesn't mean you can't take advantage of it. To our mind, the 12-month subscription to Surfshark One is extremely good value, provided you already know you want Surfshark VPN.\nEvery plan comes with a 30-day money-back guarantee. At any point before 30 days have elapsed, you can start a live chat conversation to get your money back. This is only allowed once every six months.\nYou can also get a free trial for seven days by installing the Surfshark app from the Apple or Android app store, creating an account, then choosing the plan that includes the 7-day free trial. However, since you have to enter a payment method for this — and it's not accessible on Windows — the 30-day period is generally more convenient.\nSurfshark side apps and bundles\nHere's what you can get from Surfshark aside from its VPN service. In order to keep our focus on the VPN, we didn't have time to rigorously test all these, but we've included the basic information to help you make your decision.\nAlternative ID\nAlternative ID is included along with VPN service in a Surfshark Starter plan. It consists of two features: masked email generator and personal detail generator.\nMasked email generator gives you a random email address that sends all messages along to your real inbox. Since it auto-forwards everything, an email mask isn't for reducing spam. Instead, it lets you keep your real email address secret when signing up for online services — since providing your actual address runs the risk of leaking it. For an extra $2.89 per month, you can also get an alternative phone number that works similarly.\n\n\n\n\n   Sam Chapman for Engadget \n \n\nPersonal detail generator creates fake names, addresses and birthdays you can use to sign up for any websites you're uncertain about. Be sure to use it along with the VPN, or your IP address will reveal the actual details. It also might be helpful for randomly generating your next RPG character.\nSurfshark Antivirus\nSurfshark Antivirus is included in Surfshark One and One+ subscriptions. It can scan files as you download them and can also scan your whole system for malware, checking against a list of unwanted programs it claims to update every three hours.\nAV-Test gave it a perfect score in protection. A top score (6 out of 6) means Surfshark Antivirus caught 100 percent of malware thrown at it, both known threats and zero-day attacks. It also got a perfect usability score for totally avoiding false positives, and a 5.5 out of 6 on performance — it had nearly no impact on downloading apps or copying files, but slowed down popular websites by around 30 percent on average.\nSurfshark Alert\nSurfshark Alert, which is also part of Surfshark One and One+, scans the information released in data breaches to see if any of your important data has been compromised. It can check for email addresses, usernames, passwords, credit card numbers and government IDs. It can also warn you when malware on your computer is capable of stealing your data.\nSurfshark Search\nYou can get access to Surfshark Search, a search engine akin to Google, with a One or One+ subscription. It offers a number of benefits over Google, including being totally ad-free (a perk of being subsidized by subscription). You can also change the region from which you get results. Surfshark claims that all results are totally organic, with no trackers or learning from logged searches.\nIncogni\nIncogni, an automated data removal service, is the one feature restricted to Surfshark One+ plans. It searches data brokerages to see if they have any of your information, then contacts them for you to request they purge the data. Brokers don't have to honor all deletion requests, but it never hurts to try. Incogni keeps searching as long as your subscription is active, so it can automatically send multiple requests to the same broker if necessary.\nSaily eSIM\nSeveral VPNs now provide their users with Saily eSIM discounts, which can be used to get regular phone service in foreign countries. Surfshark grants various discounts through the coupon code surfshark5, which appears to be usable even without a Surfshark account.\nClose-reading Surfshark's privacy policy\nSurfshark's privacy policy shows us its outward attitude toward user privacy. While it's possible for a VPN provider to lie outright in its posted policy, they prefer not to for liability reasons. An unreliable service will instead use loopholes, vagueries and incomplete statements to make privacy promises it doesn't plan on keeping.\nBy contrast, a VPN service worth your money will be as specific as possible about any exceptions to its no-logs policy. I read Surfshark's entire privacy policy to see which type of VPN it is — no small feat, as it's well over 5,000 words long. The page includes summaries, but they're pared down a little too far to be useful, so it's into the full text I go.\n\n\n\n\n   Sam Chapman for Engadget \n \n\nSurfshark is based in the Netherlands, which makes it subject to the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). That's good news, since GDPR does not permit any company to retain data without justifying it. The Netherlands is likely part of the Nine Eyes intelligence-sharing agreement, but agencies can't spy on a VPN's users unless that VPN is already saving activity logs — and if it is, it's got much bigger problems than where it's based.\nSurfshark's entire server network runs on RAM-only infrastructure, so any saved activity is erased at regular intervals. Even better, the policy is clear that your activity on any server is deleted within 15 minutes. If we take Surfshark at its word, there's very little reason to worry about servers being seized or searched.\nThat means the only risk is that Surfshark itself might take advantage of its access to your information. It does, unfortunately, claim the right to view information gathered by third-party trackers, such as the cookies used by social media sites to track ad performance. But none of those trackers are watching what you do when you use the VPN, nor digging into your actual browsing activity — which, as we've seen, doesn't exist after 15 minutes.\nIndependent privacy audits\nAlthough we can't conclusively verify any VPN's privacy policy, since that involves the logically impossible feat of proving a negative, we can get very close by checking independent audits. Third-party auditors can verify a VPN's public statements through a combination of interviews, document review and directly tinkering with the infrastructure.\nSurfshark passed its most recent audit in June 2025, which — at time of writing — leaves very little room for interference. Deloitte, the audit firm, concluded that \"the configuration of IT systems and management of the supporting IT operations is properly prepared, in all material respects in accordance with the Surfshark’s description set out in the Appendix I.\"\nI checked that description and found that it matches up to Surfshark's public privacy policy. So, as much as we can say that any VPN is private, Surfshark is private. It may not stop all personalized ads, but it will at least keep your personal information secret.\nCan Surfshark change your virtual location?\nIf you mainly need a VPN for streaming, this is the section for you. Here, I test whether Surfshark can change your location convincingly enough for you to see content from other countries, without getting caught and blocked by streaming platforms.\n\n\n\n\n   Sam Chapman for Engadget \n \n\nThe procedure is simple: I pick five test locations, connect to three different servers in each and load Netflix. If I get in cleanly without error messages, and actually see different shows than I would without a VPN, I'll know Surfshark convincingly changed my location. (As a reminder, when unblocking with any VPN, always make sure you're logged into your streaming account first.)\n\n\n\nServer Location \nUnblocked Netflix? \nChanged content? \n\n\nCanada \n3/3 \n3/3 \n\n\nIreland \n3/3 \n3/3 \n\n\nColombia \n3/3 \n3/3 \n\n\nSouth Africa \n3/3 \n3/3 \n\n\nJapan \n2/3 \n2/3 \n\n\n\nSurfshark performed extremely well in this test, not only unblocking every location at least twice but also maintaining fast enough speeds to keep the videos from stuttering. The only failure was that one server in Japan got spied out as a VPN and blocked. However, simply disconnecting and reconnecting was enough to get me over the hurdle.\n\n\n\n\n   Sam Chapman for Engadget \n \n\nAny failure to change virtual location counts against a VPN, but even the best services can't keep their servers off 100 percent of blocklists. NordVPN, another top-five VPN, scored the same 14/15. As far as I'm concerned, that's a passing grade for streaming — but if it's a dealbreaker for you, remember ExpressVPN and Proton VPN both have perfect scores.\nInvestigating Surfshark's server network\nSurfshark has a total of 100 server locations in 141 countries. Of those locations, 47 are virtual and 92 are physical. A virtual VPN server gives you an apparent digital location different from where it's really located. There's little security tradeoff, but speeds may vary depending on how far you are from the server's actual position. The one count against Surfshark here is that it doesn't clarify where its virtual servers are really located, so using them is a speed crapshoot.\nThe table below shows the proportions of server locations in each region, so you can decide whether Surfshark is likely to be useful for where you are. You can find a full list on Surfshark's website, though only the apps show which servers are actually virtual.\n\n\n\nRegion \nCountries with servers \nTotal server locations \nVirtual server locations \n\n\nNorth America \n8 \n32 \n5 \n\n\nSouth America \n10 \n10 \n6 \n\n\nEurope \n46 \n58 \n13 \n\n\nAfrica \n6 \n6 \n4 \n\n\nMiddle East \n3 \n3 \n1 \n\n\nAsia \n25 \n26 \n18 \n\n\nOceania \n2 \n6 \n0 \n\n\nTotal \n100 \n141 \n47 (33%) \n\n\n\nThese numbers are interesting in a few ways. First, Surfshark's server network is only about one-third virtual, the lowest proportion of any major VPN I've reviewed so far. There's also no continent without a single physical server. This makes Surfshark a very good choice to guarantee usable internet speeds while globetrotting.\nAs usual, servers are mostly in Europe and North America, although there's a fair amount of Asia represented by the virtual locations. Surfshark is newer than most of its competitors, so it's impressive that it's built such an extensive network in half the time. The table reveals a VPN service that's interested in expanding, but won't do so at the expense of establishing quality locations that actually work.\nExtra features of Surfshark\nSurfshark sets itself apart from the VPN pack with several features, some visible to the user and some working behind the scenes. Mostly, its features are familiar concepts implemented well, rather than outright innovations like NordVPN's Meshnet — but there's a lot of possibility for exciting new directions.\nUnderlying technology: Surfshark Nexus and Everlink\nSurfshark has two technological innovations under the hood that make its VPN relatively unique. The first is Nexus, which has been active since 2022. Nexus connects all Surfshark's servers together into a tighter network than most VPNs use. All its servers are nodes in a web of interconnected paths, a lot like the Tor network, except proprietary to one company.\nWhen you choose a server location, you're only selecting the last node in a sequence. Surfshark software selects the entry point and the path to your chosen exit. This gives every user more options for a working connection path, and allows Surfshark to regularly rotate your apparent IP address so activity on one masked identity can't trace back to you. It's also what makes it possible to pick the two steps in a double-hop connection (see \"Dynamic MultiHop\" below).\n\n\n\n\n   Sam Chapman for Engadget \n \n\nEverlink is a newer technology that Surfshark calls a \"self-healing VPN infrastructure.\" Any time you're connected to Surfshark through the WireGuard protocol, you're also connected to Everlink — a parallel infrastructure that watches your VPN connection. If it ever drops, Everlink instantly reconnects you to another server nearby, theoretically so fast you won't notice the outage.\nThis is basically one step up from a kill switch. Instead of cutting off your connection, Everlink switches it to the next server instead. This makes it difficult to test — the way to check a kill switch is to simulate a server drop by cutting off your own internet connection, which makes Everlink's function impossible. However, I can at least say I'm cautiously excited about Everlink's potential power to negate server drops.\nUnlimited simultaneous connections\nOne thing you'll regularly hear about Surfshark is that it puts no limits on how many devices can connect through your account. In theory, one subscription is enough for you, your household and any friends that want to borrow it.\nIn practice, though, \"unlimited\" is a stretch. A support article acknowledges that some people may abuse the privilege by reselling access, or by masking illegal botnet activity behind hundreds of Surfshark connections.\nThe article doesn't explicitly say Surfshark will limit or ban abusers, but questions to the support team revealed that an account could be locked if an automated system detects fraud. If you use a high number of simultaneous connections, even legitimately, you could be flagged — though you may be able to unlock your account by telling customer service what happened.\nBypasser split tunneling\nBypasser lets you split your internet connection so certain apps or websites go through the VPN while others remain outside. This gets you better speeds on sites and apps that don't involve any sensitive information. Also, whenever a service requires your real IP address, you can keep using the VPN for everything else. Torrenting is a classic use case — you can keep BitTorrent protected in the background while you do something innocuous without VPN protection, improving speeds for both processes.\n\n\n\n\n   Sam Chapman for Engadget \n \n\nBypasser split tunneling is available on all of Surfshark's desktop and mobile clients, though iOS users can only split by website, not by app. Windows and Android users can also choose between two forms of split: \"Bypass VPN,\" which keeps all listed sites and apps outside the VPN tunnel, and \"Route via VPN,\" in which only the listed sites and apps stay within the VPN tunnel.\nDynamic MultiHop\nMany VPNs have a double-hop option, which routes connections through two VPN servers to keep you protected in case one breaks. However, most of them restrict you to set paths of two servers. Surfshark is the only VPN that lets you choose both steps, thanks to Nexus pre-establishing paths between all the servers.\n\n\n\n\n   Sam Chapman for Engadget \n \n\nFor the best performance, I recommend picking an entry node near your real location, then choosing your exit node based on what you need to unblock. If you aren't unblocking anything in particular, your best bet is to simply choose two nodes in your own country.\nCamouflage Mode obfuscation\nVPN obfuscation refers to VPNs hiding the fact that they're VPNs at all — so not only is your IP address not your real one, but it doesn't appear to have been changed. Surfshark's obfuscation is called Camouflage Mode. As long as you're connected via OpenVPN, it's active automatically. So, if you suspect an outside firewall is preventing you from getting online while running Surfshark, switching to OpenVPN might solve the problem.\nNoBorders mode\nNoBorders is another option for getting online with Surfshark under external restrictions, especially those imposed by entire governments (like the Great Firewall of China). If Surfshark detects restrictions on internet usage, NoBorders activates and switches you to a server well-placed to get around those restrictions — for example, an IP address from the next country over.\n\n\n\n\n   Sam Chapman for Engadget \n \n\nThe problem with NoBorders is that it's active by default, which may restrict you to certain servers when you don't need the help. I recommend switching NoBorders off in the settings for better performance. It may turn on again if it detects possible restrictions, so check the setting again if you find your speeds slower than usual.\nCleanWeb\nCleanWeb, Surfshark's ad blocker, is available in two forms. The basic version of CleanWeb, which blocks banner ads and trackers, comes with all Surfshark apps.\n\n\n\n\n   Sam Chapman for Engadget \n \n\nCleanWeb 2.0 comes as a browser extension, which means it only works in-browser. However, it's a much stronger blocker, capable of cancelling video ads on streaming and YouTube. It also automatically rejects non-vital cookies on every site so you don't have to click the button — which I appreciated, as my ADHD brain is easily distracted by pop-ups.\nStatic and dedicated IPs\nSurfshark gives you a list of static IP addresses at no extra charge, another rarity among leading VPNs. A static IP means you'll have the same address every time you connect to the VPN, so you won't look suspicious for regularly opening the same service with a different IP. Without this, you'll find yourself hitting CAPTCHAs more often. You can also keep your home device connected to a static IP server and use that to access your home network remotely.\nFor an extra cost, Surfshark also offers dedicated IPs, which are the same as static IPs except you're the only person using them. Sometimes, a static IP can get blocked because of one bad user's behavior; a private dedicated IP removes that risk.\nOther features\nA few other features are worth noting. Surfshark has a kill switch that cuts off your internet connection if your VPN server ever drops — this is largely obsolete with Everlink, but remains in the background as an extra precaution. You can set the VPN to connect automatically except on trusted networks, and can choose the location to which it auto-connects.\n\n\n\n\n   Sam Chapman for Engadget \n \n\nIf you need to briefly work without the VPN, you can pause Surfshark for five minutes, 30 minutes or two hours. Finally, Android users can have their VPN server override their GPS location, moving it to wherever their IP address is currently. You obviously don't want to use this while your phone is navigating you somewhere, but otherwise it's useful for privacy.\nSurfshark customer support options\nSurfshark includes a few links to troubleshooting pages directly in the app, a tantalizingly unfinished feature. If you go to the settings tab and click Get Help and then Browse Guides, you'll see several links to FAQ articles about the version of the VPN client you're using. Clicking any link opens the page in your default browser. Jumping directly from the app to the relevant guide is really convenient, but if your problem isn't one of the five most common, you're out of luck — just click More Guides to go to the main support page.\n\n\n\n\n   Sam Chapman for Engadget \n \n\nOnce you're here, you'll find a helpful set of articles that make good design choices to put the average user at ease. \"Getting started\" includes setup guides for every Surfshark app, with abundant screenshots. Help articles are effectively written from the user's perspective. Instead of technical descriptions of problems, they start with topics like \"I can't connect to Surfshark\" or \"I'm getting an error,\" then provide a sequence of DIY solutions.\nThe only category without a clear direction is \"Surfschool,\" which gathers a disparate bunch of feature explanations, advanced tips and basic VPN information under one heading. If you can't find what you need in the other sections, it may be easier to use the search bar instead of digging around in Surfschool.\nThe live support experience\nTo reach live support, scroll to the bottom of the main support page, then click \"Chat with us.\" A chat window will open in the corner of your screen. I used the live chat support to ask about receiving a link to the test account I used to write this review. As is now standard, I had to work my way past a chatbot first, but that didn't take too long. Once I reached a real person, they resolved my problem right away.\n\n\n\n\n   Sam Chapman for Engadget \n \n\nThe email ticket system is for difficult problems that can't be resolved in a single exchange, so I decided to test it with something a little more complicated. I asked about the status of IKEv2, which Surfshark promised to eliminate in 2022 but has only removed from Windows (this is in fact what they promised to do, but I wasn't aware of that yet).\nI heard back about 22 hours later with a speedy and applicable answer: a representative said that \"currently, Surfshark does not have plans to remove IKEv2 from all operating systems.\" See the next section for details about that risk.\nSurfshark background check: No real blemishes\nSurfshark was founded in 2018, making it a relative newcomer to the security scene, and the VPN was its first product. Alert and Search debuted in 2019, while Antivirus and Incogni joined them in 2021. For the first two years of its existence, Surfshark was part of the Tesonet group, a Lithuanian startup incubator that also helped launch NordVPN (see \"Connection to NordVPN\" below).\nIts youth may be why there are few serious blemishes on Surfshark's record. Like Proton VPN, which is just a year older, it simply hasn't had time to put a foot wrong yet. However, that doesn't mean it's inevitable that Surfshark will screw up at some point. So far, it appears to be learning from its predecessors and avoiding their mistakes.\nThe trusted root certification authority risk\nThe only potential error I can point to hasn't compromised anyone yet, but may in the future. In 2022, Surfshark was one of several VPNs cited for relying on a trusted root certification authority — a verification method that, if compromised, could let an attacker sneak malware onto a user's device using Surfshark's ID badge. There's no record of the certificate actually being exploited, and Surfshark claimed it was necessary to enable the IKEv2 protocol.\nIn response to the report, Surfshark deprecated IKEv2 from its Windows app, which was the only one that used trusted root CAs for IKEv2. It's still available on all OSes except Windows, but a Surfshark rep told me in an email that they don't use trusted root CAs on those platforms, so there's no risk.\nConnection to NordVPN\nIn 2022, Surfshark announced a merger with NordVPN, though both companies repeatedly stressed that nothing about either service would change. According to Surfshark's announcement at the time, \"The idea behind the deal is to align on a tactical level in reaching mutual goals while keeping the autonomy of our operations.\"\nAs of 2025, nothing seems especially merged about NordVPN and Surfshark. Publicly, they're still completely different brands with few mentions of the other on their respective websites. In an email, a Surfshark representative told me that \"Surfshark and Nord Security operate as autonomous companies relying on separate infrastructures, different product development plans and separate customer bases.\"\nThat said, it's worth noting that Surfshark and Nord have a shared lineage in Tesonet, the Lithuania-based tech incubator that, with Nord, shares Tom Okman and Eimantas Sabaliauskas as co-founders, and nurtured Surfshark for the first two years of its life. In the end, a Surfshark representative told Engadget that Surfshark currently \"operates independently\" of Tesonet. Be that as it may, the combination of Surfshark and NordVPN is yet another example an increasingly consolidated VPN industry, where competitors like Kape Technologies and Ziff Davis operate multiple digital service brands under one corporate roof.\nFinal verdict\nIn a lot of ways, Surfshark works hard to earn your trust. Its reliance on brick-and-mortar servers testifies to that, as do its speeds, regular privacy audits and refusal to rest on its laurels. Nexus and Everlink may not be perfectly implicated, but they do have tangible results that indicate they're a lot more than just marketing gimmicks. Both are positive signs of a VPN provider genuinely trying to stand out in a crowded field.\nIt's also a great sign that Surfshark responded to the trusted root CA risk with a targeted intervention. I wish they'd found a way to run IKEv2 on Windows without as much risk (other VPNs manage it), but I can't deny they seem serious about addressing potential issues before they become crises. It's nice that I can enthusiastically recommend Surfshark for its attention to security as well as its speeds and straightforward features.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/surfshark-vpn-review-a-fast-vpn-for-casual-users-170022675.html?src=rss",
    "full_text": "That probably has more to do with natural fluctuations from my ISP than anything Surfshark did, but it still indicates how little this VPN weighs down your browsing. There's no proprietary protocol with shady source code, nor any outdated legacy options that might pose a risk if you pick them. From examining the data stream before and after connecting to a Surfshark server, it's clear that encryption is truly being applied. Several VPNs now provide their users with Saily eSIM discounts, which can be used to get regular phone service in foreign countries.

    "summary": "s.p.l.i.t is the most badass typing game I’ve ever played. It’s actually more of a hacking simulator, cyberpunk thriller and puzzle experience than a typing game, but its core loop is bookended by sequences of high-intensity letter pecking with gruesome consequences — think Mavis Beacon as designed by Ted Kaczynski — and the final scenes have a way of searing themselves into your psyche. Not to mention, the whole thing takes place on a keyboard, no mouse or gamepad. So I guess it’s technically only a typing game, but it’s also not a traditional typing game at all. Trust me, it makes perfect sense in practice.\ns.p.l.i.t comes from Unsorted Horror and Buckshot Roulette developer Mike Klubnika, and it features his signature layers of grit, retro hardware and purely concentrated nightmares. In s.p.l.i.t, you’re seated at a ’90s-style computer terminal in a cramped, gray-washed shack. The world appears in PS2-era 3D graphics, and you’re surrounded by distended black screens crawling with orange monospaced text. To your left, a window looks onto a dense forest. To your right, there’s an electronic device in a lockbox. By pressing Alt and A or D, you’re able to twist your torso to interact with two separate screens: One displays an active IRC channel with your co-conspirators, and the other is where the hacking takes place.\n\nThe narrative unfurls in strings of data logs, file directories, command prompts and instant messages, while a bed of ambient industrial music pulses in hypnotic waves. You’re attempting to gain root access to a facility where mysterious but clearly unethical things are taking place, and you’re working with two colleagues, Sarah and Viktor, to infiltrate the systems. Sarah and Vikor’s messages automatically appear in the chat box, each one accompanied by a satisfying bloop sound, and when it’s your time to respond the SEND button flashes once, prompting you to type. It doesn’t matter which keys you press while chatting, as lines of pre-written dialogue will appear to push the narrative along smoothly. Sarah, Viktor and the player character, Axel, have distinct personalities and they clash in believable ways. The game does a fantastic job of building robust characters in such a short time, through dialogue alone.\nOn the hacking side, it very much matters which keys you press. You are in full control of the typing while digging through the facility’s files, so spacing, capitalization, punctuation and spelling are all taken into account, alongside use of the proper commands. This portion of the game is a maze of directories and data, operating as one big logic puzzle. Your colleagues outline the goals but once you’re in the system, you’re on your own, relying on context clues to figure out what information you need and how to gain access. The hacking riddles in s.p.l.i.t are perfectly complex, requiring failure and tenacity to work out, and this balance makes each victory feel like a real accomplishment.\nMike Klubnika\nTyping “help” at any time pulls up a list of all possible commands, and I found this screen useful whenever I hit a dead end in my investigations — it’s a natural way to mentally reset and visualize any unexplored paths. The “print” command functions as a notepad, allowing you to save relevant numbers and other information on a strip of paper attached to the PC screen, and it’s a useful tool especially in the game’s later stages.\nI’m no coder, but I got used to the keyboard style of navigation really quickly. There’s a strong sense of internal logic in s.p.l.i.t and it’s satisfying to play in this sandbox, learning the game’s language and steadily building skills as the narrative tension grows. The first-person interface, rhythmic electronic soundtrack and consistent characters combine to make s.p.l.i.t an incredibly immersive experience. It all pays off in a massive way by the end, when the typing game returns and things really get gruesome.\ns.p.l.i.t tests critical-thinking skills and keyboard proficiency in a dystopian near-future setting, and it’s a uniquely unnerving, heart-pounding slice of interactive psychological horror. It’s no more than a few hours long, but it’s something you’ll think about for days after the credits roll, guaranteed. s.p.l.i.t is available now on Steam for just $2.50 through July 31, and $3 after that.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/if-you-have-90-minutes-to-spare-play-the-cyberpunk-horror-game-split-120033911.html?src=rss",
    "full_text": "s.p.l.i.t is the most badass typing game I’ve ever played. It’s actually more of a hacking simulator, cyberpunk thriller and puzzle experience than a typing game, but its core loop is bookended by sequences of high-intensity letter pecking with gruesome consequences — think Mavis Beacon as designed by Ted Kaczynski — and the final scenes have a way of searing themselves into your psyche. The world appears in PS2-era 3D graphics, and you’re surrounded by distended black screens crawling with orange monospaced text. To your right, there’s an electronic device in a lockbox. By pressing Alt and A or D, you’re able to twist your torso to interact with two separate screens: One displays an active IRC channel with your co-conspirators, and the other is where the hacking takes place. It doesn’t matter which keys you press while chatting, as lines of pre-written dialogue will appear to push the narrative along smoothly. On the hacking side, it very much matters which keys you press. The hacking riddles in s.p.l.i.t are perfectly complex, requiring failure and tenacity to work out, and this balance makes each victory feel like a real accomplishment. The “print” command functions as a notepad, allowing you to save relevant numbers and other information on a strip of paper attached to the PC screen, and it’s a useful tool especially in the game’s later stages. The first-person interface, rhythmic electronic soundtrack and consistent characters combine to make s.p.l.i.t an incredibly immersive experience."
