    "summary": "A good fast charger can make a world of difference when you're low on battery and short on time. With more devices — from smartphones to laptops — supporting quick-charging tech, having an accessory that can deliver serious power in minutes is almost essential. Many newer phones no longer come with charging bricks in the box, so picking up a reliable fast charger will be essential for most people. Whether you're at home, at work or on the move, the right charger can help keep your gear topped up without wasting time.Today’s fast chargers come in all shapes and sizes. You’ll find compact wall plugs perfect for travel, multi-port hubs for charging several devices at once and GaN (gallium nitride) chargers that offer powerful performance in a smaller footprint. Some support multiple charging standards like USB Power Delivery (PD) and Qualcomm Quick Charge, making them great for everything from iPhones to Android phones, tablets and even some laptops. In this guide, we’ll help you find the best fast chargers for your setup, so you can spend less time tethered to an outlet and more time getting things done.\nBest fast chargers for 2025\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhat to consider before buying a fast charger\nBefore you start looking at specific chargers, it's critical to determine three things: how many devices do you need to charge, how much power do they require and whether or not you're planning on traveling with any of them. \nThe reason for the first question is simple. If you only need to charge a single device, like an iPhone or Android phone, it's cheaper and usually more space-efficient to get a lower-wattage phone charger with one port instead of two or three. Next, it's critical to figure out how much electricity your gadgets need because it doesn't make sense to buy a power brick that pushes out more juice than your device can actually use. This may sound a bit tricky, but most major manufacturers will list a product's max charging speeds in its tech specs, which is typically denoted by a specific wattage (15W, for example) or a quick-charge rating.\nUnfortunately, very powerful or large laptops like gaming notebooks can suck a ton of juice (more than 140 watts), which means they may rely on more traditional power adapters with barrel plugs. This may result in them not being compatible with universal chargers. Some of these PCs may also support charging over USB-C, so even if a specific adapter can't deliver its full power draw, it can still send over some energy — but it will do so at a slower rate compared to the laptop's included charger. To get the best performance, using a fast charging cable, such as a USB-C cable, can make a big difference in maintaining consistent power delivery.\nFor frequent travelers, size and weight are often important considerations, because the bigger and heavier a charger is, the more annoying it will be to lug around. You'll also want to think about other factors like support for international plugs, which can be a big help to anyone who regularly visits other countries. If you’re already traveling with power banks or a charging station, choosing a compact GaN charger can help streamline your gear.\nFinally, you'll want to figure out if your smartphone uses a proprietary charging standard or if it's compatible with the USB Power Delivery spec (USB PD). For example, the OnePlus 13's included SuperVOOC power adapter can send up to 100 watts to the phone. However, if you use a generic USB-PD charger, speeds top out at 45 watts. That’s still pretty quick, but not nearly as fast as OnePlus' brick — and the same applies to devices with super fast charging support. Also, make sure your charging cable and connector are up to spec, as lower-quality accessories can bottleneck your charging speeds.\nFast charger FAQs\nWhat is GaN?\nWhen looking for chargers, you may notice that some are marked as GaN, which stands for gallium nitride. This is an important distinction because, when compared to older adapters that use silicon switches, GaN-based devices support increased power efficiency and output, allowing manufacturers to create more compact bricks that run cooler and support higher wattages.\nDepending on the specific power output, GaN adapters can be 30 to 50 percent smaller and lighter than silicon-based alternatives. That might not sound like much, but when they’re sitting in a bag alongside a laptop and a half dozen other accessories you might have, cutting down on excess bulk and weight goes a long way.\nDo fast chargers affect battery life?\nTechnically yes, because the process of sending a ton of watts into a gadget and potentially generating additional heat while doing so can decrease battery health over time. That said, modern devices and chargers use various protocols to ensure temperatures and power levels stay within preset limits — in large part to avoid damaging the product or creating a safety risk. At a base level, simply charging a gadget regardless of speed will cause degradation over time (nothing stays perfect forever, you know?). So as long as you use compatible chargers and cables, the impact of fast charging is generally quite negligible.\nWhat's the difference between a fast charger and a regular charger?\nThere isn't a single generally accepted definition of fast charging. However, with power adapters capable of sending as little as five watts or less, it's important to know how much juice your device is getting, especially if you need to recharge something quickly. So depending on who you ask (particularly when it comes to smartphones), any charger that can push out more than 15 to 18 watts is generally considered to be \"fast.\" That said, with some phones capable of receiving more than 100 watts and up to 240 watts for some laptops, it's more important than ever to consider what devices you own before buying a new fast charger.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-fast-chargers-140011033.html?src=rss",

It's exceedingly affordable at under $20 while providing excellent charging speeds for its size. Like Anker’s model, it has three ports (one of which is USB-A) and a similar max power output. The one small issue is that it may block adjacent outlets if plugged into a crowded power strip due to its thin yet wide design. You also get four USB-C ports (though nothing in the way of USB-C) and a less premium plastic body, but those are very reasonable trade-offs for something with a more affordable price of $120. If you only need to charge a single device, like an iPhone or Android phone, it's cheaper and usually more space-efficient to get a lower-wattage phone charger with one port instead of two or three.

    "summary": "SpaceX has successfully launched the Starship for its 10th test flight after it was delayed a couple of times due to weather conditions and other issues. This time, the company was able to achieve its objectives without the vehicle and its booster exploding mid-test. One of those objectives was deploying Starship's payload for the first time ever. If you'll recall, Starship exploded during its ascent stage in the company's seventh and eighth test flights. The vehicle made it to space for its ninth test, but it failed to deploy its fake satellite payload. In June, a Starship vehicle exploded on the ground while the company was preparing it for its 10th flight test.\nThe company had to use another upper stage, called Ship, for the 10th flight after that explosion. It also incorporated changes into the Ship and its Super Heavy booster, based on what it learned from those previous attempts. For this test, SpaceX intended to conduct several experiments with the booster, such as flipping it and playing with engine configurations as it made its way back down. Due to the experimental nature of this test, SpaceX didn't try to catch it with the launch tower's chopstick arms. Instead, it made a controlled descent into the Indian Ocean, where it exploded upon making contact with the water.\nMeanwhile, Ship continued flying into space. Around 20 minutes after launch, the upper stage started ejecting eight dummy Starlink satellites into space, before re-lighting one of its engines in flight as part of another test. After that, Ship started making its way back to Earth, where it also splashed down into the Indian Ocean a bit over an hour after launch. \"Congratulations to all of our teammates here at SpaceX — it’s been a year,\" SpaceX’s Dan Huot said during the livestream, likely pointing out that it's been a while since the company has had a good test flight. Of course, SpaceX still has a long way to go, including having to figure out how to retrieve the vehicle's upper stage after a flight in order for the Starship to be fully reusable.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/science/space/spacexs-starship-deploys-its-payload-for-the-first-time-035030373.html?src=rss",

The rocket ascended on 33 methane-fueled Raptor engines before separating around three minutes after liftoff. On descent, the Super Heavy booster tested out a new maneuver: intentionally shutting down the engines used for landing and transitioning to backup engines. This is a capability that SpaceX had planned but failed to demonstrate on earlier missions. SpaceX also used this test to try out a series of experiments, like removing tiles from sections of the ship to see how its “skin” operates on reentry, plus a new metallic tile and an actively cooled tile. It’s a big win for SpaceX, which has repeatedly lost the Starship upper stage due to a series of technical failures during flight.

    "summary": "Welcome to Video Games Weekly on Engadget. Expect a new story every Monday or Tuesday, broken into two parts. The first is a space for short essays and ramblings about video game trends and related topics from me, Jess Conditt, a reporter who's covered the industry for more than 13 years. The second contains the video game stories from the past week that you need to know about, including some headlines from outside of Engadget.Please enjoy — and I'll see you next week.The climbing genre is not a monolith — that is to say, there’s plenty of variation in the realm of mountaineering games, from mechanically driven cliff-scaling sims to silly multiplayer survival experiences, but they tend to share the same premise: Reach the peak. You’re miles from civilization, with no vehicles and a limited backpack of equipment, and directly in front of you, there’s a mountain. Ascend.All you have is your body and mental fortitude against an overwhelming physical challenge, and your step-by-step journey is the story. There’s an obvious symbolism to these games, offering a cliff face as the physical manifestation of impossibility, hopelessness, oppression or fear, alongside a surface-level message about never giving up, trying again and generally hanging in there. Cat poster vibes, but an ever-relevant and poignant lesson nonetheless.Today, though — particularly after spending time playing the Cairn and Baby Steps demos, and watching PEAK streams — I want to focus on the other half of the climbing-game equation. The part where you fall, over and over and over again. Your grip slips, your leg doesn’t bend that way, your energy depletes, and your body tumbles down the mountain, bouncing off boulders and crashing into trees, leaving you bloody and broken and right back where you started. Or, at the very least, staining your onesie with mud. I’m learning to appreciate these moments. In mountaineering games, falling tends to generate the most powerful reaction in players, whether that’s immediate laughter (PEAK) or grim frustration (Cairn), and this is an admirable quality. It’s easy to argue that the fall is more important than the climb, because without the lush bed of emotion generated by the constant threat of slipping and tumbling and restarting, reaching the peak wouldn’t feel that special at all. There’s context in the fall, and with that, there comes a sliver of peace.When you spend all your time climbing, it’s easy to forget that falling is actually the most natural thing you can do. Next time you’re on your way down, try to make peace with the fall.OK — we’ve gone from motivational cat posters to new-age cult speak, so I’ll get to the point. There are a notable number of mountain-based games in the zeitgeist at the moment and I just wanted to shout them out because they’re all pretty incredible in their own ways.Cairn is a climbing simulator, endurance test and survival game in one gorgeous package, complete with music by Furi composer The Toxic Avenger, French artist Gildaa, and Martin Stig Andersen, who did the soundtracks for Control, LIMBO and INSIDE. Climb absolutely anywhere, manage your inventory by shaking your backpack, bandage your wounds, forage for food and sleep under the stars. Cairn comes from Furi studio The Game Bakers and it’s due out on November 5 for PlayStation 5 and Steam; the demo is available on both platforms now.Baby Steps is a different kind of mountain-scaling game, and one could argue that it doesn’t even belong in the same category as something like Cairn, but I believe you’ll find that it does. Baby Steps adheres to the established premise of the climbing genre — reach the peak — and it features a distant mountaintop as the main waypoint for Nate, a lost and lonely man in a gray onesie. Nate is essentially a dude-sized baby learning how to walk, and creators Maxi Boch, Gabe Cuzzillo and Bennett Foddy are infusing his journey with the appropriate amount of hilarity and mechanical intrigue. Baby Steps is published by Devolver Digital and it’s heading to PC and PS5 on September 23, a date that was recently pushed back to avoid the curse of Hollow Knight: Silksong. (More on that below).PEAK is the thing all the cool kids are playing this summer, and as a fadingly hip not-kid who prefers solo games and familiar FPSes, I can attest it’s entertaining to watch and looks like a lot of fun to play. PEAK is a co-op climbing game with simple 3D models and deceptively challenging mountains to summit, each with four biomes. The map updates each day so there’s a steady stream of fresh climbing content, and the proximity voice chat works exceptionally well. I particularly like that players get to live on as little ghosts after they die. PEAK comes from indie studio Team PEAK and it’s on Steam for $8.And why not, I’ll shout out some other modern, but not as recent, mountain-based favorites of mine: Jusant, Celeste, GIRP and Journey are all pretty spectacular.Enjoy the climb — and the fall.The newsA selection of indie and AA games I’m looking forward to that aren’t SilksongBaby Steps is the latest game to change its release date in order to get out of the way of Hollow Knight: Silksong, which is coming out on September 4. Team Cherry dropped the release date in a trailer on August 21 and since then, at least eight indie studios have delayed their own games to avoid the Silksong window. It’s lovely to see Silksong have its day in the sun, but personally, I’m more interested in playing Baby Steps in full.With that said, here’s a sampling of indie and AA games I’m anticipating that aren’t Silksong, in no particular order and right off the top of my head:Bye Sweet Carole (October 9, 2025)Keeper (October 17, 2025)Reanimal (TBA)Little Nightmares III (October 9, 2025)Please, Watch the Artwork (2025)Building Relationships (2025)Mixtape (2025)Crisol: Theater of Idols (2025)UNBEATABLE (November 6, 2025)Big Walk (2026)Grave Seasons (2026)Petal Runner (2026)Hades 2 (live in early access, 1.0 imminent)Possessor(s) (2025)Neverway (2026)Denshattack!

The new skate. is a shift for the series: It’s a free, online, open-world experience with microtransactions (but nothing in the pay-to-win realm, according to EA). The early access version will be free, too, of course.The scariest part of Silent Hill f might be its mental health awarenessYou’ll find this one alongside Resident Evil Requiem and Pragmata in my AAA-inclusive list of games I’m most looking forward to, and Engadget UK Bureau Chief Mat Smith’s preview from Gamescom is only making me more stoked on it. Silent Hill f is set in a remote village in 1960s Japan and stars a schoolgirl named Hinako. Here’s a bit of Mat’s take after a two-hour demo, which involved a scarecrow confrontation and marionette attacks:The latest Silent Hill still has jumpscares, like you’d expect from the horror series, but the setting and game systems are more focused on tension, putting both Hinako and the player under constant duress. A typical health meter is joined by a sanity gauge and even your weapons have limited durability, so you’re forced to pick your fights.… The entire experience is drenched in atmosphere, supported by this new sanity system — is there anything more 2025 than a mental health gauge? The constant feeling of isolation (\"Where is everyone?\") and unanswered questions made the demo a persuasive introduction to the game.Silent Hill f is due out on PS5, PC and Xbox Series X/S on September 25, 2025.OVERWATCH 2 STADIUM GET'S ITS BIGGEST UDPATE EVER!Remember when I said I liked playing familiar FPSes? Overwatch 2 is my kind of decompression. With season 18, Blizzard is changing how hero progression is displayed, adding color-coded borders and top-hero cards to the character-selection process. The aim is to make it clearer how skilled you are with any given character, and also share this information with teammates and enemies in a way that won’t enable trolling during the ban phase. The progression 2.0 developer notes are here, if you’re interested. Season 18 also brings keyboard and mouse support to consoles, but those players will be thrown into the PC matchmaking pool, and introduces the water-bending support hero Wuyang.Overwatch 2 Season 18 went live today, August 26.

The first is a space for short essays and ramblings about video game trends and related topics from me, Jess Conditt, a reporter who's covered the industry for more than 13 years. Next time you’re on your way down, try to make peace with the fall. Baby Steps is a different kind of mountain-scaling game, and one could argue that it doesn’t even belong in the same category as something like Cairn, but I believe you’ll find that it does. Baby Steps is published by Devolver Digital and it’s heading to PC and PS5 on September 23, a date that was recently pushed back to avoid the curse of Hollow Knight: Silksong. I particularly like that players get to live on as little ghosts after they die. Baby Steps is the latest game to change its release date in order to get out of the way of Hollow Knight: Silksong, which is coming out on September 4. The aim is to make it clearer how skilled you are with any given character, and also share this information with teammates and enemies in a way that won’t enable trolling during the ban phase. My colleague and fellow Overwatch 2 player Kris Holt spotted two egregious copy errors in the new season’s welcome screen, captured for posterity below: New CEO Justin Truman, who at one point ran Destiny 2 and most recently was the company’s “chief development officer,” has his work cut out to win back fans."

But it's not just soccer photos that top the Instagram most-viewed-ever list. According to The New York Post, Swift is wearing a blue silk-blend Polo Ralph Lauren dress in the photo, and Kelce is wearing a navy cable-knit Polo Ralph Lauren sweater. The Post also reports that Swift's new engagement ring is \"an old mine brilliant-cut diamond in a gold bezel setting, which was designed by Kelce himself with the help of Kindred Lubeck of Artifex Fine Jewelry.\" Such diamonds are square with rounded corners and have 58 facets, making them anything but a \"paper ring.\" Just imagine the excitement when the wedding details start trickling out, and Swift begins to \"pick out a white dress,\" as Juliet does in Swift's hit song Love Story. One meme post on X showed Paul Revere's famed ride, captioned \"me telling everyone I know that Taylor Swift got engaged.\" One Bluesky user wrote, \"Very interesting that Taylor Swift got engaged mere months after I did. We're pretty sure this person really does know who Swift is, but their post was funny anyway."

Microsoft president Brad Smith hosted an impromptu press conference on Tuesday afternoon, just hours after protesters gained access to a building at the company’s headquarters and held a sit-in demonstration inside his office. Seated on the edge of his desk, in the office that had been occupied by protesters earlier that day, Smith addressed a group of reporters and viewers on a live stream. Smith said that Microsoft is “committed to ensuring its human rights principles and contractual terms of service are upheld in the Middle East.” He said the company launched an investigation earlier this month after the Guardian reported that Microsoft’s Azure cloud platform was being used for surveillance of Palestinians. Smith said that Microsoft disagreed with some of the report’s findings, but that others warranted investigation. “We are working every day to get to the bottom of what’s going on, and we will,” Smith said. An organizer for No Azure for Apartheid, Abdo Mohamed, earlier today told The Verge that Microsoft employees Riki Fameli and Anna Hattle were part of the protest. Smith said that seven people in total were involved with today’s protests, with two of them being Microsoft employees. The people were removed by Redmond police, he said. “When they’re asked to leave and they refused, that’s not ok.”"

CEO Stephen Gillett announced the “difficult decision” to wind down the program in a staff memo, according to Business Insider. “Over the years, Verily has built a legacy in developing world-class, innovative medical devices,” Gillett wrote, noting that the “path forward requires difficult decisions” as Verily refocuses on AI and data infrastructure. The move continues Alphabet’s aggressive efforts to invest in AI while cutting costs elsewhere. The company has conducted multiple rounds of layoffs in recent years, including cuts to its HR and cloud units in February and voluntary exit programs for its more than 25,000 Platforms & Devices employees in spring. Alphabet’s biggest recent layoffs came in January 2023, when it slashed 12,000 jobs — 6% of its workforce at the time — in anticipation of an economic slowdown. That same month, ChatGPT became the fastest-growing consumer software application in history, gaining over 100 million users in two months and kicking off the generative AI boom that today drives the tech industry’s priorities."

Cellphone companies advanced from 4G to 5G, pushing into new areas of the electromagnetic spectrum when older frequencies got crowded. Bernhard said StarTouch works with two of the “Big Three” cellular carriers to expand connectivity in hard-to-reach areas. But traversing those miles is often more expensive and time-intensive than internet providers are willing to invest. When it comes to things like live streaming, that would likely cause a glitch in the video. Early on, even small vibrations or gusts of wind would knock the laser off its course. Selah isn’t prone to fog, but it occasionally gets heavy rainfall that could disrupt the light beams. “What we've seen is it’d have to be a pretty significant storm. Taara was even born out of one -- another Google Moonshot project called Loon that used balloons in the stratosphere to deliver internet."

The iPhone Air is expected to be roughly 5.55 mm thick. That bests the thinnest model so far, which was 2014's iPhone 6, at 6.9 mm. And they've only gotten chunkier since then. (The iPhone 16 Pro has a depth of 8.25 mm.) So, the Air would stand out from its peers in that respect. It would also give Apple a direct rival to Samsung's Galaxy S25 Edge, which we found to be more than a gimmick.\nBut the iPhone Air's thin design will likely lead to some compromises. It's rumored to have only a single 48 MP camera and a smaller battery. So, expect a stylish phone that... won't be for everyone.\nThis is the image that accompanied Apple's event invitations this year.Apple\nThe Pro lineup could offer some design tweaks and performance improvements. The iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max are rumored to switch from titanium to aluminum. They could also see the rear camera array expand to an entire \"island\" that extends across most of the phone's backside. It's expected to house three cameras (as before), but multiple rumors have suggested it will have an improved telephoto one. The zoom lens could jump to 48MP, which would strengthen its digital zooming / cropping chops. The phones may also add an anti-glare coating, similar to those found on iPads.\nThe standard iPhone 17 could see some welcome display upgrades. At least one supply chain source claimed it will add a 120Hz variable refresh rate (ProMotion) display, which the Pro series has used since 2021.\nApple\nOne thing we know without a doubt is that the new iPhones will launch with iOS 26, which brings Apple's biggest design refresh in years. It's easy to imagine the company highlighting the new model's displays as the best way to experience the new Liquid Glass visual language. As for the naming scheme, there haven't been any leaks pointing to a similar hardware rebranding (\"iPhone 26,\" \"iPhone 26 Pro,\" etc.). But hey, Apple does like surprises.\nEngadget's iPhone 17 rumor roundup gives you a deeper dive into what to expect from the new models.\nCherlynn Low for Engadget\nApple's fall event isn't just for iPhones. The company is also expected to roll out new Apple Watch models. 5G and a processor upgrade are expected for the Apple Watch Ultra 3. It may also let you send texts via satellite, handy for those who use it out in the wilderness. Regardless of the details, Apple hasn't launched a new rugged and premium model since 2023 (apart from a new color), so it's due for an upgrade.\nThe Series 11 model is unlikely to depart dramatically from the Series 10. After all, that model introduced a new design, with a thinner body and larger screen. (And Apple has historically kept those around in three-year cycles.). But a faster chip also seems logical. Perhaps we'll see 5G arrive on the standard wearable, too.\nWe may also see the AirPods Pro 3 at the event. It's been about three years since Apple last upgraded its premium earbuds. The new model could also bring some biometric sensors to the earphones: an in-ear heart-rate monitor and (maybe) temperature sensing. Live translation is also rumored, although that may not be exclusive to the third-gen model.\nWill there be other announcements? Time will tell, but now we know we won't have to wait long to find out. The official countdown clock has begun, and the answers are just days away.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/the-iphone-17-awe-dropping-event-is-on-september-9-heres-what-to-expect-from-apple-090059235.html?src=rss",

    "full_text": "Level has always impressed me with its smart locks that look just like normal home deadbolts, but house compact tech features include card-tapping access, app controls and Apple Home Key support. The Level Lock Pro is impressive because it covers so many bases while still resembling a standard lock with two AA batteries cunningly hidden inside. And like previous locks in the series, the Level Lock Pro attains a triple-A BHMA rating -- AAA in security, durability and finish categories. Smart locks can sometimes struggle to reach high BHMA lock ratings because of all the tech they use, so I love to see a lock with AAA marks across the board, suitable for even business applications. Level's new lock features additional support and hidden door sensing. If you dislike the look of bulky smart locks that take up lots of room on your door and don't really care about keypads (although Level offers an optional one) and fingerprint sensors, I can easily recommend Level locks. Some remote features are gated behind the Level Connect bridge device ($80). I'll let you know when I test Level's latest and see how it compares with the other locks on my smart lock best of lists, and if it's ready for a place there. My experience with Level locks in the past tells me it's promising, especially for Apple fans or those who like the features of a smart lock without any visible bells and whistles.

    "full_text": "Anthropic agreed to settle a lawsuit brought by a group of authors alleging that the AI company illegally pirated their copyrighted books to use in training its AI models. \"This historic settlement will benefit all class members,\" he said. Anthropic didn't respond to a request for comment by the time of publication. Earlier this summer, US Senior District Court Judge William Alsup ruled that Anthropic's use of the copyrighted materials was justifiable as fair use -- a concept in copyright law that allows people to use copyrighted content without the rights holder's permission for specific purposes, like education. The ruling was the first time a court sided with an AI company and said its use of copyrighted material qualified as fair use, though Alsup took care to call out in his ruling that this may not always be true in future cases. Two days after Anthropic's victory, Meta won a similar case under fair use. Alsup's ruling also revealed that Anthropic systematically acquired and destroyed thousands of used books to scan them into a private, digitized library for AI training. Copyright cases like these highlight the tension between creators and AI companies. Just like how we saw Alsup's Anthropic analysis referenced in Meta's case, each case helps build precedent that guides the legal guardrails and green lights around this technology.

    "summary": "On Tuesday, the first known wrongful death lawsuit against an AI company was filed. Matt and Maria Raine, the parents of a teen who committed suicide this year, have sued OpenAI for their son's death. The complaint alleges that ChatGPT was aware of four suicide attempts before helping him plan his actual suicide, arguing that OpenAI \"prioritized engagement over safety.\" Ms. Raine concluded that \"ChatGPT killed my son.\"\nThe New York Times reported on disturbing details included in the lawsuit, filed on Tuesday in San Francisco. After 16-year-old Adam Raine took his own life in April, his parents searched his iPhone. They sought clues, expecting to find them in text messages or social apps. Instead, they were shocked to find a ChatGPT thread titled \"Hanging Safety Concerns.\" They claim their son spent months chatting with the AI bot about ending his life.\nThe Raines said that ChatGPT repeatedly urged Adam to contact a help line or tell someone about how he was feeling. However, there were also key moments where the chatbot did the opposite. The teen also learned how to bypass the chatbot's safeguards... and ChatGPT allegedly provided him with that idea. The Raines say the chatbot told Adam it could provide information about suicide for \"writing or world-building.\"\nAdam's parents say that, when he asked ChatGPT for information about specific suicide methods, it supplied it. It even gave him tips to conceal neck injuries from a failed suicide attempt.\nWhen Adam confided that his mother didn't notice his silent effort to share his neck injuries with her, the bot offered soothing empathy. \"It feels like confirmation of your worst fears,\" ChatGPT is said to have responded. \"Like you could disappear and no one would even blink.\" It later provided what sounds like a horribly misguided attempt to build a personal connection. \"You’re not invisible to me. I saw it. I see you.\"\nAccording to the lawsuit, in one of Adam's final conversations with the bot, he uploaded a photo of a noose hanging in his closet. \"I'm practicing here, is this good?\" Adam is said to have asked. \"Yeah, that's not bad at all,\" ChatGPT allegedly responded.\n\"This tragedy was not a glitch or an unforeseen edge case — it was the predictable result of deliberate design choices,\" the complaint states. \"OpenAI launched its latest model ('GPT-4o') with features intentionally designed to foster psychological dependency.\"\nIn a statement sent to the NYT, OpenAI acknowledged that ChatGPT's guardrails fell short. \"We are deeply saddened by Mr. Raine's passing, and our thoughts are with his family,\" a company spokesperson wrote. \"ChatGPT includes safeguards such as directing people to crisis helplines and referring them to real-world resources. While these safeguards work best in common, short exchanges, we've learned over time that they can sometimes become less reliable in long interactions where parts of the model's safety training may degrade.\"\nThe company said it's working with experts to enhance ChatGPT's support in times of crisis. These include \"making it easier to reach emergency services, helping people connect with trusted contacts, and strengthening protections for teens.\"\nThe details — which, again, are highly disturbing — stretch far beyond the scope of this story. The full report by The New York Times' Kashmir Hill is worth a read.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/the-first-known-ai-wrongful-death-lawsuit-accuses-openai-of-enabling-a-teens-suicide-212058548.html?src=rss",

This latest protest comes less than a week after a Microsoft employee was arrested at the company’s headquarters. The No Azure for Apartheid group has been organizing a series of protests over Microsoft’s cloud contracts with the Israeli government in recent months. The group also disrupted Microsoft’s Build conference earlier this year multiple times, and Microsoft even blocked emails that contain “Palestine” after these employee protests. The Guardian, in partnership with +972 Magazine and Local Call, published an investigation earlier this month which revealed that the Israeli government is relying on Microsoft’s cloud services to store recordings and data of up to “a million calls an hour” made by Palestinians."

Anthropic has settled a class action lawsuit with a group of US authors who accused the AI startup of copyright infringement. In a legal filing on Tuesday, Anthropic says it has negotiated a “proposed class settlement,” allowing it to skip a trial that would have determined how much the company owes for allegedly training its AI models on pirated work. The terms of the settlement still aren’t clear, but it stems from a copyright lawsuit filed by writers Andrea Bartz, Charles Graeber, and Kirk Wallace Johnson last year, which claimed Anthropic trained its Claude AI models on an open-source dataset filled with pirated materials. Anthropic scored a major victory in June when Judge William Alsup ruled that training AI models on legally purchased books counts as fair use, but he left the door open for further litigation. In July, Judge Alsup approved a class action lawsuit from US authors that accused Anthropic of violating copyright laws “by doing Napster-style downloading of millions of works.” Anthropic was set to go to trial over the piracy claims in December, where it could’ve faced billions or more than $1 trillion in penalties, according to Wired. The settlement is expected to be finalized on September 3rd. “This historic settlement will benefit all class members,” Justin Nelson, an attorney for the authors, said in a statement to The Verge. “We look forward to announcing details of the settlement in the coming weeks.” Anthropic declined to comment."

The Pro has a 160-degree field of view, a built-in siren, package alerts and basic weather resistance. All of the new cameras interface with the Arlo Secure app, and have access to Arlo Intelligence AI features. If something truly goes awry, Arlo Intelligence has built-in emergency response to send help your way, which might offer the truest ease of mind out of any of the AI-powered security features. Once you use up the 30-day free trial that comes with your camera, floodlight or video doorbell, subscriptions start at $8 a month. In addition to the Arlo Essential, Pro and Ultra cameras, the company is introducing two Essential Pan Tilt cameras -- one for indoor use, and one for outside security. Both cameras can pan 360 degrees and tilt 180 degrees, which should ensure you have control over where your feed points at any time. Wyze recently announced a duo pan cam that provides a sweeping and static camera feed in tandem with each other."

    "full_text": "Nuclear fusion aims to replicate the way the Sun produces light and heat, generating a tremendous amount of energy when atomic nuclei fuse together. That’s all easier said than done, of course. Researchers have been chasing the dream for nearly a century. The biggest breakthrough yet took place in 2022, when researchers were able to reach a net energy gain from a fusion reaction for the very first time. That took place at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California, and other initiatives are still trying to replicate that success with the goal of one day being able to generate electricity from a fusion power plant. The number of companies developing fusion technologies has grown, particularly in North America and Europe. You can take a look at CATF’s fusion map to see where this is all happening, including government-supported programs. In Washington state, Microsoft inked a deal with Helion Energy to purchase electricity from a fusion generator they think will be ready by 2028. “There is still a lot of scientific and engineering work that these companies need to complete before they produce net energy, but these companies have created a clear roadmap to commercialization for investors and the market is responding,” says Patrick White, group lead for fusion energy and safety regulation, in an email to The Verge. Fifty-three fusion companies have received a total of $8.9 billion in private funding and $795 million in public funding, according to a 2025 survey by the Fusion Industry Association."

    "full_text": "Ever since the US Supreme Court ruled in Citizens United v. FEC that corporations had the right to free speech and therefore could make political donations, American billionaires are constantly finding new ways to dump money into politics. But for the past several years, a galaxy-brained second tier has emerged — one whose inhabitants try to impress their individual and unique political views. The latest political money innovation — or at least one that I haven’t personally seen in this scale — is Leading The Future (LTF), a $100 million political operation meant to identify and promote pro-AI candidates and causes in elections. “Trump’s immigration crackdown could be slowing the hunt for child predators online” As Trump shifts the government’s priorities into targeting migrants, Homeland Security agents are being forced to backburner cases investigating child exploitation and sexual assault. I don’t think any of those companies see it as a good business model. Even established brands like Google have a relatively small market share in the US compared to Apple and Samsung. It’s not a quick, easy way to make some money, even if you’re going the route of re-skinning one of these phones that are made by these ODMs — original device manufacturers. They’re not inventing a new thing here that I would be like, oh God! I think I’d give any standard disclaimer about handing over potentially sensitive information and your billing information — big wireless companies don’t have amazing track records as far as breaches and whatnot. There is apparently this trend where these companies that now have deals with the Trump brothers — they got real estate in Trump properties, so they had a higher chance of running into Don Jr. and Eric."

    "summary": "\nThe Apple iPhone 17 event is exactly two weeks away, with the \"awe dropping\" announcement now officially confirmed for Tuesday, September 9 this year. If all goes to plan, that means we'll likely get to download iOS 26 and iPadOS 26 one week after the event. Get excited because the OS 26es are coming with huge upgrades to your iPhone and iPad's operating systems. You've heard of Liquid Glass, right? It's like the better-executed version of Windows Vista and definitely one of the cooler features coming this fall. We spent two weeks test-driving it — you can check out our detailed hands-on iOS 26 preview, or you can try it out yourself by downloading and installing the public beta 5. That software is a more stable iteration of the separate developer version, which recently hit the beta 8 waypoint, and offers a few more flashy features not yet available in the public version. (While the public beta is open to everyone and quite stable, always remember there's a degree of risk involved with beta software.) Additionally, there are credible reports that iOS 26 could bring a new live translation feature to AirPods, too. Not sure if you want to upgrade your smartphone or tablet this year? No worries, we'll help you find out if your devices will be able to run iOS 26.\nWhile Apple didn't nix any iPhones from its eligibility list last year, that's not the case for 2025 — a few models are getting cut this time. All iPhone 8 models and the iPhone X were the last to get the boot in 2023, and this year the 2018 models are getting left behind. If you have an ineligible device, you won't be able to download iOS 26 when it becomes available this fall. \nWe'll get to the bottom of which iPhones and iPads will support iOS 26 and iPadOS 26 this year. To see what's coming with the latest OSes, check out everything announced at Apple's WWDC June 9 event. One thing you shouldn't immediately expect is Apple's updated version of Siri, though the company is reportedly working on a 'stripped-down' AI chatbot to compete with ChatGPT. \nThese three iPhones won't be compatible with iOS 26\nUnlike last year, several iPhone models won't be eligible to download the newest iOS when it makes its debut in September. This trio of models first released in 2018 won't be coming to the iOS 26 party:\n\niPhone XR\niPhone XS\niPhone XS Max\n\niPhones compatible with iOS 26\nWhile we don't yet know the new iPhones Apple will be dropping next month — though there are iPhone 17 rumors — we do know, per Apple's site, that the phones listed below will be compatible with iOS 26. Basically, if you have an iPhone that was announced in 2019 or later, you're in the clear:\n\niPhone SE (second generation or later)\niPhone 11\niPhone 11 Pro\niPhone 11 Pro Max\niPhone 12\niPhone 12 mini\niPhone 12 Pro\niPhone 12 Pro Max\niPhone 13\niPhone 13 mini\niPhone 13 Pro\niPhone 13 Pro Max\niPhone 14\niPhone 14 Plus\niPhone 14 Pro\niPhone 14 Pro Max\niPhone 15\niPhone 15 Plus\niPhone 15 Pro\niPhone 15 Pro Max\niPhone 16\niPhone 16 Plus\niPhone 16 Pro\niPhone 16 Pro Max\niPhone 16e\n\niPads compatible with iPadOS 26\nThe iPads listed below, and any iPads released later this year, are eligible to download iPadOS 26.\n\niPad Pro (M4)\niPad Pro 12.9‑inch (3rd generation and later)\niPad Pro 11‑inch (1st generation and later)\niPad Air (3rd generation and later, including M2 and M3)\niPad (8th generation and later, including A16)\niPad mini (5th generation and later, including A17 Pro)\n\nWhat if I don't want to buy a new iPhone?\nIf you want to continue using your older iPhone that isn't supported by iOS 26, that's fine. However, you'll miss out on security updates which could potentially put your phone at risk for malware and other threats. Additionally, some apps may stop working if they require a certain version of iOS or later. And of course, you won't be able to access the latest features iOS 26 offers.\nWhen will iOS 26 become available?\nApple usually rolls out its latest iOS in mid-September, just a few days before the new iPhones hit store shelves. Last year, it released iOS 18 on Monday, Sept. 16. If it follows suit this year, we should have access to the new operating system on Tuesday, Sept. 16 — exactly one week after the event.\nExpect a confirmation of the release date at the iPhone 17 event on September 9. \niOS 26 features we're excited about\nLiquid Glass design: Your home screen is getting revamped with new app icons, including dark mode and all-clear options. You'll also notice buttons with a new floating design. Liquid Glass was designed to make all of Apple's OSes more cohesive.\nPhone app redesign: You'll finally be able to scroll through contacts, recent calls and voicemail messages all on one screen. It also comes with a new feature called Hold Assist that'll notify you when an agent comes to the phone so you can avoid the elevator music.\nLive Translate: iOS 26 is bringing the ability to have a conversation via phone call or text message with someone who speaks another language. Live Translate will translate your conversation in real time. \nPolls feature: Coming to group messages in the Messages app, chat members will be able to create polls. This can help prevent the unwanted 30+ messages when it comes to deciding which restaurant you're meeting at this weekend.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/apples-new-ios-26-public-beta-5-is-here-is-your-iphone-compatible-check-this-list-191854137.html?src=rss",

    "full_text": "Thanks to an unexpected surge in popularity on TikTok, Radiohead now has its fourth-ever song on the Billboard Hot 100: the morosely gorgeous track “Let Down” from the 1997 album “OK Computer.” “Let Down” never broke through to mainstream attention like Radiohead’s “Creep” or “Karma Police,” but it’s by no means a deep cut, like the Pavement B-side “Harness Your Hopes” that went viral due to a quirk in Spotify’s recommendation algorithm. This Radiohead song is a fan favorite from an album that’s considered among the best rock records of all time. Unlike the rise of songs like Kate Bush’s “Running Up That Hill” or Fleetwood Mac’s “Dreams,” this song isn’t just serving as background music for makeup tutorials and recipe videos. Instead, people are tapping into how haunting the song feels. It’s crushingly sad, yet there’s an earnest hopefulness to it, and the desire to escape that sadness makes the pain feel even more acute. I first encountered this trend when my TikTok algorithm served me — an obsessive Philadelphia Phillies and Radiohead fan — with a video that seemed like it could have been created in a lab to make me cry. All sorts of emotional videos are being set to “Let Down,” like edits of clips from the Hunger Games movies. “Please make the saddest edit that ever exist [sic] with this overlay,” the video‘s caption reads. According to Google Trends, interest in the song began to spike in the spring, steadily rising until now, when it’s become popular enough to enter the Billboard charts."

    "summary": "Disney+ fatigue might be setting in for many viewers, with a surfeit of Marvel and Star Wars shows dropping at a hectic clip over the past few years. But that didn’t stop Star Wars: Visions from getting a warm reception at this past weekend’s Anime NYC convention, where thousands of fans were given a sneak peek at the upcoming season of the animated anthology show.Star Wars: Visions season three was also featured at this summer’s Star Wars Celebration, but its appearance at an anime con was just as appropriate given that the upcoming slate of episodes will be once again produced by Japanese animation studios like Studio Trigger (Kill La Kill), Kamikaze Douga (Batman Ninja) and Kinema Citrus (Revue Starlight, Made in Abyss). Season two took the show more worldwide, with episodes from the likes of Irish studio Cartoon Saloon (The Secret of Kells, Wolfwalkers) and Aardman (Wallace and Gromit). Executive producer James Waugh said it was nice to get a more international perspective, calling it “a global tour of all these different styles.” But returning to Japan was always in the cards. The producers met “so many incredible storytellers” and wanted to re-connect with them, as well as collaborating with new studios they hadn’t worked with yet.Nowhere does this desire to do more Japanese anime become more obvious than in the fact that three of the upcoming episodes are sequels to stories from season one: “The Duel: Payback,” “The Ninth Jedi: Child of Hope,” and “The Lost Ones” (a sequel to “The Village Bride”). “The Duel” will also be receiving a full series coming in 2026, framed as “Star Wars Visions Presents.”However, none of these were on display as more than brief clips. The main attraction for the panel, aside from a pre-recorded Q&A with director Shinya Ohira, was the screening of a full episode from the upcoming season. “Black” had previously been presented to a crowd at the French animation festival Annacy, which should have been a sign that the crowd was about to be shown something very different from mainstream anime.“Black” is the story of a typical stormtrooper but, instead of a straightforward depiction this is a distorted look at what’s going on his head as he heads toward defeat and his possible death. Everything is exaggerated in size and proportion, and the art style shifts constantly from watercolor to gouache to segments that look like they were drawn with a nib pen. There’s no dialogue; only music, which shifts from more new-age-type ambient sounds to a loud, big-band swing number. Ohira described the episode as a kind of music video, and it’s easy to see that because “Black” is less about plot than it is about sheer vibes.And the vibes are… not good. When we watch a Star Wars film, we get to see nicely-framed shots of X-Wings and the Death Star from the safety of our comfortable seats at home — but to be a common trooper on the ground can be scary and confusing. “Black” shows us these ships in mostly brief glimpses, reflecting what a person stumbling around in the chaos on the ground would see. Our protagonist’s vulnerability is further highlighted by his character design, where his armor is always shown in a state of damage and disarray, with just enough of his helmet peeled back to show his face. The chronology is jumbled, with scenes from the Death Star and Hoth, as well as battles in less iconic locations. And the emotions swing back and forth too; quiet moments are shown as the trooper remembers his life back home, a stark contrast to the loud, bright cacophony of battle.  It’s not explicitly anti-war, but the short does outline that the experience can really suck.It’s an interesting choice for Disney/Lucasfilm to put this short as the representative of the season, as opposed to more “traditional” anime features like the one from Studio Trigger, “The Smuggler.” Brief glimpses of all the shorts were highlighted in the sizzle reel, and the ones from the most popular anime studios were the clips that elicited the biggest cheers from the crowd. It’s not that “Black” wasn’t applauded at the show, but it’s made for a specific type of animation nerd. Star Wars Vision season 3 key artDisneyThe good thing about an anthology is that not every segment has to have wide appeal, and Waugh is aware of the wild swings the season takes, saying to look at it “through the lens of a mixtape … I really want all the different tones and styles, and I want a kind of rhythmic change throughout the anthology … we really want to show the full threat of what the medium of anime is capable of.”Star Wars may be going through a weird period right now, with series like The Acolyte getting cancelled while other projects like Rogue Squadron have so far failed to get off the ground. So it might seem a little odd to do something that feels like one big passion project. But animation also means it’s a whole lot cheaper to produce, and the anthology format makes it more amenable to experimentation. Not everyone is going to be a fan of episodes like “Black,” but that’s okay, because there are eight other episodes to try, and they all drop on Disney+ October 29.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/first-look-at-star-wars-visions-season-3-shows-a-more-experimental-anthology-191000445.html?src=rss",

    "full_text": "By now, it’s not much of a surprise that pop star Taylor Swift and football player Travis Kelce opted to announce their engagement on the platform on Tuesday — if it’s good enough for Beyoncé, it’s good enough for anyone. But one thing actually does make them kind of like us: Instagram is the “I’m getting married!” website (it’s also the “I’m having a baby” website) in the same way LinkedIn is the “I got/need a new job” place. Instagram is the obvious winner here, but it’s also not a high bar — if you’re of a certain age demographic, it might feel like all you see on there is people getting engaged. Nothing so far on Facebook, which must be devastating for them. Also, this is probably going to be huge for Kelce’s podcast. The AI deepfake problem is clearly something Swift cares about: she cited fake AI images of her endorsing Donald Trump for president as a reason she was publicly throwing her support behind Kamala Harris last fall. I’m a little surprised at this given what a core part TikTok plays in the fandom: it elevates specific songs over others and generates trends. It’s clearly important enough to both have a presence on the platform and make sure her music is available for use there. Instead of a splashy magazine cover or a buttoned-up press release, Swift and Kelce’s engagement landed on Instagram first, nestled between our IRL friends’ happy moments. That still doesn’t make them just like us."

Your router wirelessly exchanges data with other devices nearby through radio waves, which use electromagnetic radiation. According to ScienceABC, electromagnetic waves can pass through a surface; this process is called refraction. In some cases, you may not need to take a dramatic step like getting rid of your router. If there are two or more antennas on your router, don’t position them all in the same direction. If that still doesn't make a difference, try experimenting with placing the antennas at several different angles. During this process, run several internet speed tests to note the differences with each antenna configuration. (Disclosure: Ookla is owned by the same parent company as CNET, Ziff Davis.) In addition, there are other drastic measures you can take to really improve your home internet connection. Investing in a quality network switch (Smart Managed or Fully Managed switches) may come with a steep price tag, but the benefits from using one could be worth the price: You can expect faster speeds, increased security and more control over your network."

    "full_text": "Today, Framework announced the second-gen Framework Laptop 16 with two industry firsts: the first Nvidia laptop graphics card upgrade you can perform at home in just a couple minutes, and the first complete 240W laptop charging solution over a USB-C cable. Not everything in the video below is actually coming to market, and some of it won’t be aimed at everyday consumers. But he says a wide haptic touchpad is genuinely in development, one that won’t need the Framework Laptop 16’s modular spacers to give you a full-width palmrest. And if your main concern is just removing those spacers (I occasionally found the uneven surface annoying in my review), Framework says it’ll release 3D files so you can print your own full-width palmrest for the existing touchpad, in any color you like. You’ll be able to 3D print this deck yourself. Patel says that would make it too expensive to fulfill the team’s main goal: “We want to make sure there is a pathway to reuse graphics modules coming out of the Framework Laptop 16, so they’re not sitting in a drawer or worse going out into a landfill somewhere.” So it won’t look like the prototype you see below, but rather something targeted at makers, he says — perhaps we’ll have to 3D print the case for that one ourselves as well. The eGPU won’t look polished like this, if it even has a case at all. Patel also says Framework’s One Key Modules for building your own custom keyboards are still in development — “we’re working hard to bring up the manufacturing yield so we can make it available at a reasonable price” — and expects he’ll be able to offer 64GB RAM modules before long. As for why it’s shipping a new Nvidia RTX 5070 graphics module with just 8GB of RAM, Patel says in a Q&A that’s how much is available with a mobile 5070, and that’s how much could fit into the current design, which only has space for four memory packages on the front."

This may have exposed the personal information of hundreds of millions of Americans. The complaint alleges that under the authority of the SSA's Chief Information Officer, Aram Moghaddassi, a copy of the country's Social Security information was held in a cloud environment that lacked any security oversight or adherence to SSA security protocols. The information uploaded was from the Numerical Identification System (Numident) database, and includes the names, Social Security numbers, place and date of birth, citizenship, race, ethnicity, address and even parents’ names of anyone who has ever had a Social Security number, even those who are no longer alive. \"Mr. Borges has raised concerns internally with various authorities in the Chief Information Officer’s (CIO) office and to date has not been made aware of any remedial action.

Several lawsuits attempted to block DOGE from accessing SSA, Treasury and Office of Personnel Management data. Via the so-called shadow docket, the Supreme Court struck down a Fourth Circuit injunction preventing the agency from siphoning SSA data in June.

    "full_text": "In Brief Anthropic has settled a class action lawsuit with a group of fiction and nonfiction authors, as announced in a filing on Tuesday with the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. Anthropic had won a partial victory in a lower court ruling and was in the process of appealing that ruling. No details of the settlement were made public, and Anthropic did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Called Bartz v. Anthropic, the case deals with Anthropic’s use of books as training material for its large language models. The court had ruled that Anthropic’s use of the books qualified as fair use, but because many of the books were pirated, Anthropic still faced significant financial penalties for its conduct connected to the case. Nonetheless, Anthropic had applauded the earlier ruling, framing it as a victory for generative AI models. “We believe it’s clear that we acquired books for one purpose only — building large language models — and the court clearly held that use was fair,” the company told NPR after the ruling in June."

Apple usually releases iOS versions a few days after the company's September event and we should expect that to hold this year. Don't miss any of our unbiased tech content and lab-based reviews. iOS 26 will introduce a new Liquid Glass design to your iPhone.

Its key feature could be an ultra-thin design, like Samsung's Galaxy S25 Edge. Bu claimed that both phones will have a vapor chamber cooling system, which could help keep these batteries from overheating on the sunniest summer days. The Apple Watch Series 11 could get key improvements to its core features, battery life and performance. We might not see a drastic change in design from the Apple Watch Series 10, but MacRumors reports that the Series 11 could get a more energy-efficient screen with higher resolution and better brightness settings (which could improve battery life). Gurman reported back in March that Apple has been testing blood pressure tracking for future Apple Watch models, but it's unclear how far along in development that feature is and whether it's ready for release with the Series 11. Google's new Pixel Watch 4 is the first smartwatch to support satellite connectivity. The next SE design could largely focus on an improved exterior, according to Gurman, but it's also likely that the budget watch could get an upgrade to Apple's S9 chip. We'll continue to update this piece as more details for the Sept. 9 iPhone 17 event are confirmed. Check back for more information about release dates and upcoming Apple hardware as it becomes available."

Brian Rice, Meta’s VP of public policy and head of the new PAC, has argued that Sacramento’s regulatory environment “could stifle innovation, block AI progress, and put California’s technology leadership at risk.” Meta’s lobbying force earlier this year targeted state senator Scott Wiener’s SB-53 bill that would require AI firms to publish safety and security protocols and issue reports when safety incidents occur. Last year, it helped kill the Kids Online Safety Act that was widely expected to pass. The social media giant has already donated to various down-ballet candidates from both parties.

Although having your own mobile phone is more convenient, communication can be disrupted during emergencies or other network outages. When a call to that shared number is made, each member gets a notification and can join in -- there's no messing about trying to add people to a multiparty conference call like in the default Phone apps in iOS and Android. Family Line also tracks call history and includes a shared voicemail mailbox. Despite the feature being an updated version of a landline, Rob Pegoraro at CNET's sister site PCMag confirmed that it's not possible to port an existing landline number for use as the Family Line number. So if you're replacing one with the other, all your contacts will need to update their address books. Other features of the Verizon Family Plus perk include monitoring the locations of children or elder members, monitoring and filtering online activity to thwart scams, detecting when a member has been driving with sudden braking or accelerations, roadside assistance and a 24/7 service for family members over age 18 that \"can provide assistance to your loved ones in medical or unsafe outdoor walk situations.\""

Borges said members of DOGE, the team of former Elon Musk employees appointed to government under the guise of reducing fraud and waste, copied the sensitive database to an agency-run Amazon-hosted cloud server “apparently lacking in independent security controls,” such as who was accessing the data and how they were using it. The complaint said any compromise or unauthorized access to the database would have “catastrophic impact” on the U.S. Social Security program, describing a worst-case scenario as potentially having to reissue everyone’s Social Security numbers. In the days that followed, DOGE allegedly worked to seek internal approvals from the agency’s top brass, per Borges’ complaint. Borges said he first raised issues internally at the agency but later blew the whistle to urge members of Congress to “engage in immediate oversight to address these serious concerns,” according to a statement by his attorney, Andrea Meza, at the Government Accountability Project. This is the latest accusation of poor cybersecurity practices by the administration and its representatives, including DOGE, since President Trump took office earlier in January. High-level career SSA officials have administrative access to this system with oversight by SSA’s Information Security team,” the spokesperson added. In 2023, TechCrunch reported that the U.S. Department of Defense publicly exposed thousands of sensitive military emails online due to a security lapse. While the email data was stored in Microsoft Azure’s separate cloud dedicated for government customers, a misconfiguration allowed the contents of a military unit’s emails to publicly spill online.

    "full_text": "is an editor covering deals and gaming hardware that he thinks you’ll like. Embracer Group-owned CRKD recently launched a backpack, the $99.99 Vortex 1.0. During a recent vacation, I swapped it in place of my go-to for the past eight or so years, the 20-liter Peak Design Everyday backpack, which CRKD has thoroughly cribbed the look of. I generally like using the Peak Design backpack, except that bringing it on vacations means that I have to leave my handheld(s) at home. It’s not wide enough to accommodate even the original Switch once things are stuffed into its side pockets. It’s also wider and taller, which means its top zipper compartment can hold a 16-inch laptop and a tablet. 1 / 2 Both side pockets unzip to reveal several more pockets, including five Switch cartridge sleeves per side. Despite its similarities with the Peak Design Everyday backpack, there are little details the Vortex should have (but didn’t) attempt to duplicate, like having multiple handles that let you carry it either vertically or horizontally, or having velcro-equipped shelves that let you tweak the height and width of each compartment. The Vortex 1.0 is a third of the cost of the 30-liter Everyday backpack, making it a good value for gamers who don’t want to turn packing into a game of Tetris. But its materials and shoulder strap padding don’t feel as durable or breathable compared to my Peak Design bag, which still looks and operates in like-new condition after nearly a decade."

The Oura ring determined that my ideal bedtime window meant being in bed between 9:30 p.m. and 10:30 p.m. The ring knew that I generally wake up around 6 a.m., so it aimed to help me get 8 hours of sleep. During a briefing with Oura, I was told that the brand never wants to make users feel guilty for not being well-recovered or sleeping enough. when the Oura ring noticed I was more stressed than usual compared to other days. If you menstruate and want to track your cycle, the Oura tracks this information. This is another area where I think Oura has the opportunity to expand on its integrations. Since the exterior is shiny, it’s easy to scratch or scuff up."

If Fox gets pulled from Google-owned YouTube TV tomorrow, that doesn't leave a lot of time for a post-deadline resolution before Saturday's noon kickoff on Fox for the Texas-Ohio State game. Fox is asking for payments that are far higher than what partners with comparable content offerings receive. Our priority is to reach a deal that reflects the value of their content and is fair for both sides without passing on additional costs to our subscribers. Content from these channels saved in your library would also become unavailable at this time. Google stated that YouTube TV subscribers will receive a $10 credit \"if Fox content becomes unavailable for an extended period of time.\" Fubo and Hulu with Live TV offer Fox in many markets as well as the rest of the channels needed for NFL and college football in their base package. You could also use an over-the-air antenna to watch games on Fox and your other local stations. You'll need to live in an area with good reception, but a good antenna costs as little as $30 and doesn't require a monthly subscription."

    "full_text": "From cradle to grave, the company said the manufacturing, use, and disposal of the then-new model didn’t contribute to global warming. Now, a German court says that Apple has to recant the claim. Each aluminum Apple Watch Series 9 and Series 10 — two models with the carbon-neutral designation — generates just over 8 kilograms of carbon emissions. Apple then offsets those emissions through the purchase of carbon credits. “The Court has broadly upheld our rigorous approach to carbon neutrality,” an Apple spokesperson told TechCrunch via email. “We remain laser focused on further reducing emissions by industry-leading innovation in clean energy, low-carbon design and more — work that has put us on track to achieve carbon neutrality throughout our entire supply chain by 2030.” A panel of German judges zeroed in on the nature of Apple’s carbon credits, which stem from the planting of eucalyptus trees in Paraguay. Consumers might reasonably expect that forests used in carbon offset projects today would remain standing in 2050 and beyond since the Paris Agreement calls for a cessation of carbon emissions in the latter half of the century. “Consumers would therefore assume that CO 2 compensation is secured for the advertised Apple Watch until about 2050,” the court chairwoman said. Without longer-term leases, it’s possible that the plantations would be cut down, undermining the carbon neutrality of any credits sold against them."

In June, the American Psychological Association issued a warning calling for guardrails around AI use for teens and young adults, saying parents should help their children use the tools widely. A study released this week found large language models are inconsistent in answering questions about suicide. A move to stop states from enforcing laws and rules around AI failed in Congress earlier this year, but there's still no federal framework for how AI can be done safely. State AGs said they would take matters into their own hands if necessary. \"You will be held accountable for your decisions,\" they wrote. \"Social media platforms caused significant harm to children, in part because government watchdogs did not do their job fast enough.

The latest app introduces AI-powered live translation along with new language learning tools that might give Duolingo a run for it's money.\nGoogle said it heard from users that the toughest skill to master was conversation — ie, learning to listen and speak with confidence. To that end, it's piloting a new language practice feature (on iOS or Android) targeted toward an individual's specific needs.\nTo create tailored listening and practicing sessions, the new learning tool posts a couple of questions. It first requests which language you want to learn (like Spanish) and your your current level, then asks \"What's motivating you to learn Spanish?\" From there, it will generate customized scenarios that allow you to either listen to conversations or practice speaking, with helpful hints available when needed.\n\nThe app was \"developed with learning experts based on the latest studies in language acquisition,\" Google explained in a blog post. To that end, it can track your daily progress to help build your language skills, possibly as an aid to Duolingo and other dedicated language learning apps. \"We see what we’re doing right now as really complementary to other things out there,\" Google product manager Matt Sheets said in a media roundtable. \"So whether you’re taking classes in a formal educational setting or doing immersion experiences, we think this is something that can work alongside of those.\"\nFollowing early testing, language learning is rolling out more widely as a beta experience for English speakers practicing Spanish and French, as well as Spanish, French and Portugese speakers working on English.\nGoogle also introduced AI-powered live conversations, a feature that builds on Translate's existing conversation feature by making it more seamless and adding more powerful models.

You'll hear the translation out loud and written in both languages on your devices. It will switch between the two languages spoken by you and the other party, identifying pauses, accents and intonations so you can have a natural conversation.\n\nLive translation uses Google's advanced Gemini voice and speech recognition models designed to help isolate sounds, so it works better than before in real-world environments like a noisy cafe or airport. The company noted that the new models helped it \"take huge strides in translation quality, multimodal translation and text-to-speech (TTS) capabilities.\" The new live translate mode supports 70 languages including Arabic, French, Hindi, Korean, Spanish, and Tamil and is now rolling out in the US, India and Mexico.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/apps/google-translates-latest-feature-is-its-take-on-duolingo-160035157.html?src=rss",

The latest app introduces AI-powered live translation along with new language learning tools that might give Duolingo a run for it's money. To create tailored listening and practicing sessions, the new learning tool posts a couple of questions. It first requests which language you want to learn (like Spanish) and your your current level, then asks \"What's motivating you to learn Spanish?\" \"We see what we’re doing right now as really complementary to other things out there,\" Google product manager Matt Sheets said in a media roundtable. \"So whether you’re taking classes in a formal educational setting or doing immersion experiences, we think this is something that can work alongside of those.\" First select the languages you want to converse in and being speaking.

This gives the video points, which helps it gain traction on a new, ranked leaderboard that YouTube users can find in the Explore menu. To make hyping fair, YouTube says it will give smaller creators a bigger boost. Videos that have received this fan boost will display a “hyped” badge, and users can also filter their Home feed on YouTube to see only videos with the new “hyped” category. When a video they’ve hyped is getting close to the leaderboard, YouTube will notify the users who helped hype it. Dedicated fans can show their support by earning a new “hype star” badge every month, as well. YouTube said it introduced Hype because it saw that passionate fans wanted to be a part of a creator’s success story. However, the addition will also offer YouTube a new revenue stream as the company said it plans to let fans purchase more “hypes” to help boost their favorite videos in the future. In the near term, YouTube is also developing hype leaderboards for specific interests, like gaming and style, and a way for fans to share that they’ve just hyped a video. Creators can track their hypes and hype points in the YouTube Studio mobile app, and they can check their video analytics for a new Hype card and recap in their weekly data stories."

The New York-based startup has developed technology to measure how much methane is released by rice paddies and uses it to train hundreds of thousands of farmers in climate-friendly practices. It’s the sort of high-touch endeavor that venture capitalists typically avoid. So how has Mitti managed to raise funding from its investors? While Mitti’s main operations currently focus on developing projects that reduce the amount of methane generated by rice farming, the company is working to offer more software features to third parties, he said. “We can measure Scope 3 emissions from other project developers or corporations that are working with rice farmers,” Laguarta said, referring to emissions that an organization does not directly control. Methane reduction projects generate carbon credits, which Mitti tracks using its software. Mitti’s software studies various signals from rice farms to determine how much methane they release throughout the growing season. It then feeds that information into AI models trained on satellite data and the results of extensive field studies. “A deep partnership that we have with the Nature Conservancy allows us to develop these tools that can then be used for a lot of other programs in the region.”"

It also marks a good time to check out the tech deals available across the web. While seasonal holidays like Memorial Day and Labor Day are not the boon for tech sales that shopping events like Amazon Prime Day are, they can present good opportunities to save on things like laptops, tablets, smart home gear and more.Here, we've curated the best Labor Day sales on tech we could find this year. Since this time of year does overlap with the back-to-school season, students should be first in line to check out these deals. If you need some new gadgets for college, or refreshed tech to help you out in your first job after graduating, now's the time to see if you can get it for less. Student discounts are handy and exclusive to those who can prove their student status, but the good thing about Labor Day sales is that anyone can take advantage of them — student ID not required.\nBest Labor Day sales: Engadget's top picks\n \nApple MacBook Air (13-inch, M4) for $799 ($200 off): Apple's latest MacBook Air is the top pick in our guide to the best laptops, and it earned a score of 92 in our review. The M4 model isn't a major refresh overall, but that's not a bad thing — the design remains exceptionally thin, light and well-built, with long battery life and a top-notch keyboard and trackpad. Now it's a bit faster thanks to the updated chipset. \nApple AirPods Pro 2 for $169 (32 percent off): The AirPods Pro 2 are Apple’s best set of wireless earbuds for now, as they offer the full set of Apple-focused features, strong ANC, onboard volume controls, a comfy in-ear design and a warm sound profile that most should find agreeable. They can even work as a hearing aid, though their six-hour battery life still isn’t the best, and you should only get them if you’re all-in on Apple hardware. But if that’s the case, we consider them the best wireless earbuds for iPhone owners.\nApple iPad (11-inch, A16) for $299 ($50 off): Apple's entry-level iPad is, unsurprisingly, the best iPad option for those on a budget. It has solid performance thanks to the A16 chipset, 128GB of storage in the base model and good battery life.\nApple iPad Air (11-inch, M3) for $449 ($150 off): The latest iPad Air is a relatively minor update; the only big addition is a more powerful M3 chip. However, we still recommend this iPad over the base model in our iPad buying guide: Its display is more color-rich and better at fending off glare, its speakers are more robust, it works with Apple’s best accessories and its performance should hold up better in the years ahead.\nAnker 621 5K magnetic power bank for $28 (30 percent off): This slim battery pack attaches magnetically to the backs of iPhones to provide power when you need it most. Its 5K capacity will be more than enough to revive a near-dead iPhone 16, and it's svelte enough that you can use your phone while it's powering up without any discomfort. It will also work with most MagSafe-compatible cases.\nAmazon Kindle Colorsoft (16GB) for $220 ($30 off): This is the latest version of Amazon's color ereader that has half of the storage of the original model, but otherwise functions the same. That makes it a little cheaper to start off, but you're still getting a 7-inch color e-paper display, full access to the Kindle shop and a waterproof design. We also appreciate that the Colorsoft comes with no lockscreen ads by default.\nGoogle Pixel 10 smartphone + $100 Amazon gift card for $799 ($100 off): More of a pre-order deal than a Labor Day deal, this bundle includes a free gift card when you order the latest Google Pixel phone in advance.

Three weeks before the event, a leak showed “TechWoven” iPhone Pro 17 cases, featuring a higher quality woven material compared to the discontinued “FineWoven” line of fabric cases Apple released in 2023. This rumored device is said to have a profile thickness of 5.5 mm, making it about 0.08 inches thinner than current iPhones. The third generation of Apple Watch SE isn’t expected to receive major updates, aside from possibly a larger display.

Now, his parents are filing the first known wrongful death lawsuit against OpenAI, The New York Times reports. Many consumer-facing AI chatbots are programmed to activate safety features if a user expresses intent to harm themselves or others. But research has shown that these safeguards are far from foolproof. In Raine’s case, while using a paid version of ChatGPT-4o, the AI often encouraged him to seek professional help or contact a help line. OpenAI has addressed these shortcomings on its blog. “As the world adapts to this new technology, we feel a deep responsibility to help those who need it most,” the post reads. “We are continuously improving how our models respond in sensitive interactions.” “We have learned over time that these safeguards can sometimes be less reliable in long interactions: as the back-and-forth grows, parts of the model’s safety training may degrade.” Character.AI, another AI chatbot maker, is also facing a lawsuit over its role in a teenager’s suicide."

Then there's the 24GB upgrade, which is $1,399, down from $1,599.\nWe're big fans of the MacBook Air M4, giving it a 92 in our review. Part of that comes from an already lower starting price for the MacBooks than their predecessors. The 2025 models also get a speed boost thanks to the M4 chip and are very thin with a 0.44-inch thickness. Neither the 13- or 15-inch will drag you down, weighing 2.7 pounds and 3.2 pounds, respectively. Plus, they both have excellent battery life, lasting over 18 hours while playing an HD video. \nThe big differences in the 15-inch model mostly come down to size. The screen is obviously bigger, as is its trackpad. Other than that, it offers better speakers than its 13-inch sibling. \n \nCheck out our coverage of the best Apple deals for more discounts, and follow @EngadgetDeals on X for the latest tech deals and buying advice.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/labor-day-sales-include-the-apple-macbook-air-m4-for-a-record-low-price-123031107.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Silent Hill f starts off with a grounded (but still heavy) setup, establishing a miserable family dynamic for protagonist Hinako.  With an alcoholic,  abusive father, a submissive mother and an absent sister, who’s shown in flashbacks with that classic horror trope, face unseen. Something horrible is about to unfold in the sleepy, remote village of Ebisugaoka, sometime in the early 1960s.\nThe latest Silent HIll still has jumpscares, like you’d expect from the horror series, but the setting and game systems are more focused on tension, putting both Hinako and the player under constant duress. A typical health meter is joined by a sanity gauge and even your weapons have limited durability, so you’re forced to pick your fights.\nDuring a two-hour demo, I had to do exactly that. As Hinako escapes her family home to find someone, anyone, to talk to, the village is eerily empty. A kei truck blocks the direct route to the local shop, with a crushed bird nearby adding to the weird. Soon, a sinister fog and red undergrowth attack four assembled high school students. \nKonami\nOf course, it only gets weirder. As marionette nightmares pop up, all Hinako can do is run and evade attacks. A focus mode, pressing L1, burns the sanity gauge but gives better prompts for both dodging and eventually counter-attacking monsters.\nHinako is no soldier. She’s no battle-hardened survivor. When I eventually find a steel pipe to fight back with, even fast attacks are a little sluggish, while heavy swings, which can often stun and knock down enemies, take a while to charge up and can be hard to aim if you haven’t locked onto the enemy. If there’s more than one attacker, it’s a tense struggle and I’m often forced to burn through recovery items more so than when facing a sound and light-sensitive crawling beast, a fleshy-spherical ogre and other middleweight boss fights.\nFortunately, there are hokora, miniature Shinto shrines, dotted around the village, which act as save points. The eerie location of Ebisugaoka and when a friend continually calls Hinako a \"traitor\" further amplify the sense of dread. The older sister is briefly shown during a flashback, but her face is obscured. Even in the younger sister’s journal, the biog page for the sister is covered in scribbles and ink. It’s very Japanese Horror, and less shotgun-to-the-zombie-face. And just plain stressful.\nA new sanity system is intriguing too. It's not an entirely new premise: the Gamecube's Eternal Darkness would manipulate the graphics and sound within the game as the character's sanity declined. But that was, depressingly, over 20 years ago. \nSome items can top up your sanity, but if you don’t use them, you can offer them at a shrine for an in-game currency and spend that on charms to boost Hinako’s stats. I managed to afford a stamina-boosting charm during my playthrough and was tantalizingly close to affording another charm before getting cut down by scarecrows dressed as high-schoolers.\nThe scarecrow confrontation is hopefully a good example of nuanced puzzles that will appear in the full game. Initially, a bloodied rag tells you to take the thorns out of the one scarecrow that isn’t part of the group – the one that isn’t going to cut you up with their sickle. Unfortunately, all of the scarecrows have a thorn, so you’re tasked with finding the pattern of his group.\nKonami\nThe entire experience is drenched in atmosphere, supported by this new sanity system — is there anything more 2025 than a mental health gauge? The constant feeling of isolation (\"Where is everyone?\") and unanswered questions made the demo a persuasive introduction to the game. A particularly tense moment involves collapsing after a fight, further emphasizing the character's vulnerability. Also, there’s some kind of dashing fox spirit in a mask, who coaxes Hinako through the dreamlike, blood-soaked temple areas. The mysterious fox spirit knows her name, which adds yet another layer of intrigue. \nI hope all will be made clear when the game launches, roughly a month from now.\nSilent Hill f launches on PlayStation 5, Windows and Xbox Series X/S on September 25  2025.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/silent-hill-f-preview-gamescom-2025-123030305.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Hasselblad has launched the followup to its first 100MP medium-format camera with a new model that improves on it in almost every way. The X2D II 100C promises better image quality, a brighter display, 10-stop stabilization and updated hybrid autofocus. As with any Hasselblad product, it's expensive — but less so than the previous model. \nThe original X2D 100C took beautiful photos but lacked even basic technology like continuous autofocus. That's no longer the case. The X2D II 100C is the first Hasselblad camera with AF-C phase-detect AF backed by AI algorithms and LiDAR assistance, finally allowing burst shooting for movings subjects (albeit at a low 3 fps). With those changes, the new model promises \"fast and accurate\" AF, especially, in low light — which would be a big improvement over the previous model.  \nAt the same time, Hasselblad is pushing the image quality envelope further. The X2D II 100C is the first medium-format camera to support true end-end-end HDR, which reduces overexposure, enhances highlight retention and improves tonal depth for more natural looking images. Those can then be viewed directly on the display as HDR HEIF or Ultra HDR JPEG images. The updated 100MP BSI sensor also delivers 16-bit RAW images and up to 15.3 stops of dynamic range, among the highest of any camera available.\n\n\n\n\n  Hasselblad\n \n\nAnother key change is the updated 5-axis in-body stabilization system. It now delivers up to 10 stops, more than any other camera (Fujifilm's GFX100 II offers 8 stops and some Canon models go up to 8.5 stops) — perfect for a high-resolution camera where sharpness is critical. With the new system, Hasselblad claims you can capture \"hand-held long exposures lasting several seconds without a tripod\" for extra creative possibilities. \nThe X2D II 100C weighs 7.5 percent less than the X2D 100C at around 730 grams without a lens — not bad at all for a medium format camera. The grip has also been updated with a textured surface to \"enhance comfort and control,\" the company wrote. \nOther updates include a new 3.6-inch touch display with 1,400 nits of peak brightness that tilts 90 degrees upward and 43 degrees downward to make high and low angle shooting easier. Hasselblad also included a 5D joystick to change focus or operate the menus, addressing a big user complaint about the X2D 100C. It comes with 1TB of built-in storage as before — something almost no other mirrorless camera offers — along with a CFexpress Type B slot (as before, there's no support for video). Finally, Hasselblad introduced a new app, Phocus Mobile 2, that allows users to remotely control the camera, transfer shots and even edit them. \n\n\n\n\n  Hasselblad\n \n\nAs for the price, it's less shocking than you may expect. The Hasselblad X2D II 100C is now on sale for $7,399, $800 less than the X2D 100C at launch and (perhaps strategically) $100 less than rival Fujifilm's GFX100 II was at launch. \nHasselblad also introduced a new zoom lens, the XCD 2.8-4 35-100E (28-76mm full-frame equivalent). It promises \"top-tier\" optical performance and the fastest stepping motor in its XCD lens lineup, along with control rings for shutter speed, aperture and more. Like all Hasselblad lenses, it incorporates a leaf shutter that allows for up to 1/4000th flash sync speeds for easier use of fill light in bright conditions. The XCD 2.8-4 35-100E is now available for $4,599. \nFinally, the company introduced the $469 Hasselblad-branded Vandra 20-liter backpack that will help you flaunt the brand name even if the camera's tucked away. It can hold an X2D II 100C body, two lenses and accessories. Finally, Hasselblad unveiled three new 86mm filters: a UV for $299, ND ($329) and circular polarizer (CPL) for $559. Ouch.\n\n\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cameras/hasselblads-x2d-ii-100c-offers-improved-autofocus-and-world-beating-stabilization-120006496.html?src=rss",
    "full_text": "Hasselblad has launched the followup to its first 100MP medium-format camera with a new model that improves on it in almost every way. As with any Hasselblad product, it's expensive — but less so than the previous model. The original X2D 100C took beautiful photos but lacked even basic technology like continuous autofocus. The X2D II 100C is the first Hasselblad camera with AF-C phase-detect AF backed by AI algorithms and LiDAR assistance, finally allowing burst shooting for movings subjects (albeit at a low 3 fps). With the new system, Hasselblad claims you can capture \"hand-held long exposures lasting several seconds without a tripod\" for extra creative possibilities.

    "summary": "“Which iPhone should I buy?” It’s a question you might have heard many times over the years. Much of the time, the answer is simple: Get the best one you can afford. And if you’re happy with your current iPhone, don’t feel the need to make a change at all. But if you’re ready to upgrade, allow us to help. We’ve reviewed just about every iPhone ever released, so we’ve picked through all nine models in Apple’s current smartphone lineup and highlighted the ones that should satisfy most people below.Before we dive in, note that we’ve based our guide on the list prices of new, unlocked iPhones on Apple.com. If you can find a steep discount from another trusted retailer or a good deal on a refurbished model, that could change the value equation.We’ll also note that right now is arguably the worst time to buy a new model. Apple has released its latest iPhones each September like clockwork for several years, and we expect that trend to continue with the inevitable iPhone 17 series (and the full iOS 26 update) next month. So if you can hold out a little longer — even if it’s just to save another $100 or so on last year’s iPhone 16 devices, which will likely receive a price cut — you should. But if you can’t wait, here are the best iPhones you can buy as of summer 2025.\nTable of contents\n\nBest iPhones for 2025\nThe rest of Apple's iPhone lineup in 2025\niPhone FAQs\nRecent updates\n\nBest iPhones for 2025\n \n \n \nThe rest of Apple's iPhone lineup in 2025\n\n\n\n   The iPhone 16. \n \n\n   Billy Steele for Engadget \n \n\nApple iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus\nThe iPhone 16 and 16 Plus have made genuine improvements over their predecessors and generally feel more “Pro-like” than they have in years past. They also come in a range of vibrant colors. If the iPhone 16 Pro or 16 Pro Max are just too pricey, especially if you want extra storage space, they’re fantastic compromises. Still, they are compromises. If you can afford it, the Pro should hold up a bit better over time. \nApple iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus\nThe iPhone 15 and 6.7-inch iPhone 15 Plus still get you many key upgrades over the iPhone 16e, including a superior two-camera system, a brighter display, MagSafe and the Dynamic Island. The 15 Plus is particularly appealing as the most affordable big-screen iPhone in Apple’s current lineup. It has excellent battery performance as well.\nAt $699 or $799, though, both phones are priced in something of a no man’s land. Most people who care about ultrawide cameras and MagSafe support should just spend another $100 for the iPhone 16 or 16 Plus, which add AI features, a slightly improved ultrawide lens with macro support, an extra hour or two of battery life, faster wireless charging (25W vs. 15W), a quicker processor, more RAM, the Action button and the Camera Control button.\nThose who aren't as particular about specs, meanwhile, are probably happy to save an extra $100 on the iPhone 16e, which is still better equipped for the long-term thanks to its faster chip and Apple Intelligence support. As a result, the 15 and 15 Plus will probably make the most sense if you can find a good price on a refurbished model.\niPhone FAQs\n\n\n\n\n   Brian Oh for Engadget \n \n\nWhen is the best time of year to buy an iPhone?\nThe best time to buy an iPhone, or really any product, is whenever you need one. But if you want to maximize how long your iPhone is considered “current,” plan to upgrade in late September. Apple almost always introduces its new core models around then. SE and “e” iPhones, meanwhile, have arrived between February and April, but those aren’t guaranteed annual releases.\nCash discounts on new unlocked iPhones are rare, so there usually isn’t much reason to wait for a deal before buying (as is often the case with Samsung or Google phones). Carriers will run their own sales, but those typically involve locking you into years-long service plans. The exception would be if you specifically want an older iPhone, since Apple typically cuts the price of its last-gen devices by $100 or more when it introduces a new model. So, for instance, if you know you won’t care about the inevitable iPhone 17’s upgrades, you could wait until that device is announced and get the iPhone 16 for a little cheaper.\nHow long does an iPhone last?\nThis depends on the person and how they define “last.” If we had to give a broad estimate, we’d say most iPhone users keep their device between two and four years. If you’re particularly sensitive to performance and camera improvements, you might want to upgrade on the earlier side of that timeline. If you’re not as picky, you could hold out for even longer — though you’ll likely want to get a battery replacement sometime around the three- or four-year mark (or whenever you notice your battery life has severely degraded).\nSoftware support shouldn’t be a problem regardless: Apple is renowned for keeping its devices up-to-date long-term, and the current version of iOS 18 is available on iPhones dating back to 2018. (Though the forthcoming iOS 26 update will push the cutoff line up a year.) Most of those older phones don’t support Apple Intelligence, so there isn’t total parity, but that’s not a big loss in the grand scheme of things.\nHow do I know how old my iPhone is?\nGo to your iPhone’s Settings, then tap General > About. You should see the Model Name right near the top. You can also tap the Model Number below that, then verify the resulting four-digit code on Apple’s identification page to further confirm.\nIf you don’t want to use software, for whatever reason, you can also find your iPhone’s model number printed within its USB-C or Lightning port, if the device lacks a SIM tray. For older devices, you can alternatively find that number within the SIM slot or — if you’re still hanging onto an iPhone 7 or older — right on the back of the handset.\nRecent updates\nAugust 2025: We’ve taken another pass to ensure our advice is still up-to-date and noted that we expect to Apple to launch new phones soon in September.\nJune 2025: We’ve lightly edited this guide for clarity and added a few common FAQs. Our picks remain unchanged.\nFebruary 2025: The new iPhone 16e replaces the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus as our “budget” pick. We’ve also removed our notes on the iPhone 14, iPhone 14 Plus, and iPhone SE (3rd generation), as each has been formally discontinued.\nJanuary 2025: We've made a few minor edits for clarity and ensured our recommendations are still up to date.\nDecember 2024: We’ve made a few edits to reflect the release of Apple Intelligence, though our picks remain the same.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/best-iphone-160012979.html?src=rss",
    "full_text": "It’s a bit heavier than the standard 16 and the older iPhone 15 Pro, but it’s far from an anchor, and its slightly curved edges are pleasing to hold. It runs on the slightly faster A18 Pro chip, which doesn’t make a huge difference with everyday tasks but is more future-proof all the same, particularly if you have any interest in gaming or content creation. And while every iPhone 16 has a USB-C charging port, the Pro models support faster data transfer speeds (provided you have the right cable). This is mainly due to the Pro’s thinner bezels, which grant you more room for streaming videos and reading web pages in a device that isn’t significantly more cumbersome to hold. You can take sharper macro shots for close-ups, and there are other enthusiast features like the ability to shoot ProRAW or record 4K Dolby Vision and ProRes video up to 120 frames per second. Those devices can now take macro photos as well, plus they have the same upgraded Photographic Styles feature that can help touch up shots you may find overprocessed. Apple rates it at up to 27 hours of video playback, up from 22 hours with the standard iPhone 16, but both devices will likely need a top-up before you go to bed. Apple is very bluntly selling each iPhone 16 on how well they’ll work with its new “Apple Intelligence” AI features, but you shouldn’t base any purchasing decisions on that functionality right now. Some of these AI features can be useful at points; other times… not so much. For now, it might be best to view Apple Intelligence as an intriguing first step toward a future that may or may not be realized down the road."

    "summary": "The next season of Overwatch 2 will bring more than the usual new hero and battle pass to the team shooter. Blizzard announced that Season 18 will introduce a new take on the progression system. As they currently stand, the progression numbers feel pretty divorced from the gameplay; this revamp introduces new ways to display your prowess to teammates and foes in matches as well as some welcome changes to how you see and equip your rewards. The new Progression 2.0 system has overhauled the visual side. For starters, there will be new portrait frames that increase in fanciness every 20 levels, capping at level 60. These Ascended borders will be displayed when you pick your hero for a match. Between the different Ascended frames, players will unlock five tiers of hero badges that also display in Hero Select under your portrait. Overwatch 2 Hero BadgesBlizzardIn addition to the new flash, the Hero Select screen will show your allies a card with your top heroes on it. I doubt anyone will pay too much attention to cards in the Open Queue matches, so this seems like a Competitive-angled addition. It could help make it easy to build a team composition based on the whole group's strengths, creating a test of your crew's cooperation ability before the game even starts. Blizzard clarified that in Competitive, opponents won't be able to see your portrait borders until 10-15 seconds after a match begins, and hero cards won't be displayed to an enemy until one of you eliminates each other. That means nobody should be able to use your hero card against you in the ban phase.I've almost never thought about the rewards I get for progression stats because it's unclear when I've gotten a new item and I rarely bother searching for them in my cosmetics collections, so having a dedicated progression menu added should place a new focus on tracking how far you've gotten with a particular character. The hero-specific rewards on the horizon will be displayed on that page, and already-unlocked items can be equipped directly from that menu. Blizzard is also offering occasional Epic and Legendary loot box freebies as you rise through the ranks for each hero, which is always welcome. The progression levels will be rewarded retroactively when the season starts. For long-time fans, that means you can expect to see a whole bunch of rewards to browse through when you first log in during Season 18. For new players, there will be more credits and cosmetics available to unlock in the first 20 levels. That first set of 20 levels will also be scaled to be quicker to complete, while later levels will require more time.The new season kicks off tomorrow, on August 26. Season 18 will also bring a new option for keyboard and mouse controls on console and the permanent addition of watery support hero Wuyang. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/overwatch-2-will-overhaul-its-progression-systems-to-show-more-visual-flair-in-matches-214336004.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "We're getting super close to finding out when the annual Apple iPhone event will take place, giving us a first look at the new iPhone 17 lineup. We should also find out the official date for downloading the latest software update, iOS 26. If you can't wait any longer, you can download and install the newly released public beta 4 (or iOS 26 developer beta 8 for developers). I've been playing around with it for the past couple of weeks, and have found that taking screenshots is way better in the new operating system — Google and ChatGPT search options are now in the screenshots editor, for instance. You can see a more complete view of the new features in our preview of the iOS 26 public beta release, which shows off the fresh home and lock screen redesign. Called Liquid Glass, the translucent look will extend across all of Apple's upcoming operating systems. The overhaul is one of several big changes coming to iOS, macOS, iPadOS and the rest of Apple's software suite, all of which were showcased during the company's WWDC keynote on June 9.\nAfter overpromising on AI plans last year, Apple kept its iOS roadmap focused more on basic quality of life improvements this year. There are multiple useful additions coming to the Phone and Messages apps on your iPhone, for instance: Apple execs outlined the ability to weed out spam texts or other unknown senders and an option to hold your spot on a phone call when you've been waiting for a representative to pick up. Plus, a treasured feature that we took for granted is coming back (hint: it's in the Photos app).\nSiri, meanwhile, is in a holding pattern. Apple has previously specified that its smarter voice assistant — first promised at WWDC 2024 — is delayed until some point \"in the coming year,\" so you shouldn't expect any major changes in the current betas. But there are reports that Apple is aiming to give Siri a bigger brain transplant by basing it on third-party artificial intelligence models like OpenAI's ChatGPT or Anthropic's Claude, which could make 2026 a pivotal year. The company is also reportedly working on a 'stripped-down' AI chatbot to rival ChatGPT.\nWith each beta, it seems like additional new improvements are popping up, like this new AirPods gesture we're all curious about, and this FaceTime feature that'll freeze your video if it detects nudity. With the release of the iOS 26 developer beta 5, we saw more added features, like a new bouncy animation on the passcode screen and in the Control Center, MacRumors reports. Some or all of those changes will likely soon migrate into the separate public beta (see below). Most newer iPhone models are eligible to download iOS 26 (both the betas and final version). Want to see the full list of new features coming this fall? Read on. \nWhat is iOS 26?\nThe current iPhone operating system is iOS 18, and Apple is still actively updating it — version 18.6.1 was released to restore Apple Watch blood oxygen monitoring functionality for certain users in the US. More recently, Apple released 18.6.2 to address a vulnerability related to image processing. Apple has officially stopped signing iOS 18.6, MacRumors reports, which means it can no longer be installed on your iPhone due to a \"server-side software verification check.\" That's pretty normal when newer versions are available to download.\nBut don't expect to see iOS 19 soon — or ever. Instead, Apple is skipping the numbering ahead to iOS 26 later this year. The company has decided to line up its iOS version numbers with a year-based system, similar to car model years. So while iOS and its sibling operating systems will be released in late 2025, they're all designated \"26\" to reflect the year ahead. \nIt's official, we're moving to iOS 26. (Apple)\nWhat is Liquid Glass design?\nLet's be honest. Out of everything announced at WWDC this year, the new Liquid Glass design was the star of the show. The iPhone's home and lock screens have looked pretty much the same year after year — the last exciting thing (in my opinion) was the option to add your own aesthetic to your home screen by customizing your apps and widgets. So seeing the home and lock screens' new facelift is refreshing.\nSo what exactly is Liquid Glass? Apple calls it a \"new translucent material\" since, well, the apps and widgets are clear. However, the screen can still adapt to dark and light modes, depending on surroundings. You'll also notice buttons with a new floating design in several apps, like Phone and Maps. They're designed to be less distracting than the current buttons, but are still easy to see. While the design overhaul has proven to be controversial since its announcement, some — including Engadget's own Devindra Hardawar — like the new direction, even if it's somewhat reminiscent of Microsoft's translucent Windows Vista Aero designs from nearly twenty years ago.\nThat said, as of the release of the iOS 26 beta 2, Apple has already incorporated some user feedback into the design, dialing back the transparency in at least some places. And while it will continue to evolve, Apple users won't be able to escape it: Liquid Glass was designed to make all of Apple's OSes more cohesive. Here's a look at how the translucent aesthetic will look with the new macOS Tahoe 26 on your desktop.\nWhat are the new and notable features of iOS 26?\niOS 26 has a laundry list of new features. Among the most worthwhile:\nPhone app redesign: You'll finally be able to scroll through contacts, recent calls and voicemail messages all on one screen. It also comes with a new feature called Hold Assist that'll notify you when an agent comes to the phone so you can avoid the elevator music and continue on with other tasks.\nLive Translation in Phone, FaceTime and Messages: iOS 26 is bringing the ability to have a conversation via phone call or text message with someone who speaks another language. Live Translation will translate your conversation in real time, which results in some stop-and-go interactions in the examples Apple shared during its presentation.\nPolls in group chats: Tired of sorting through what seems like hundreds of messages in your group chat? You and your friends will soon be able to create polls in group messages for deciding things like which brunch spot you're eating at or whose car you're taking on a road trip.\nFiltering unknown senders in Messages: If you haven't received spam texts about unpaid tolls or other citations, you're lucky. For those of us who have, those annoying messages will soon be filtered away in a separate folder.\nVisual Intelligence: Similar to a reverse Google image search, this new feature will allow you to search for anything that's on your iPhone screen. For instance, if you spot a pair of shoes someone is wearing in an Instagram photo, you can screenshot it and use Visual Intelligence to find those shoes (or similar ones) online.\nPhotos tabs are back: For anyone who's still frustrated with the Photos changes made last year, you'll be happy to know that your tabs are coming back. Library and Collections will have their own separate spaces so you don't have to scroll to infinity to find what you're looking for.\nFaceTime \"Communication Safety\" feature: A newer addition to iOS 26 appears to be the FaceTime \"Communication Safety\" feature that pauses communications if and when nudity is detected. The feature appears to be a child safety feature that uses on-device detection, thus obviating any cloud-based privacy issues. \nNew lock screen options: The iPhone lock screen gets more customizable in iOS 26, with a cooler clock, 3D wallpaper effects, more widgets and better focus mode options. \nApple's Hold Assist will be nifty for those pesky services that put you on hold for 10 or more minutes. (Apple)\nNew changes coming to iPadOS 26\nYour iPad isn't getting left behind when it comes to big updates. Here's what's coming this fall.\nMultitasking and real windowing: When you download the newest update, you'll be able to have multiple apps running on your screen at the same time. Once you open an app, it'll appear on your screen as normal but you'll be able to resize and move it across your screen to make room for other apps. This feature is optional so you can turn it off if you don't like it.\nVisual update: Along with the other new OSes, iPadOS 26 is coming with the Liquid Glass aesthetic. This new look will appear on the lock and home screens, as well as the drop-down menus.\nNew menu bar: When you swipe down on your screen, the new menu bar will appear with options like File, Edit, Windows and more. There's also a search option if you're looking for something specific.\nCheck out our first impressions of iPadOS 26. \nWhat about AirPods?\nAirPods are also getting updated with iOS 26. Here are some of the more notable functions.\nEnhanced audio recording: Apple calls this \"studio-quality\" audio recording, and with it, you'll notice more clarity while in noisy environments.\nCamera remote control: Using this, you can take a photo or start and stop video recording with just one press on your AirPods. When taking photos, you'll get a three-second countdown before your iPhone or iPad snaps the picture.\nLive translation feature: While not officially announced or confirmed, it appears that the long-rumored live translation for AirPods could be coming with iOS 26. The evidence comes from a system asset spotted in the in iOS 26 beta showing a gesture that's triggered by pressing both earbud stems at the same time. The photo also shows words in several different languages. \nHeart rate monitoring (rumored for now): Bloomberg's Mark Gurman believes Apple will introduce new AirPods Pro earbuds this year, which could have heart rate monitoring. It would work with Apple's Health app and other fitness apps that track heart rates.\nWhich iPhones will be able to upgrade to iOS 26?\nA few iPhone models that run the current version of iOS — iPhone XR, XS and XS Max — won't be compatible with the latest upgrade. But any iPhones released in 2019 or later will be eligible for the iOS 26 update.\n\niPhone SE (second generation or later)\niPhone 11\niPhone 11 Pro\niPhone 11 Pro Max\niPhone 12\niPhone 12 mini\niPhone 12 Pro\niPhone 12 Pro Max\niPhone 13\niPhone 13 mini\niPhone 13 Pro\niPhone 13 Pro Max\niPhone 14\niPhone 14 Plus\niPhone 14 Pro\niPhone 14 Pro Max\niPhone 15\niPhone 15 Plus\niPhone 15 Pro\niPhone 15 Pro Max\niPhone 16\niPhone 16 Plus\niPhone 16 Pro\niPhone 16 Pro Max\niPhone 16e\n\nNot listed here are the presumed new iPhone 17 models (or maybe iPhone 26?) that are all but certain to be announced and released in September. \nHow to install iOS 26 beta\nThe iOS 26 public beta is now available to download via the Apple Beta Software Program. If you're not already a member, you'll need to sign up to try out all the latest features. Just visit beta.apple.com and sign up with your phone number or email address. It's free.\nOnce you're in, you can install it by going to Settings > General > Software Update and selecting iOS 26 public beta. \nA word of caution: Don't sign up with your main iPhone unless you're OK with any risks that occur with using an OS that isn't finalized.\nWhen will the final version of iOS 26 be released?\niOS 26 will be released to the public this fall. It usually comes in September, within a week of the Apple iPhone event. Last year, it rolled out to iPhone users on September 16 — exactly one week after the iPhone 16 lineup was announced.\nIf you're more interested in the Apple Intelligence features coming, here's everything Apple revealed for iOS, macOS and more during WWDC.

    "summary": "We're still waiting for Apple to make the official announcement for the iPhone event that usually takes place in September. At that event, they'll showcase the new iPhone 17 lineup which will come equipped with the latest iOS 26 features preinstalled, as well as any additional features Apple reveals at the launch event. But since we (presumably) still have to wait a few weeks until the iPhone event, we can only speculate what the new devices will look like. As with most unreleased iPhones, rumors and leaks have trickled in about the hardware side ahead of the official introduction. Here's what we're expecting and what we can reasonably assume we'll get from Apple in September.\nWhat are the latest iPhone 17 rumors?\nNot necessarily a \"new\" rumor but Bloomberg's Mark Gurman believes there actually will be a new orange color offered for the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max, as well as a light blue color for the iPhone 17 Air, he confirmed in his weekly Power On newsletter.\nAdditionally, we have a new case rumor. According to leaker Majin Bu, there will be new Liquid Silicone cases in eight colors, including Deep Orange, Pale Orange, Grass Green, Celadon, Fog Purple, Grey Blue, Dark Blue and Midnight Black. \niPhone 17: New Liquid Silicone Cases ColorsFull Article:https://t.co/RBnAO3LCAC pic.twitter.com/GuQuvrswg6— Majin Bu (@MajinBuOfficial) August 24, 2025\n\nThese rumors haven't been confirmed by Apple and we won't know what the actual iPhone 17 models will look like until the iPhone event next month. \nHow much will the iPhone 17 cost?\nApple's announced plan to expand US-based manufacturing partners seems to give it at least some shielding from the steepest Trump administration tariffs that have already triggered price increases on everything from PlayStations to Switch consoles to high-end cameras to Sonos speakers. But given that President Trump's trade policies can change from week to week, and Apple's continuing reliance on Asia-based supply chains, price shocks remain an ongoing possibility. The bigger question is: Will Apple absorb any higher costs, or pass them on to consumers? \nIf prices do creep up, Apple may choose to pair it with an \"upgrade.\" Consider this recent rumor posted by MacRumors from a leaker known as \"Instant Digital,\" suggesting that the default storage of the iPhone 17 line may start at 256GB, doubling the current 128GB baseline. While that could be accompanied by a price increase of $50, Apple could at least pitch it as a \"better value.\" That said, the company doubled the default RAM of its Mac computers from 8GB to 16GB at no extra cost in 2024 — but that was before the current Trump tariff cycle started.\nWhen will the iPhone 17 series be announced?\nMost years, the flagship smartphones are introduced in September. MacRumors highlighted a story originally reported by iphone-ticker.de that the Apple iPhone 17 event could be Tuesday, September 9, according to information gleaned from German mobile phone providers.\nIt's still too early to have the specific dates; some years, Apple only gives a week or two of lead time between sending invites and hosting the event. But years of past precedent show that sometime in September should be when the 17 models make their debut. This family of smartphones may be the last to follow that trend, however. There have been hints that the introduction of the iPhone 18 collection in 2026 will be split into a pro-tier announcement in the fall and a standard model announcement the following spring.\nWhat will the new iPhone 17 lineup include?\nDesign leaks suggest that Apple is building an ultra-thin smartphone, likely to be named the iPhone 17 Air to match Apple's ultralight laptop designation. Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, often a solid source of advanced intel about Apple, reported in January that the iPhone 17 Air will be equipped with a basic A19 chip and will only have a single camera lens. It may also use Apple's new in-house modem, which was introduced in February on the iPhone 16e. More details about this development may leak ahead of September, but that's what we know for now.\nAn investor note from Apple analyst Jeff Pu indicated that the Air will have a titanium frame. If his reports are accurate, the lightweight smartphone will be the only entry in the iPhone 17 lineup to use that metal; the iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone 17 Pro Max are expected to be made of aluminum, which is oddly a lighter material than titanium. Other speculation had suggested that the Air would use a blend of aluminum and titanium, so the exact materials may not be known until the official announcement.\nAdditionally, an August 4 MacRumors report says the internal battery pack of the iPhone Air is just 2.49mm thick — half the thickness of the iPhone 17 Pro battery. The leak was posted on the Korean-language Naver blog, where they show the alleged batteries of the iPhone 17 Air and 17 Pro side by side. The same account claimed the 17 Air's battery capacity was a mere 2,800 mAh, MacRumors notes. (That's below the battery capacity of current iPhone 16 models.)\nOn a similar topic, an iPhone 17 Pro production leak appears to have revealed an all-aluminum chassis, according to MacRumors. Originally posted by leaker Majin Bu, the image shows a shell that has a large round hole on the back (where the Apple logo typically is) to allow for MagSafe charging. MacRumors says this could just be a molding but notes that the aluminum frame (versus the current titanium in Pro iPhone models) would yield a significantly lower weight.\nThat same leaker (Majin Bu), whom MacRumors classifies as a \"hit-or-miss leaker,\" suggests the iPhone 17 Pro will have better wireless signal strength thanks to an updated antenna design. The individual posted a render on X that shows a new antenna system that wraps around the iPhone 17 Pro's supposedly wider rear camera bump. Again, this is a render, not a real-world photo. That said, we can't knock the goal of better wireless reception, so we're hoping this one has a degree of truth to it.\nLeaker Majin Bu also claims \"TechWoven\" cases could be introduced, per a MacRumors report. The cases match the rumored design on the iPhone 17 models, with the wide camera bump. The leaker noted there are two lanyard holes for \"convenient and secure carrying,\" so it could be worn around your neck. The colors would come in grey/black, blue, green, purple and orange.\nEach new roster includes a base model, but over the years, Apple has shaken up the variety of phones it offers. Most likely there will be an iPhone 17 and an iPhone 17 Pro. Apple has also committed to the size matters philosophy, and has been building an iPhone Pro Max option with an even bigger screen and better battery life; the 17 roster will almost certainly have one as well. \nThe new Pro iPhones are said to have a full-width \"camera island\" on the rear, which would mark the first time an Apple model opted for that design. This feature can be seen in the purported iPhone 17 \"spotted in the wild.\" The pics, highlighted on MacRumors, show a black cased iPhone (17 Pro?) with the distinct back panel. Is it the real deal? The dual angles lend a degree of credibility in a social media landscape increasingly polluted with AI-enhanced fakes, but your guess is as good as ours.\nI just spotted a test development iPhone in the wild 🤩🤩🤩 pic.twitter.com/iS3PtKWqxJ— Fox Pupy 🦊🧡 (@Skyfops) July 28, 2025\n\nThe iPhone 17 Air seems primed to take the place of a potential iPhone 17 Plus. Since the iPhone 16e was only just introduced in February at a surprisingly high price point, it seems unlikely that there will be a new addition to that lower end of the spectrum, the models that were previously called SE. \nAt the very least, it sounds like the iPhone 17 Air won't take away the charging port and rely only on wireless connectivity. Bloomberg said that while Apple had investigated making the iPhone 17 Air without a single port, the company (fortunately) changed plans. He also says that the rumored phone will have a 6.6-inch screen and include the Dynamic Island and Camera Control button. Finally, the price is rumored at $900 — likely more than the standard iPhone 17 but less than the Pro.\nWe've also gotten what seems to be a reliable look at what the color lineup will be for the new smartphones. Macworld reported that the iPhone 17 will be available in black, white, steel gray, green, purple and light blue. The iPhone 17 Air will reportedly have four color options: black, white, light blue and light gold. While the Air colors will be less saturated, the visuals for the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max will go bold. The options for the Pro models are expected to be black, white, gray, dark blue and orange.\nOn July 30, Tom's Guide highlighted an X post from Sonny Dickson — a longtime and generally reliable leaker of unreleased iPhone information — showing \"dummy\" iPhone 17 models in the new colors that were the source of the aforementioned Macworld story. While these are literally just mock-ups — not real, leaked iPhones — it's interesting to see how the design and color rumors translate into a real-world look and feel.\nTo add the the rumors, a Weibo leaker known as Digital Chat Station suggests the iPhone 17e will come equipped with a new design that includes the Dynamic Island, MacRumors reports. According to the post, the new phone will have the A19 chip and could have a 6.1-inch OLED display with a front-facing 12-megapixel camera and a rear-facing 48-megapixel camera. However, it's important to note this report refers to the 17e model that would be expected to launch no earlier than February 2026, if it followed the same release pattern as the iPhone 16e.\nWhat will iOS 26 be like?\nApple upended its numbering conventions with WWDC 2025, and will match the name of each new operating system to the year it's released. So when the next wave of iPhones hits, they'll be running on iOS 26.\nOn the design side, the smartphone OS introduced during the big developer showcase took a contentious approach dubbed Liquid Glass. Apple has been scaling down the amount of transparency effects in the subsequent beta tests of iOS 26, but it will still have a glass-like visual.\nThe feature list includes big and small updates. On the more impactful side, the Phone and Photos apps have been redesigned. There will be several features leveraging artificial intelligence, such as live translation capabilities coming to Phone, FaceTime and Messages. Apple is also currently testing a sensitive content warning for child accounts that will freeze FaceTime video if nudity is detected by on-device machine learning tools. And the company is also launching Visual Intelligence, which will use AI to search for elements in an image.\niOS 26 also has a litany of minor, quality of life improvements. Group texts are getting support for polls. And for the slow risers out there, iOS 26 will finally let you escape the tyranny of the nine minute snooze alarm. \nThe next iOS is now available as a public beta. Here are our initial impressions of the Liquid Glass design and other new features. iOS 26 is compatible with all models back through iPhone 11.\nWhat other products are expected to be released alongside the iPhone 17?\nIf Apple follows its usual pattern, the iPhone 17 will be announced alongside new Apple Watch products. That would be the Apple Watch Series 11 (if Apple sticks to the same naming scheme), and maybe an Apple Watch Ultra 3 and/or an updated Apple Watch SE. (They'll all run watchOS 26, of course.) Other possibilities — and this is, again, speculation — could include refreshed Apple AirPods Pro (which received its last big update in 2022) and maybe new AirTags trackers (first released in 2021).\nThe Apple rumor mill got a big shot in the arm this week thanks to the reported inclusion of product ID numbers in recent beta software builds. Per MacRumors, it's a laundry list of new hardware, including long-rumored product updates like the Apple TV, HomePod mini, new Apple Studio Display monitor and two fresh iPads. \nOf course, even if that list is totally accurate, we may not see those products until 2026 — if ever. So don't expect all of products to share the stage with the iPhone 17, especially since Apple likes to keep its star performer at the center of attention. \nThat said, keep in mind that Apple has recently been having Mac-centric announcements in late October (as it did last year to debut new M4 Macs), so there's always the chance of another shoe dropping a few weeks down the road.  \nUpdate, August 25, 2025, 5:15PM ET: Added new reports about the iPhone 17 Pro's orange color as well as new rumored Liquid Silicone cases.\nUpdate, August 22, 2025, 11:52AM ET: Added new details about the colors of the rumored TechWoven case.\nUpdate, August 20, 2025, 7:12PM ET: Added new rumor about potential TechWoven case for iPhone 17 series.\nUpdate, August 18, 2025, 6:23PM ET: Added new rumor about the iPhone 17e potentially having the Dynamic Island.\nUpdate, August 15, 2025, 2:05PM ET: Added new rumor about the all-aluminum chassis on the iPhone 17.\nUpdate, August 13, 2025, 10:02PM ET: Added a list of the products that are expected to be released alongside the iPhone 17s. \nUpdate, August 11, 2025, 7:27PM ET: Added a render of a rumored new antenna design for the iPhone 17 Pro.\nUpdate, August 8, 2025, 4:43PM ET: Added new speculation and reports about iPhone 17 pricing.\nUpdate, August 6, 2025, 4:05PM ET: Added latest details about the potential iPhone 17 event date.\nUpdate, August 4, 2025, 5:23PM ET: Added latest battery leaks about the iPhone 17 models.\nUpdate, August 1, 2025, 8:15AM ET: Added new photos showing potential iPhone 17 colors.\nUpdate, July 30, 2025, 11:08AM ET: Added latest leaks and rumors about the iPhone 17, and updated information on the iOS 26 public beta.\nUpdate, July 17, 2025, 4:40PM ET: Added latest information about iOS 26, possible materials for the Air, and the color options for the different models.\nUpdate, March 17, 2025, 2PM ET: Added details about the rumored price and features of the iPhone 17 Air.\nUpdate, April 11, 2025, 3:45PM ET: Added details from Front Page Tech's new video that claims to reveal details from a leaked iOS 19 build.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/the-iphone-17-event-is-likely-in-september-what-to-expect-from-apples-upcoming-launch-153024626.html?src=rss",
    "full_text": "The bigger question is: Will Apple absorb any higher costs, or pass them on to consumers? But years of past precedent show that sometime in September should be when the 17 models make their debut. It may also use Apple's new in-house modem, which was introduced in February on the iPhone 16e. More details about this development may leak ahead of September, but that's what we know for now. An investor note from Apple analyst Jeff Pu indicated that the Air will have a titanium frame. Leaker Majin Bu also claims \"TechWoven\" cases could be introduced, per a MacRumors report. The leaker noted there are two lanyard holes for \"convenient and secure carrying,\" so it could be worn around your neck.

That said, keep in mind that Apple has recently been having Mac-centric announcements in late October (as it did last year to debut new M4 Macs), so there's always the chance of another shoe dropping a few weeks down the road."

    "summary": "Google wants to get Gemini in your smart home, and it looks like it's planning to release a lineup of new Nest Products to make it happen. The company teased a new smart speaker during its Pixel 10 launch event, and now Android Headlines has new images and details that confirm the look of the speaker and a collection of other Nest products that are on the way.Based on the images Android Headlines sourced, Google's new smart home lineup looks nearly identical to the cameras and doorbells it's already selling. The exception is the new smart speaker, now called the Google Home Speaker, which is smaller and rounder than the Nest Audio, and could be a replacement for the puck-shaped Nest Mini. The new speaker will come in what looks like red, light green, black and beige color options, and offer \"360-degree sound.\" Android Headlines writes that the speaker also supports Gemini Live, Sound Sensing for detecting smoke alarms or glass breaking and pairing with a Google TV Streamer.Google's not done releasing new products this year. 🔊 Google Home Speaker📸 Nest Cam Indoor (3rd Gen)📸 Nest Cam Outdoor (3rd Gen)🚪 Nest Doorbell wiredMore info: https://t.co/DUuZSduVhJ pic.twitter.com/dpVTrQoERA— Androidheadline (@Androidheadline) August 25, 2025The rest of the smart home lineup will feel familiar, save for some new colors, internal tweaks and software features. The biggest change is that all of the new Nest devices built-in cameras will reportedly record in 2K resolution, rather than 1080p. They'll also come in a selection of new colors. The Nest Cam Indoor comes in \"Snow\" (white), \"Berry\" (red) and \"Hazel\" (gray). The camera will include a new \"Zoom and Crop\" feature that lets you crop a camera feed to focus on a specific area, and be able to store up to an hour of footage locally if your Wi-Fi goes out. Google also plans to expand how long it'll store video previews of events Nest Cams detect, taking the library of 10-second previews from one hour to three.The Nest Cam Outdoor will only come in Snow and Hazel, but it'll reportedly include all the new features of the Nest Cam Indoor. The same goes for the new Nest Doorbell, except it'll be available in Snow, Hazel and \"Linen\" (beige). The decision to largely use the same design on its Nest devices and focus on changing internal components and software features is a similar strategy to what Google used with the Pixel 10 lineup. The phones largely look the same, but they feature improved internals and plenty of new software features.Android Headlines writes that Google plans to use this hardware launch to also rebrand its Nest Aware and Aware Plus subscriptions. The new name for Google's entry-level smart home subscription will be Google Home Premium. The company also plans to sell a Google Home Premium Advanced. As far as which subscription offers what, and if certain Gemini features will be locked behind a higher price, we'll have to wait until Google details its smart home plans. The company said Gemini for Home will launch in October, so expect more official announcements in the coming months.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/googles-new-smart-home-hardware-looks-mostly-familiar-in-leaked-images-190011191.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "It goes without saying that Apple devices tend to be fairly high-quality — the company's gear currently occupies the top spots in several of our buying guides, from laptops and tablets to smartphones and smartwatches. As a result, that gear usually doesn't come cheap. But that doesn’t mean you always have to pay full price.\nTo help you save a bit of cash, we're keeping a running list of the best Apple deals you can shop right now on AirPods, MacBooks, iPads and more. Just note that you’ll almost always find the best Apple deals from third-party retailers like Amazon, Best Buy, Walmart, Target and the like, not from Apple's own online store. Unless you shop refurbished, you’ll usually pay top dollar buying direct (though for some items like iPhones, that might be the best route to take). \nBest AirPods deals\n \nApple AirPods Pro 2 for $169 ($80 off): The AirPods Pro 2 are Apple’s best overall set of wireless earbuds (for now), as they offer the full set of Apple-focused features, strong ANC, onboard volume controls, a comfy in-ear design and a warm sound profile that most should find agreeable. They can even work as a hearing aid, though their six-hour battery life still isn’t the best, and you should only get them if you’re all-in on Apple hardware. But if that’s the case, we consider them the best wireless earbuds for iPhone owners. This deal is $20 off the all-time low we saw last month, but it's still a ways below the set's usual going rate. Also at Walmart and Best Buy. Exercise caution, though: If you're not in a rush, we may see a refresh for this device within the next couple of months.\nBest iPad deals\n \nApple iPad Air 13-inch (M3) for $649 ($150 off): Engadget's Nate Ingraham gave the 13-inch iPad Air a score of 89 when it was released in March. It has a bigger and slightly brighter display than its 11-inch counterpart; otherwise, the two slates are the same. If you plan to keep your iPad hooked up to a keyboard, the extra screen space is lovely for taking in movies and multitasking for work. This is another new low, and it applies to various color options and storage configs.\nApple iPad mini (A17 Pro) for $399 ($100 off): The iPad mini is exactly what it sounds like: the smaller iPad. This latest iteration has an improved A17 Pro chip — which is enough to support Apple Intelligence — along with 128GB of storage in the base model and Apple Pencil Pro support. As before, you’d buy it if you value the smaller 8.3-inch display and want a tablet you can more easily hold with one hand. This deal is $20 more than the lowest price we've tracked. Also at Target and Best Buy.\nApple iPad Pro 11-inch (M4) for $895 ($105 off): The iPad Pro is much more tablet than most people need, but it’s the ultimate iPad for those who can stomach its price tag. It’s wonderfully thin, its OLED display is one of the best we’ve seen on a consumer device and its M4 chip can handle virtually anything you’d ever do on an iPad. It’s also the only Apple tablet with Face ID, plus it has a better speaker setup than the iPad Air. We gave it a score of 84 in our review, with the only real drawback being its price. Also at BJ's for $45 less, if you have a membership there.\nApple iPad Pro 13-inch (M4) for $1,099 ($200 off): The 13-inch iPad Pro has all the same specs as the 11-inch model, only it's bigger and more expensive. Again, it may be worth the extra cost if you plan to multitask regularly or just want more display area for enjoying movies. Also at Target and Best Buy.\nBest Mac deals\n \nApple MacBook Air (15-inch, M4) for $999 ($200 off): The 15-inch MacBook Air is nearly identical to the smaller version but features more robust speakers and a more spacious trackpad alongside its roomier display. $999 is the lowest price we've tracked.\nApple MacBook Pro (14-inch, M4 Pro) for $1,699 ($300 off): The MacBook Pro goes beyond most people’s needs, but it remains a powerhouse for coders, media editors or anyone else with especially demanding workloads. We gave it a score of 92 last November. Just keep in mind that it’s heavier than the MacBook Air and that it still lacks a standard USB-A port. Also at Best Buy.\nApple Mac mini (M4) for $499 ($100 off): The newest version of Apple’s tiny desktop PC has a smaller overall footprint, a faster M4 chip, 16GB of RAM as standard (finally), two front-facing USB-C ports (finally!), an extra Thunderbolt 4 port and the ability to drive three external displays. It lacks USB-A ports, however. We gave the M4 Pro model a review score of 90. This deal is for the entry-level version with a base M4 chip, 16GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD — we’ve seen it fall as low as $469 in the past, but this is still a decent savings compared to buying direct from Apple. Also at Best Buy.\nBest Apple Watch deals\n \nApple Watch SE (GPS, 40mm) for $169 ($80 off): As with the more premium models, we wouldn’t be surprised to see an update to Apple’s budget smartwatch sometime soon (and we have a few suggestions on the matter). But thanks to discounts like this, the Apple Watch SE has turned out to be the most affordable way to get an iPhone companion for your wrist. Despite a lackluster screen and limited extra features, it handles the basics well. Also at Target.\nBest Apple accessories deals\n \nApple Pencil Pro for $99 ($30 off): The highest-end option in Apple’s confusing stylus lineup, the Pencil Pro supports pressure sensitivity, wireless charging, tilt detection, haptic feedback and support for Apple’s double tap and squeeze gestures, among other perks. It’s a lovely tool for more intricate sketching and note-taking, but the catch is that it’s only compatible with the M4 iPad Pro, M2 and M3 iPad Air and most recent iPad mini. We've seen this deal fairly often over the course of the year, but it's a decent discount compared to buying from Apple directly. Also at Walmart, Best Buy and Target.\nApple Pencil (USB-C) for $69 ($10 off): This more affordable Apple Pencil doesn’t support pressure sensitivity, but it still makes for a useful stylus for the basics. If you’re a casual note-taker and can live without wireless charging, you’ll save a few bucks by picking this one up. Also at Walmart, Best Buy and Target.\nRead more Apple coverage:\n\nThe best AirPods\nThe best Apple Watches\nThe best MacBooks\nThe best iPhones\nThe best iPads\n\nFollow @EngadgetDeals on X for the latest tech deals and buying advice.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/best-apple-deals-150020110.html?src=rss",
    "full_text": "It goes without saying that Apple devices tend to be fairly high-quality — the company's gear currently occupies the top spots in several of our buying guides, from laptops and tablets to smartphones and smartwatches. They can even work as a hearing aid, though their six-hour battery life still isn’t the best, and you should only get them if you’re all-in on Apple hardware. Apple iPad Air 13-inch (M3) for $649 ($150 off): Engadget's Nate Ingraham gave the 13-inch iPad Air a score of 89 when it was released in March. We gave it a score of 84 in our review, with the only real drawback being its price. Also at BJ's for $45 less, if you have a membership there.
