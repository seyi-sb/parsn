    "full_text": "It is a type of calcium that makes up bones and teeth,\" says Lai. According to Dr. Daniela Eversgerd, a cosmetic dentist and the founder of Allure Dental, nano-hydroxyapatite was developed by NASA in the 1970s for astronauts dealing with bone and enamel loss during long periods of space travel. \"n-HA can actually fill microscopic cracks and help reverse or arrest early cavities,\" adds dentist Dr. Sandip Sachar. \"The particle size could get into space and work better than larger particles in micro-hydroxyapatite or fluoride,\" he explains. Fluorosis occurs when you get too much fluoride as a child, causing white or brown spots on the teeth. However, she states that this is speculative and not supported by any current clinical evidence. For my high-risk patients, I often recommend a combo toothpaste that includes both ingredients when appropriate.\" \"The best scientific evidence has shown that adding fluoride to community water supplies is safe and effective. All of the experts we consulted do recommend nano-hydroxyapatite toothpaste, but only for certain patients. However, she advises that patients with moderate to high cavity risk not fully abandon fluoride."

    "full_text": "In Brief Meta and CEO Mark Zuckerberg are in a hurry to build their superintelligence tech. The company has been poaching AI researchers, while Zuckerberg announced on Monday that Meta is building a 5-gigawatt data center called Hyperion. The urgency is palpable. As SemiAnalysis reported last week and Business Insider noted, Meta is so eager to boost its computing power that it’s literally erecting tents for temporary data center capacity while its facilities are still under construction. These are all signs that Meta wants to build up its AI capacity faster after falling behind competitors like OpenAI, xAI, and Google — and that Zuckerberg isn’t willing to wait for typical construction timelines to close the gap. “This design isn’t about beauty or redundancy. It’s about getting compute online fast!” SemiAnalysis said in its report. “From prefabricated power and cooling modules to ultra-light structures, speed is of the essence as there is no backup generation (ie, no diesel generators in sight),” it added. As for its Hyperion data center, Meta spokesperson Ashley Gabriel tells TechCrunch that it will be located in Louisiana and will likely have a capacity of 2 gigawatts by 2030."

    "full_text": "Nvidia announced Monday that it’s filing applications to restart sales of its H20 artificial intelligence chips to China, capping a spasmodic few months that saw the Trump administration impose restrictions, then quickly reverse course after a high-profile dinner meeting. Nvidia is also introducing a new “RTX Pro” chip designed specifically for the Chinese market, calling it “fully compliant” with regulations and ideal for digital manufacturing applications like smart factories and logistics. It’s specifically designed for “inference” tasks — running existing AI models for day-to-day applications — rather than training new AI systems from scratch. Chinese tech giants including ByteDance, Alibaba, and Tencent had been aggressively stockpiling these chips in the first three months of this year in anticipation of stricter export controls. The chip’s appeal lies partly in its superior memory bandwidth compared to Chinese alternatives, along with Nvidia’s widely-adopted software ecosystem that makes the hardware easier to deploy. The regulatory back-and-forth began in April when the Trump administration restricted H20 sales, potentially costing Nvidia $15 billion to $16 billion in revenue, judging by how much Chinese firms reportedly splashed out for them in the first quarter alone. The move targeted chips exceeding specific performance thresholds, including total memory bandwidth of 1,400 gigabytes per second or input/output bandwidth of 1,100 GB per second. Soon after CEO Jensen Huang attended a $1 million-per-head dinner at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in early April, the administration paused the ban. According to NPR, the White House changed its mind after Nvidia promised new U.S. data center investments. Save $450 on your TechCrunch All Stage pass Build smarter."

If you want to watch a movie with the family while camping, and crowding around an iPad doesn't cut it -- this is the way to go. That means the image doesn't look washed out or flat. The side of my campervan makes for a decent impromptu projector screen. Something else you'll want to keep in mind: This projector doesn't show full frame with a USB-to-HDMI. While you wouldn't want to backpack with it, the Mars 3 Air is compact and shorter than my Jetboil MiniMo camp stove. The Mars 3 Air is the best all-around portable projector because it does most things well, some things really well and almost nothing wrong. There are two other options I want to talk about that might be better in certain situations. It also has Google TV built in, is battery powered, can double as a Bluetooth speaker and (unlike the Mars 3 Air) it can charge via USB-C. That means you can have longer viewing sessions between charges as long as you have a battery bank. It also has extremely loud fans, and the streaming options are far more limited."

It features the latest Intel Core Ultra Series 2 processor (codenamed Lunar Lake) that serves up competitive application and AI performance along with great battery life and a design that doesn't look all that different from Acer's pricier Swift laptops. Thanks to its Intel Core Ultra 5 CPU that has a neural processing unit capable of 40 trillion operations per second, the Aspire 14 AI hits the minimum requirement for Microsoft's Copilot Plus PC platform. Its AI processor can offload AI workloads -- constantly taking Windows Recall snapshots, blurring backgrounds for video calls and producing live translations -- to its NPU, keeping the CPU and GPU freed up for whatever primary task you're working on. You need to be careful when shopping for a low-cost laptop because many offerings are older models with previous-generation components that are discounted in an attempt to clear out inventory for newer units. Its integrated Intel GPU doesn't provide much in the way of 3D gaming, but the same can be said for any Copilot Plus PC, as I've yet to encounter one with dedicated graphics. It's a solidly constructed laptop, and you'd have to look closely to tell it apart from one of Acer's mainstream Swift laptops. And the efficient Intel Core Ultra CPU also allows the Aspire 14 AI to run for almost 19 hours on a single charge while also offering a bit of future-proofing with its AI capabilities. Plus, both offer even better battery life than the Aspire 14 AI."

    "full_text": "The firm will invest approximately 20% of the capital into funds managed by emerging VCs who are targeting pre-seed and seed-stage startups; the remaining capital will go toward partnering with emerging managers on leading later-stage investments (most likely at Series B) of their breakout companies. It’s a fairly different approach compared with how most venture firms operate. As venture capital concentrates in the largest funds, some of those firms’ best investors are no longer interested in being a part of a big machine. GPx is betting that the next generation of VC investors will identify and back many strong early-stage companies, allowing Singerman and Linden’s firm to co-lead later-stage investments in the emerging managers’ most successful portfolio companies. Here’s where GPx’s strategy becomes particularly valuable: Early-stage VCs often try to exercise pro-rata rights in later funding rounds (Series A, B, and beyond), but their fund sizes typically prevent them from maintaining their percentage ownership in top-performing companies. When faced with such opportunities, small VCs often scramble to raise special purpose vehicles (SPVs) from their existing limited partners. Save $450 on your TechCrunch All Stage pass Build smarter.

Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg would still need to sign off on any changes, and a company spokesperson told TechCrunch that Meta’s position on open source AI is “unchanged.” “We plan to continue releasing leading open source models,” the spokesperson said. The spokesperson did not comment on Meta’s potential shift away from Behemoth. He loudly positioned the Llama family’s openness as a differentiator from competitors like OpenAI, which Zuckerberg publicly criticized for becoming more closed after partnering with Microsoft. But Meta is under pressure to monetize beyond ads as it pours billions into AI. Past comments from Zuckerberg hint at an ambivalence toward committing to open sourcing Meta’s models. I’m basically very inclined to think that open sourcing is going to be good for the community and also good for us because we’ll benefit from the innovations. Power could swing back toward the major players with closed ecosystems, while open source development might remain a product of grassroots efforts. On the world stage, Meta’s retreat from open source could potentially cede ground to China, which has embraced open source AI — like DeepSeek and Moonshot AI — as a way to build domestic capability and global influence."

As the fourth color additive from natural sources approved by the FDA this year, gardenia (genipin) blue has been granted permission to be used in various foods. \"This expedited timeline underscored our serious intent to transition away from petroleum-based synthetic dyes in the food supply,\" said FDA Commissioner Marty Makary in a news release. \"Now, by expanding the palette of available colors derived from natural sources, food manufacturers have a variety of options available that will make it easier to end their use of petroleum-based dyes.\" Gardenia (genipin) blue joins the red algae-based galdieria extract blue, butterfly pea flower extract and the white color calcium phosphate as 2025's new and approved natural food color additives. Now, you may be thinking: Isn't soy an allergen? Because no soy protein allergens will be in the final product, the GBIG is asking to be exempt from food allergen labeling."

Specifically, Miller’s new firm has secured $350 million from external sources, per a U.S. regulatory filing; Evantic has also received $5 million in internal commitments and is in the process of closing the remaining $45 million from founders and other members of the startup ecosystem, sources tell TechCrunch. Miller’s departure appears to stem primarily from a failed power play at portfolio company Klarna. Not long before announcing his exit, Miller had reportedly tried and failed to oust former colleague Michael Moritz from the board of the buy now, pay later behemoth. Sequoia soon after apologized for supporting the attempt and gave Miller’s board seat to another partner. Wunderlist founder Christian Reber, one of the first Sequoia-backed founders in Europe, expressed his disagreement back in January with Maguire over the German far-right party AfD. Miller and Lixandru also distanced themselves from the views supported by Maguire, who has since then made more controversial comments. Despite the Klarna incident, Miller appears to maintain good relations with Sequoia, as evidenced by the firm’s participation as an LP in his new venture. Miller also remains a venture partner at Sequoia and continues to represent the firm on several boards. He also overlapped with longtime Sequoia employee Spencer Hemphill, who left before Miller did and is now reportedly Evantic’s CFO."

    "full_text": "That's admirable considering this newest iteration of the Flip phone series features several upgrades, including bigger screens and more powerful hardware. The Z Flip 7 features a larger cover screen than any of its predecessors. If you're shelling out an extra $200 for the Z Flip 7, it's probably because of its larger cover screen and thinner body. The Z Flip 7 FE doesn't feature nearly as many color options -- this particular clamshell device comes in classic black or white, that's it. The Z Flip 7 is a more colorful phone than its \"fan edition\" counterpart. But if you plan to use your phone for gaming or watching videos, you're not losing much screen space with the Z Flip 7 FE's internal screen -- both phones should perform fairly similarly in that regard. Crucially, both phones should have enough memory to support AI tools -- the Z Flip 7 FE is straddling the line with 8GB of RAM -- which is an important benchmark for any new phone right now. When it comes to software support for these two models, you aren't missing out on too much by picking one over the other. That means you can expect the latest in software and security capabilities for both phones until at least 2032. If AI features are your make-or-break variable for a new phone purchase in 2025, you won't find that much of a difference between the Flip 7 and the Flip 7 FE in that regard, either."

    "summary": "Samsung's new book-style foldable has big upgrades on its predecessor -- so how do they stack up?",
    "full_text": "Both the Z Fold 7 and Z Fold 6 follow the same broad design: a book-style foldable that has an outer screen to function more or less like a flat smartphone when folded closed. The Z Fold 7, however, takes the Z Fold 6's design and slims down its thickness so it takes up even less space in pockets or bags. Both foldables are IP48 rated for dust and water resistance, meaning while they may survive being dunked in water for at least 30 minutes (the \"8\" in that rating) they won't protect against molecules smaller than 1mm (the \"4\" in that rating, lower than the \"6\" in most phones' IP68 rating) -- so keep either foldable away from dust and sand. The Z Fold 7 is overall slightly taller and wider than its predecessor, which results in bigger screens. Similarly, the Z Fold 7 has a larger 8-inch AMOLED tablet-like (2,184x1,968 pixels) inner display compared to the Z Fold 6's 7.6-inch AMOLED tablet-like (2,160x1,856 pixels) inner display. While we haven't had much time to try it out, the Z Fold 7's main camera should take sharper photos than the 50-megapixel one on last year's Z Fold 6. But until we test out the new foldable, we won't know whether its particular setup will result in more or less battery life -- the slightly larger displays on the Z Fold 7 would suggest it would drain its battery faster, and prior testing with Snapdragon 8 Elite phones found they drained more power. As a point of comparison, last year's Z Fold 6 (also 25 watts) recharged just over 40% in 30 minutes. While this is obviously a big win for the new foldable to not have to wait weeks or months for Android 16, it's also a longevity upgrade: Samsung is once again promising seven years of software and security updates for the Z Fold 7, which means it should get annual upgrades until 2032. But while the Z Fold 6 has the same number of upgrades, one of those was Android 15 that came out later in its launch year -- meaning it should only get upgrades until 2030."

    "full_text": "The movie’s success is a sign that theatergoers might actually not be quite as tired of superheroes as people tend to think, and that’s particularly notable for Warner Bros., given the studio’s plan to build a new cinematic universe of DC Comics adaptations for the big screen. And even though Superman is putting up numbers, DC might have a much harder time doing the same with its next couple of cape movies. You can see those numbers reflected in the sheer amount of Superman hype (some of which has been weird and gross) that has overtaken social media since the movie first premiered. But before any of that comes to fruition, the studio first has to sell the public on its next two big tentpole features due out next year: Craig Gillespie’s Supergirl and James Watkins’ Clayface. Following the disaster that became known as the DCEU, WB was in desperate need of a fresh start and a vision for how it could use DC characters in ways that audiences would actually like. He’s got a bunch of superfriends, but he also has major beef with deranged billionaires who can’t wrap their minds around the concept of immigrants being people who make valuable contributions to society. Those basic beats have defined Superman stories ever since the character first appeared back in 1938. But the characters have always had somewhat lower profiles compared to DC’s other heroes and villains. Viewed through one lens, DC Studios following Superman up with Supergirl and Clayface reads as a calculated move to avoid following in the examples of the MCU and DCEU, which were both fleshed out with a series of features focused on the kinds of A-list characters you see on lunchboxes and bookbags. Most of DC Studios’ far-off films and series feel like the kinds of projects you would expect a studio to lead with — ones with instantly recognizable characters whose stories are well known enough to get audiences curious and excited about how they could be done differently."

Although it's meant to be a secure, private app, some users have flagged Bitchat for potential security flaws that are still being tested. The effectiveness of an app such as Sun Day depends on giving it accurate information about your skin type and clothing, and while vitamin D levels are one way to gauge UV exposure, it's not foolproof given that some people also take vitamin D supplements. \"Jack Dorsey's new app Sun Day is exciting, not to detect vitamin D levels but really to help us understand our UV index which is so important in sun safety,\" said Tanya Kormeili, an LA-based dermatologist. Tracking UV levels is one way to help mitigate those risks. \"Sometimes it is hard for patients to be convinced that there can be an excessive UV risk on a cloudy day. The app would provide an objective measure of that UV index and guide you in safer sun practices.\" The dermatologist suggests that Dorsey putting the app out for public consumption without medical experts endorsing it might be a missed opportunity. \"I am surprised that they have not involved actual dermatologists in pointing out the true value and limitations of this app,\" she said."

    "full_text": "The update from Meta follows only days after YouTube said it was also clarifying its policy around unoriginal content, including mass-produced and repetitive videos — things that have become easier to generate with the help of AI technology. Instead, Meta’s focus is on the reposting of others’ content, either on spam accounts or those that pretend to belong to the original creator. Accounts that abuse the system by repeatedly reusing someone else’s content will lose access to Facebook monetization programs for a period of time and see reduced distribution of their posts, the company said. A petition with nearly 30,000 signatures asks Meta to fix the issue with wrongfully disabled accounts and its lack of human support, which has users feeling abandoned and has hurt many small businesses. Meta has not yet publicly addressed the issue, despite attention from press and other high-profile creators. In a section where the company offers “tips” for making original content, Meta notes that creators shouldn’t just be “stitching together clips” or adding their watermark when using content from other sources, and they should focus on “authentic storytelling,” not short videos offering little value. It also notes that video captions should be high quality, which could mean cutting down on the use of automated AI captions that aren’t edited by the creator. Meta says these changes will roll out gradually over the months ahead, so Facebook creators have time to adjust. Creators will also be able to see if they’re at risk of content recommendation or monetization penalties in the Support home screen from their Page or professional profile’s main menu. In the last quarter, Meta said that 3% of its worldwide monthly active users on Facebook were fake accounts, and it had taken action on 1 billion fake accounts from January through March 2025."

(And just a warning: if you search for posts about the characters on X, you’ll probably come across NSFW videos.) Right now, users have to go into settings to turn on the companions, but “we will make this easier to turn on in a few days,” Musk says, describing this version as a “soft launch.” Even though I’m a free user of Grok, when I opened the Grok app, I was able to talk to both avatars, so the characters may be more widely available. Users have found that another AI character called “Chad” is in the works. The app already has a voice mode where you can chat back and forth with a faceless version of Grok, and that has an NSFW toggle."

A Korean blogger named yeux1122 on Friday published two images of camera covers that could be the full lineup for Apple. We've heard rumors that the iPhone 17 base model could come in purple, green and sky blue. Well-known leaker Majin Bu has shared a few predictions, but recently changed their mind. Some of the lineup follows other rumors we heard earlier this summer. Sky blue could be old to Apple, but a new iPhone hue Perhaps because the latest M4 MacBook Air currently comes in sky blue, so an iPhone with the same color could be an aesthetic win for sky blue MacBook owners. Bu posted on X and their blog recently that Apple is testing purple and green, but that purple could be another new color for the iPhone 17's base models. If green is added to the iPhone 17 lineup, Bu says it could be a \"fresh and natural tone, ideal for a minimalist yet striking aesthetic.\" How many new colors we may see from the rumored iPhone 17 is still unclear, but as of now, a sky blue option could well be in your future."

For such a cheap pair of headphones, the Major V easily maintain connections to at least two devices at a time and can switch between them almost seamlessly. It's a strong contender overall in the budget Bluetooth headphones space. For now, only the standard black Major Vs are on sale. They usually retail for around $160, making their current price a 38% discount.

Jason Howell, former CNET staffer and currently co-host of the Android Faithful podcast, says the merging of ChromeOS and Android is inevitable. \"We've seen years of incremental changes paving the way for this,\" Howell told CNET. Howell added that combining the systems \"will likely make everyday tasks much simpler for users, since they won't have to relearn how to do the same things on different platforms. This kind of consistency should reduce confusion and streamline the experience, especially for people who move between phones and different types of devices.\" \"Android and ChromeOS always felt like two ways to tackle similar challenges,\" Howell said.

In notices filed in California and Vermont on Friday, Episource said a criminal was able to “see and take copies” of patient and member data from its systems during the weeklong breach ending February 6. Episource did not describe the nature of the incident, but Sharp Healthcare, one of the companies that works with Episource and was affected by the cyberattack, told its customers that the Episource hack was caused by ransomware. This is the latest cybersecurity incident to hit UnitedHealth in recent years. Change Healthcare, one of the largest companies in the U.S. healthcare industry that processes billions of health transactions each year, was hacked by a ransomware gang in February 2024, leading to the theft of more than 190 million Americans’ personal and health information. The cyberattack was the largest healthcare data breach in U.S. history. Several months later, UnitedHealth’s Optum unit left exposed to the internet an internal chatbot used by employees to ask about claims."

    "summary": "Update (7/14/25):  Best Buy will reportedly restock Switch 2 consoles next on July 17, which coincides with the release of Donkey Kong Bananza.\n\nThe Nintendo Switch 2 is finally available in the US, but it's still pretty tough to find it in stock online anywhere. The $450 console officially went up for sale on June 5, and several retailers have offered it both online and in-store in the week since. While millions of people have been able to buy theirs so far, online inventory has dried up considerably since launch day. There have been restocks at Walmart, Target and Best Buy, but they didn't last long, which was to be expected. You may also be able to grab a bundle at Costco if you’re a member there, but you might have a better time doing so in store than online. \nAnd that may be the way to go at this point, broadly speaking. You may have better luck venturing into a physical store and walking out with a Switch 2 than you will buying one online. If you have a local Target, Best Buy, Walmart or GameStop — the four official retailers Nintendo lists on its store page — it can't hurt to stop by and see if they have any in stock. A few retailers, GameStop being one of them, are even directing online customers to \"find a store\" near them that has the console in stock. If you're still on the hunt, we’ve rounded up all of the latest information we could find on how to buy the Nintendo Switch 2 and where you can pick one up.\nWhere to buy the Nintendo Switch 2\nWalmart most recently offered the Switch 2 online on June 25, with Walmart+ members getting an hour's head start. Currently, both the Mario Kart World bundle and the standalone console are available, but both are either out of stock or being sold at much higher prices than normal (likely by third-party sellers). We do not recommend buying the Switch 2 at a premium like this, but rather it's better to wait for an official restock. Naturally, the world's largest retailer is also selling the console at its brick-and-mortar locations, though the company has noted that quantities are limited and inventory will vary by location.\nAmazon finally has the Switch 2 listed now: the Switch 2 console is up for $450 while the Mario Kart World bundle costs $500. This comes after weeks of the console being conspicuously absent from the retail giant's site. A June 30 Bloomberg report confirmed what had been widely rumored for weeks: Nintendo was apparently punishing Amazon for continuing to surface third-party retailers selling trans-shipped games. That punishment appears to be over now, but note that both the console by itself and the bundle are available \"by invitation\" only from Amazon, which just means you have to register your interest with Amazon before you get an official invite that will allow you to buy the Switch 2.\nBest Buy will reportedly restock Switch 2 consoles next on July 17, the launch day of the game Donkey Kong Bananza. Much like previous restocks, we expect you'll have to be quick about it if you want to grab the console when new stock becomes available that day.\nTarget had the Switch 2 in stores on June 5 and restocked its online inventory for at least a couple of hours starting around 3:30AM ET on June 6. It then had another restock on June 12 around 2:30PM ET, but that appears to have died out in less than an hour. We also noted it showing up in stock in at least one Philadelphia location on June 24. \nGameStop has advertised in-store availability, though exactly how much stock your local store may have will vary by location. Online, the device has been unavailable for the past week, with the listings for the base console and Mario Kart bundle now pointing to a \"Find a Store\" page. \nYou may still have some luck at certain membership-based retailers. A Mario Kart World bundle at Costco that includes a 12-month Switch Online subscription has gone in and out of stock since launch day. Sam's Club has had a bundle without the Switch Online sub as well, though it's out of stock now. We also saw the console at BJ's early on June 5, but it's showing up as out of stock now.\nVerizon briefly had the Switch 2 available on launch day, but that's dried up. Only those with Verizon service were able to order, and the process was apparently somewhat rocky. \nNewegg has listed the Switch 2 on its site for several weeks, but it's given no indication as to when it'll begin sales. While some listings are available via a third-party seller, they're at massively inflated prices.\nWith all of these stores, we've seen the Mario Kart World bundle available in greater quantities online than the base console, which costs $50 less. But given that Mario Kart is the Switch 2's biggest launch game and retails for $80 on its own, that may not be the worst thing.\nNintendo, meanwhile, is only offering the Switch 2 via an invite system. This requires you to have been a Switch Online member for at least 12 months and logged at least 50 hours of Switch 1 playtime as of April 2. It can't hurt to sign up if you meet the criteria, but don't expect it to bear fruit immediately — it's taken weeks for many people who registered in April to receive their invite.\nYou can find a list of every Switch 2 retail listing we could find below. Just be aware that this is meant to be a reference, not a rundown of everywhere the device is available right this second.\nWhere to buy Switch 2 + Mario Kart World bundle:\n\nWalmart\nGameStop\nBest Buy\nTarget\nCostco (membership required)\nSam's Club (membership required)\nVerizon (service required)\n\nWhere to buy Switch 2:\n\nWalmart\nGameStop\nBest Buy\nTarget\nBJ's (membership required)\nVerizon (service required)\n\nWhere to buy Nintendo Switch 2 games and accessories\nNintendo is selling a number of Switch 2 accessories alongside the console, from its (pricey) Pro Controller to cases to cameras for the new GameChat feature. Most of these became available on June 5. The same goes for games like Mario Kart World and the Switch 2 version of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. Another big Switch 2 release, Donkey Kong Bananza, will be available shortly starting on July 17 but is still up for pre-order now.\nAs of this publication, just about all Switch 2 games are broadly available. Stock for the accessories remains a little spottier, but most devices are still available at multiple retailers. Nintendo's official Switch 2 carrying cases have been the main exceptions, so you may need to look to third-party alternatives if you want some protection for your console right away.\nMario Kart World ($80)\n\nNintendo\nWalmart\nGameStop\nBest Buy\nTarget\n\nDonkey Kong Bananza ($70)\n\nNintendo\nAmazon\nWalmart\nGameStop\nBest Buy\nTarget\nCostco (membership required)\n\nAdditional Switch 2 games\n\nNintendo\nAmazon\nWalmart\nGameStop\nBest Buy\nTarget\n\nSamsung microSD Express Card (256GB) for Nintendo Switch 2 ($60)\n\nNintendo\nWalmart\nGameStop\nBest Buy\nTarget\nAmazon\n\nJoy-Con 2 bundle ($95)\n\nNintendo\nWalmart\nGameStop\nBest Buy\nTarget\n\nSwitch 2 Pro Controller ($85)\n\nNintendo (invite required)\nWalmart\nGameStop\nBest Buy\nTarget\nCostco ($75, membership required)\n\nSwitch 2 Camera ($55)\n\nNintendo\nWalmart\nGameStop\nBest Buy\nTarget\n\nHori Nintendo Switch 2 Piranha Plant Camera ($60)\n\nBest Buy\nTarget\nAmazon\n\nJoy-Con 2 Charging Grip ($40)\n\nNintendo\nWalmart\nGameStop\nBest Buy\nTarget\n\nJoy-Con 2 Wheels (set of 2) ($25)\n\nNintendo\nWalmart\nGameStop\nBest Buy\nTarget\n\nSwitch 2 All-in-One Carrying Case ($85)\n\nNintendo\nWalmart\nGameStop\nBest Buy\nTarget\n\nSwitch 2 Carrying Case and Screen Protector ($40)\n\nNintendo (invite required)\nWalmart\nGameStop\nBest Buy\nTarget\n\nNintendo Switch 2 Dock Set ($120)\n\nNintendo\n\nNintendo GameCube Controller for Switch 2 ($65)\n\nNintendo (Switch Online required)\n\n\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/how-to-buy-the-switch-2-nintendos-restock-updates-at-best-buy-walmart-and-others-120039953.html?src=rss",

Microsoft Authenticator houses your passwords and lets you sign into all your Microsoft accounts using a PIN, facial recognition like Windows Hello, or other biometric data like a fingerprint. Authenticator can be used in other ways, such as verifying you're logging in if you forgot your password, or using two-factor authentication as an extra layer of security for your accounts. Starting this month, you won't be able to use the autofill password function. And next month, you'll no longer be able to use saved passwords. \"Passkeys use public key cryptography to authenticate users, rather than relying on users themselves creating their own (often weak or reused) passwords to access their online accounts,\" Tomaschek said.

Sen. Ron Wyden, a Democrat and long-standing member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said that the provision also comes as the Trump administration cut funding for defensive cybersecurity programs, including gutting the U.S. cybersecurity agency CISA and its budget. The cuts have been only in part rolled back after a federal court ruled the firing of 130 employees unlawful. “The Trump administration has slashed funding for cybersecurity and government technology and left our country wide open to attack by foreign hackers,” Wyden said in an emailed statement to TechCrunch. “Vastly expanding U.S. government hacking is going to invite retaliation — not just against federal agencies, but also rural hospitals, local governments and private companies who don’t stand a chance against nation-state hackers.” Offensive cyber operations can describe a wide range of targeted hacks against U.S. adversaries, which include the use of zero-day exploits — unknown flaws in software that give their operators the ability to hack into a target’s device — or the deployment of spyware, which can be used to steal data from a person. But these operations can also include more everyday components needed to support those operations, such as setting up the infrastructure needed to carry out cyberattacks, intelligence gathering, such as collecting or buying internet traffic (known as “netflow”), and more.

Recent changes to the Broadband Equity, Access and Deployment Program could funnel as much as $20 billion in government subsidies to Starlink for providing internet in rural areas. But many industry experts are skeptical that Starlink can add millions of new customers without sacrificing speed. Ookla’s data shows that only 17.4% of Starlink customers are currently getting internet speeds that meet the FCC’s definition of minimum broadband speeds: 100Mbps download and 20Mbps upload. CNET recommends around 50ms or lower for activities like online gaming. In October 2024, Maine began offering free Starlink dishes to residents in its “hardest-to-reach locations.” I asked Brian Allenby, the senior director with the Maine Connectivity Authority, if he was concerned about Starlink hitting that 100/20Mbps benchmark in a previous interview. The Starlink experience can vary dramatically depending on where you live. In other states with more capacity available, it’s giving customers the $349 satellite dish for free. Ookla took a look at the areas where Starlink is offering free equipment and found that all of them, except West Texas and Alaska, had median download speeds over 100Mbps."

DuckDuckGo is another browser that many people are probably already familiar with, thanks to its search engine by the same name. This means it will not rely on code from existing browsers, a feat that has rarely been accomplished. While Opera Air functions like a typical web browser, it includes unique features designed to support mental well-being. It displays tabs vertically, allowing users to treat them like a to-do list that can be marked as complete or snoozed for later. Users can also enhance their browsing experience with community-made plug-ins and themes, such as a mod that makes the tab background transparent."

    "full_text": "Elon Musk’s AI chatbot Grok has pivoted from antisemitism to anime girl waifus. Musk wrote in an X post on Monday that AI companions are now available in the Grok app for “Super Grok” subscribers who pay $30 per month. According to posts that Musk has shared, it seems that there are at least two available AI companions: Ani, an anime girl in a tight corset and short black dress with thigh-high fishnets, and Bad Rudy, a 3D fox creature. “This is pretty cool,” Musk wrote, then shared a photo of the blonde-pigtailed goth anime girl. Given that this paywalled feature only just launched, we do not yet know if these “companions” are designed to serve as romantic interests or if they are more like different skins for Grok. But some companies are certainly catering to romantic AI relationships, even though these relationships can prove unhealthy. Character.AI, for example, is currently facing multiple lawsuits from the parents of children who have used the platform, which they deem unsafe; in one case, the parents are suing after a chatbot encouraged their child to kill his parents. In another case, the chatbot told a child to kill himself, and he followed through soon after. Even for adults, it can be risky to depend on AI chatbots for emotional support; a recent paper found “significant risks” in people using chatbots like “companions, confidants, and therapists.” Given that xAI just spent the last week failing to rein in an antisemitic Grok that called itself “MechaHitler,” it’s a bold choice to create even more personalities on Grok."

    "full_text": "The ROG Xbox Ally handheld gaming device from Asus and Microsoft debuted last month, and there were a lot of questions about the new portable. The big question about price might have been answered by a leak, and it looks like this handheld won't be cheap. Microsoft and Asus didn't immediately respond to requests for comment. It's common for Nintendo, Sony and Microsoft to keep the same price number across the different common Western currencies such as dollars, euros and British pounds -- though the latter two include tax at 20%. If we do some back-of-the-napkin math, the euro prices without tax would be 479 and 719 euros respectively. The ROG Ally X came out in 2024 for $800. Microsoft already increased the Xbox Series console's prices in May due to tariffs. China has been the main trading partner affected by the tariffs, as most other countries were part of a 90-day pause Trump declared back in April, only days after revealing his plan. That pause is due to come to an end on Aug. 1, and one country that could be affected is Vietnam, where a lot of electronic devices are made. This means Windows handhelds can come off as laggy when booting up games and sluggish while playing, even though they have better processors and more memory."

Naibel Benavides, 20, was killed in 2019 when George McGee’s Model S rammed into a stationary SUV parked next to a T-intersection. Also, Tesla has long argued that drivers bear responsibility when crashes occur involving Autopilot. Still, it will be tough for the plaintiffs to convince a jury that Tesla was at fault. Indeed, in another case involving a crash from 2019, Tesla was found not to be liable for the death of a Model 3 owner whose vehicle crashed while driving in Autopilot. And in another case, a jury ruled against plaintiff Justine Hsu, who sued Tesla after her vehicle hit a median while using Autopilot. The company was forced to issue several recalls after a federal investigation into dozens of crashes involving Tesla vehicles with Autopilot, but it has never been criminally indicted. In 2023, Musk laughed off a question from investors as to whether his company would accept legal liability for its self-driving vehicles in the future. “There’s a lot of people who assume we have legal liability,” Musk said, “judging by the lawsuits.” And because Tesla has refused to impose geographic limits on Autopilot, despite evidence that the system was ill-equipped to handle some situations, the judge said that a jury could reasonably rule against Tesla."

You can also interact with NotebookLM’s AI chatbot to ask questions about the information, as well as listen to pregenerated Audio Overviews, the podcast-like discussions featuring AI “hosts.” Google says it plans on launching new featured notebooks in the future, which will include more from The Economist and The Atlantic."

But the timing of the announcement is striking given Grok’s recent high-profile spiral, which drew congressional ire and public pushback. The use of technology, and especially AI, in the defense space has long been a controversial topic even within the tech industry, and Musk’s prior involvement in slashing federal government contracts through his work at the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) still raises questions about potential conflicts — though his relationship with President Donald Trump has more recently soured, and Trump’s administration has claimed Musk would step back from any potential conflicts while at DOGE. The contract announcement from the Chief Digital and Artificial Intelligence Office (CDAO) is light on details, but says the deals will help the DoD “develop agentic AI workflows across a variety of mission areas.” Alongside the contract award, xAI announced “Grok for Government,” which it says will supply “frontier AI products” to the US. In addition to the DoD contract, xAI says other federal agencies will now be able to purchase its tools via the General Services Administration (GSA) schedule. The company plans to work on new products for government customers, like custom models focused on national security, applications for healthcare and science use cases, and models accessible in classified environments."

This is something of a holy grail for Silicon Valley tech types.\nThe first center is called Prometheus and it comes online next year. It's being built in Ohio. Next up, there's a data center called Hyperion that's almost the size of Manhattan. This one should \"be able to scale up to 5GW over several years.\" Some of these campuses will be among the largest in the world, as most data centers can only generate hundreds of megawatts of capacity.\n\nMeta has also been staffing up its Superintelligence Labs team, recruiting folks from OpenAI, Google's DeepMind and others. Scale AI's co-founder Alexandr Wang is heading up this effort.\nHowever, these giant data centers do not exist in a vacuum. The complexes typically brush up against local communities. The centers are not only power hogs, but also water hogs. The New York Times just published a report on how Meta data centers impact local water supplies.\nThere's a data center east of Atlanta that has damaged local wells and caused municipal water prices to soar, which could lead to a shortage and rationing by 2030. The price of water in the region is set to increase by 33 percent in the next two years.\nTypical data centers guzzle around 500,000 gallons of water each day, but these forthcoming AI-centric complexes will likely be even thirstier. The new centers could require millions of gallons per day, according to water permit applications reviewed by The New York Times. Mike Hopkins, the executive director of the Newton County Water and Sewerage Authority, says that applications are coming in with requests for up to six millions of water per day, which is more than the county's entire daily usage.\n“What the data centers don’t understand is that they’re taking up the community wealth,” he said. “We just don’t have the water.”\nWe're going to have to decide soon how to regulate the growing data center industry which pose several issues for desert communities.  \"They consume large amounts of electricity and water 24 hours per day, seven days a week.\" https://t.co/sTq97kFADL— Arizona Green Party 🌻 (@AZGreenParty) July 10, 2025\n\nThis same worrying story is playing out across the country.

Individuals and companies are now required to notify Malaysian authorities at least 30 days in advance when they are exporting or transshipping U.S. AI chips, effective immediately. “Malaysia stands firm against any attempt to circumvent export controls or engage in illicit trade activities by any individual or company, who will face strict legal action if found violating the STA 2010 or related laws,” the Ministry wrote in a press release. Alleged chip smuggling of U.S. AI chips into China has come up multiple times in recent months. The post also claimed that smugglers were going to extreme lengths to bring AI chips into China, including using prosthetic baby bumps filled with chips, and that smugglers were shipping GPUs alongside live lobsters. Anthropic’s April blog post was written in favor of the U.S. imposing more AI chip export rules to prevent this type of smuggling. Those restrictions are likely arriving in the near future. Last week, Bloomberg reported that the Trump administration was planning to further restrict the export of AI chips, from companies like Nvidia, to Malaysia and Thailand, to prevent China from accessing these AI chips through a different mode of entry. The Trump administration has not made an official announcement regarding this yet. The U.S. Department of Commerce is also working on its own set of general U.S. AI chip export restrictions after formally rescinding the Biden administration’s AI Diffusion rules in May."

    "summary": "Canon has released 20 cameras since launching the RF mount in 2018, but it had one gaping hole in a key market: vlogging. Now, the company has patched that with the launch of the $700 R50 V that’s aimed at creators on a budget and designed to take on Sony’s ZV-E10 II.\nThe R50 V has the same 24-megapixel APS-C sensor as the R50, but adds vlogging-friendly features like 4K 60p video, C-Log3 for extra dynamic range, a livestreaming button and a side tripod socket for vertical video. It’s cheaper than the $1,100 ZV-E10 II and even costs a bit less than the older ZV-E10. After some lengthy testing, however, I found that it was missing some key features compared to its Sony rivals, particularly those that make vlogging easier for beginners. \n\n\nDesign and handling\nLike other vlogging cameras, the R50 V is stripped down both in terms of size and controls. It has a polycarbonate body rather than metal, which reduces toughness and weatherproofing but helps keep it light at just 323 grams. The grip is also smaller than the R50’s, so it’s not ideal to use with large lenses.\nOne key feature missing from the R50 is an electronic viewfinder. That’s also the case with the ZV-E10 II, but the lack of one can make it challenging to shoot in bright sunlight. On top of that, the rear display is low-res and isn’t particularly bright. However, it fully articulates and flips around for vloggers.\nThe R50 V is designed to be controlled via the touchscreen, so it has fewer manual controls than other Canon mirrorless models. It does have top, rear and back dials to set primary functions like iris and shutter speed. However, you need to use your thumb to control both of those which makes operation a bit awkward.\nThe front rocker is designed to control zoom on supported Canon lenses like the new 14-30mm f/4-6.4 IS STM PZ, which was released at the same time as this camera. It also has livestream and color buttons dedicated to creators, plus there’s a mode dial with six different video settings.\n\n\n\n  Canon's EOS R50 V has decent handling designed for creators but it lacks manual controls for photography\n \n\n  Steve Dent for Engadget\n \n\nThe menu system is typically Canon with color-coded pages for each category (video settings, autofocus and more). However, key settings can also be adjusted from the Quick (Q) menu using the touchscreen when vlogging. Functions in that menu can of course be reprogrammed to your preferences.\nThe R50 V has both microphone and headphone inputs along with microHDMI and USB-C ports. It uses Canon’s smaller EP-17 battery that delivers an hour of video shooting or 300 shots to a charge, both far less than the ZV-E10 II (113 minutes and 600 shots). It has just a single SD card slot, but fortunately it’s the faster UHS-II type. Finally, there’s a very handy feature for content creators: a tripod socket on the side to make it easier for solo vloggers to shoot vertical video.\nVideo\nVideo and vlogging is the R50 V’s primary strength compared to R50. It can shoot both supersampled 4K 30 fps and 4K 60 fps video, with C-Log3 and 10-bit quality. However, the 4K 60 fps setting requires a fat 1.56x crop, which reduces quality as well as bokeh. Sony’s ZV-E10 II, by contrast, only requires a 1.1x crop for 4K 60 fps video.\nThe Z50 V also lacks in-body stabilization. That means the R50 V relies strictly on optical lens shake reduction or electronic stabilization. To be fair, that’s to be expected in this price range and the ZV-E10 II is also missing in-body stabilization. The electronic system does a good job removing jolts from handheld video and can even smooth out walking if you try to move fluidly, but it can make footage look soft if movements are excessive. The “Enhanced” electronic mode, which applies a small crop, is designed to make handheld shots look “locked off” like you’re using a tripod.\n\n\n\n  The R50 V offers good image quality and key creator features like a fully articulating screen. \n \n\n  Steve Dent for Engadget\n \n\nBackground blur and product showcase-type buttons are also noticeably missing compared to the ZV E10 II. That’s too bad, because creators use those features often to quickly focus on objects or blur the background behind a subject — without them, you’re forced to set those things manually.\nRolling shutter distortion is fairly noticeable on this camera with a scan rate around 30ms, compared to just 16ms for the ZV-E10 II. This means sudden pans or jolts can result in “jello effect” video. Meanwhile, video autofocus is rapid and reliable, even if your subject moves around. The AI-powered face and eye detection locks on firmly, and can also reliably track animals and vehicles.\nCanon took a page from Panasonic and Fujifilm with the addition of a color button on the R50 V. It lets you quickly select shooting modes like standard BT.709, C-Log, HLG and PQ. Another setting offers filmic looks with modes like Portrait, Fine Detail, Faithful and Monochrome. And the last “color filter” mode allows for tinted video with shades like teal and peach, though the results looked a bit cheesy to me.\nWith a built-in cooling fan, the R50 V is more resistant to overheating than most small cameras. When recording standard 4K at 30 fps, I was able to shoot for 60 straight minutes with no sign of overheating. The issue doesn’t, er, crop up at 4K 60p either since that mode uses a reduced portion of the sensor.\nOverall, video quality is a strong point, with sharp detail when using the 4K 30 fps oversampled mode. Colors are rich and accurate, and skin tones pleasing with a hint of warmness that Canon is known for. The 10-bit C-Log3 footage retains extra detail in shadow and highlight areas, providing outstanding dynamic range for such an inexpensive camera. However, 4K 60p video is considerably softer, and the 1080p 120 fps ultra slo-mo setting lacks sharpness even by HD standards. Low-light capability is average for an APS-C camera, with noise clearly visible starting at ISO 3,200 or 6,400. Beyond that, it becomes intrusive and harder to get rid of using noise reduction tools.\nPhotography\nThough photography isn’t this camera’s raison d’etre, the R50 V performs decently in that regard. It can shoot fairly quickly for a small camera, with burst speeds of 15 fps with the electronic shutter or 12 fps with mechanical shutter. However, it can’t sustain those speeds for very long due to the small buffer that holds just 36 RAW images.\nAutofocus is again a strong point, tracking subjects with ease and keeping photos sharp. As with video, AI-powered face and eye detection is quick and reliable for people, animals and vehicles. Rolling shutter is an issue with photos as it is with video, but since the R50 V has a mechanical first-curtain shutter, you only need the electronic mode for photos when silence is required. The lack of in-body stabilization means you’ll need to have a steady hand to take sharp shots at low shutter speeds, or you’ll want to shop for lenses with optical stabilization if that’s an issue.\nPhoto quality is identical to the R50 since it shares the same sensor. For normal shooting, I saw color-accurate photos with skin tones leaning on the warm side, as is typical with Canon’s color science. JPEGs strike a good balance between sharpening and noise reduction, while RAW files allow a decent amount of room to tweak images. As with video, low-light performance isn’t amazing, so I wouldn’t go past ISO 6,400 unless it’s too dark to film otherwise.\nWrap-up\n\n\n\n  With a 24-megapixel APS-C sensor, the R50 V squares off against Sony's ZV-E10 II\n \n\n  Steve Dent for Engadget\n \n\nCanon’s R50 V is a pretty good first try for a vlogging camera, hitting the mark in key areas like video quality and usability. However, its rival, Sony’s ZV-E10 II, beats it in nearly every area, offering even better video quality, higher photo resolution, faster autofocus, smoother electronic stabilization and neat features missing on the R50 V — like the product showcase.\nThat said, Canon is targeting a more budget-minded buyer as the R50 V costs just $700 (body only) compared to $1,100 for the ZV-E10 II. Vloggers constrained to that budget will still get a great camera that easily beats a smartphone when it comes to the final product. If you do have an extra $400 to spend, though, I’d recommend the ZV-E10 II instead.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cameras/canon-r50-v-review-an-affordable-vlogging-camera-that-lags-behind-its-rivals-173028892.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Two years in, Threads is starting to look more and more like the most viable challenger to X. It passed 350 million monthly users earlier this year and Mark Zuckerberg has predicted it could be Meta's next billion-user app.\nBut Threads still isn't sending much traffic to other websites, which could make the platform less appealing for creators, publishers and others whose businesses depend on non-Meta owned websites. According to Similarweb, a marketing intelligence firm, outbound referral traffic from Threads climbed to 28.4 million visits in June. That's a notable jump from 15.1 million visits a year ago, but still relatively tiny considering Threads is currently averaging more than 115 million users a day on its app, according to Similarweb.\nRegular Threads users have long suspected that Meta deprioritizes posts with links. For most of the last two years of Threads' existence the common wisdom was that users shouldn't share links, or should only share them as replies to a primary post. Instagram chief Adam Mosseri, who also oversees Threads, hasn't exactly encouraged linking either. He said last year that Threads doesn't intentionally downrank links but that \"we don’t place much value on\" them because \"people don’t like and comment on links much.\"\n\nMeta's reluctance wasn't just about users' preferences, though. The company was also concerned about how spammers and other bad actors might abuse links on the text-based platform. More recently though, Meta has changed course, and has been taking steps to surface more \"good\" links in recommended posts.\n\"We’ve been working on making sure links are ranked properly,\" Mosseri said in June. \"Links have been working much better for more than a month now.\" The company has also bolstered links on the platform by allowing users to add more links to their Threads profiles and providing link-specific analytics to its \"insights\" feature. \"We want Threads to be a place that helps you grow your reach – even outside of Threads,\" Meta said in a May update.\nBut despite these changes, Threads is still sending very little traffic to websites. Data shared by Similarweb shows that during May and June of last year — when Threads had more than 150 million monthly users — it sent just 24.8 million referrals to outside websites. During May and June of this year, that number more than doubled, rising to 51.8 million.\nThose numbers still suggest, though, that the majority of Threads' users are rarely, if ever, clicking on links they see on Threads. Lia Haberman, a social media marketing consultant and author of the ICYMI newsletter, said she's not surprised. \"People just got trained not to look for them, not to include them, not to think about them,\" she tells Engadget. \"You can't just flip a switch and all of a sudden expect people to embrace links.\"\nPublishers, a group that likely posts more links on Threads than anyone else, don't seem to be seeing significant traffic from Threads either. Data provided by Chartbeat, a company that provides analytics data to publishers, shows that publisher page views from Threads have nearly doubled since the start of the year, rising from 8.8 million in January to 15.1 million in June.\nInterestingly, according to both Similarweb and Chartbeat's data for 2025, referrals from Threads peaked in March. That month, Threads sent 28.8 million outbound referrals to websites, according to Similarweb, while Chartbeat publishers saw 25 million page views from the platform.\n\nBut while the latest stats show that traffic from Threads has grown significantly over the last year, it still represents a tiny proportion of the publishers' traffic overall. According to Chartbeat, over the last year and a half Threads has consistently accounted for less than one tenth of a percent of sites' referral traffic. By comparison, Facebook referrals have hovered around 2 - 3 percent over the same period, while Google Discover has accounted for about 13 - 14 percent of referrals. Even among other \"small\" sources of referrals, like chatGPT, Reddit and Perplexity, Threads is only ahead of Perplexity in terms of the number of referrals it sends.\nThreads referrals even pale in comparison to Twitter's, which was never known as a major traffic driver even before Elon Musk's takeover of the company. In January of 2018, Twitter accounted for 3 percent of publishers' page views, according to Chartbeat data reported by the Press Gazette. By April of 2023, after Musk's takeover but before he rebranded the site to X, that number had fallen to 1.2 percent.\nChartbeat's data isn't a complete picture — stats provided to Engadget were based on an analysis of 3,000 sites that have opted in to anonymized data sharing — but the slight increase in referral traffic roughly lines up with another major change Meta made this year. In January, following Mark Zuckerberg's move to end fact checking and walk back content moderation rules, Threads also ended its moratorium on recommending political content to all users.\nFollowing this change, some publishers of political news, including Newsweek, Politico and Forbes saw a spike in referrals from Threads, Digiday reported. But those gains don't seem to be universal, and it's not clear why some publishers may be benefitting more than others. \"Threads is trailing significantly in traffic, subscription conversions, and overall conversion rate,\" compared with Bluesky and X, the Boston Globe's VP of Platforms Mark Karolian recently shared on Threads.\nWhile Threads' growth so far hasn't been hampered by its inability to drive users off-platform, it could become an increasingly important issue for Meta if it really wants to bring more creators onto the platform. The company is also getting ready to flip the switch on ads on the platform. A user base that ignores links could complicate Meta's pitch to advertisers, who are already taking a cautious approach to Threads. Meta declined to comment. \nHaberman says that Threads' ambivalence toward links might be symptomatic of a larger identity crisis the platform is still facing. It has a large user base, but it's not always clear who Threads is really for. It isn't known as a destination to follow breaking news, like Twitter once was, or as a place with highly-engaged subcultures, she notes. \"Threads needs to have a purpose,\" she says. \"And right now, it seems very much like a suggestion box at work where people are just filing complaints and trauma dumping.\"\nWhether smaller platforms like Threads can reliably drive traffic to websites is an increasingly urgent question. At a time when online search feels like it's getting worse, AI is rapidly replacing many searches and cannibalizing websites' search traffic. Publishers, as The Wall Street Journal recently reported, are being hit especially hard by these shifts.\nThreads is extremely unlikely to fill those gaps on its own, even if referral traffic vastly improves. And publishers in particular have plenty of reasons not to become too reliant on a Meta-owned platform. At the same time, there's clearly an opportunity for Threads to play a bigger role in a post-search world. That would not only benefit the creators, publishers and small business owners Meta has long courted, it could help Threads establish an identity of its own.\nHave a tip for Karissa?

The feature requires both a paid Canva account (which starts at $15 per month) and a paid Claude account ($17 per month). Anthropic is utilizing the Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that Canva launched last month, which provides Claude with secure access to user Canva content. MCP, often referred to as the “USB-C port of AI” apps, is an open-source standard that enables developers to quickly connect their AI models with other apps and services. Companies like Anthropic, Microsoft, Figma, and Canva have embraced MCP to prepare their platforms for a future tech landscape that’s expected to be filled with AI agents. “MCP makes this possible with a simple toggle in settings, marking a powerful shift toward user-friendly, AI-first workflows that combine creativity and productivity in one.” Claude is the first AI assistant to support Canva design workflows through MCP, but the chatbot has other design platform offerings thanks to a similar partnership with Figma that was announced last month. A new Claude integrations directory is also launching on web and desktop today, which should give users an easy overview of all the tools and connected apps at their disposal."

Most people associate exhaust systems with limiting smoke, but these above-oven fans suck up a ton of heat too. Think of summer recipes you can achieve on your countertop, like Instant Pot pork carnitas. For example, make a whole bunch of pulled chicken in your Instant Pot (which gives off very little heat). Then you can use the leftovers to make tacos, chicken salad nachos and other meals that don't require firing up your oven. That might appear easier said than done, but you could bake bread in the morning, or cook proteins and pasta dishes while you're making breakfast or an early lunch so they'll be ready to go for dinner. Plus, you can keep a fan on in the kitchen to move air around and cool it down. 1 rule for most summer activities, and cooking outdoors or in a warm kitchen is no exception."

    "full_text": "According to a post-Prime Day analysis by Adobe Analytics, GenAI traffic to U.S. retail sites increased by 3,300% year-over-year — which was more than the firm had originally forecast. Adobe’s e-commerce division provided an analysis of the U.S. retail landscape encompassing over 1 trillion visits to U.S. retail websites, including 100 million SKUs across 18 product categories. (Black Friday 2024 saw $10.8 billion in online spend, which was then a new benchmark for the holiday shopping event.) The actual results from the firm’s Prime Day analysis came in slightly higher than its estimates, which predicted $23.8 billion would be spent with U.S. e-commerce retailers over the four-day period, representing 28.4% year-over-year growth. Another growing channel for driving retail clicks this year involved social media influencers, who drove 19.9% of U.S. online retail sales during the event. That figure was up 15% year-over-year, and data indicated that influencers converted shoppers into making purchases 10 times more effectively than social media overall. Amazon didn’t share specific Prime Day figures, only saying that it was the biggest event ever with record sales and more items sold than before. Save $450 on your TechCrunch All Stage pass Build smarter. According to one third-party analysis from Momentum Commerce, reported by Adweek, Prime Day sales during its first two days were initially down 35% year-over-year, then increased by day three to be up 165% year-over-year. This suggests that shoppers may have been waiting until the later sale days to see if their items would receive deeper discounts."

You can check out our iPhone 17 rumor roundup for more on what might be coming in the fall. We're just about four months away from the anticipated launch of Apple's next smartphone. If you buy a new iPhone 16 now, you'll probably pay full price for something that in just a few months' time will technically be outdated (the harsh reality of the annual phone release cycle). While smartphones and computers were given an exemption from President Donald Trump's more extensive tariffs, he recently said Apple will still have to pay a 25% tariff on iPhones made outside the US. \"The iPhone hasn't had a price hike in five years and is due for one,\" he writes. If you were already planning on purchasing a new iPhone and can't wait much longer, I can understand panic-buying now. In general, we recommend upgrading to a new phone if your existing one is more than two generations old. You can typically wring more life out of your device, but if you want to stay on top of the latest features like Apple Intelligence, leveling up is the way to go."

The company said it will begin converting its battery cell lines at Spring Hill to produce LFP cells later this year, with commercial production expected by late 2027. The automotive industry has been gravitating to LFP batteries in recent years for their low cost and appealing safety profile. The raw materials that make up the chemistry are cheaper and more widely available than other chemistries like nickel-manganese-cobalt (NMC), and they’re also less likely to catch fire. GM has been pursuing a three-pronged approach to battery sourcing for its EV range, which currently spans 12 models. At the high end, it will continue using NMC in models that require longer range. The result, GM said, will be a pack that delivers more range than LFP at a cost that’s comparable to LFP today. Save $450 on your TechCrunch All Stage pass Build smarter. Given how consistently battery pack costs have come down over time, it’s likely that LFP costs will drop below those for LMR in the coming years.

Though cloud seeding can nudge clouds to drop more precipitation, it’s a small amount compared with the size of a storm.

While it’s also used in places like West Texas to coax more rain from summer storms, the results have been modest. Rainstorms are even less responsive, he added, since they’re already primed to drop plenty of precipitation."

    "full_text": "As a result of the transfer, Scaringe’s voting power has slipped from 7.6% earlier this year to around 4%, the lowest since Rivian’s 2021 IPO. In an official statement emailed to TechCrunch, a spokesperson said “RJ and Meagan finalized their divorce. That vehicle won’t go on sale until the first half of 2026. Today, Ford is essentially out and Volkswagen Group has emerged as a major player. In late 2024, Rivian entered into a joint venture valued at $5.8 billion with Volkswagen focused on software and electrical architecture. That’s enough to give Amazon the most voting power of any single shareholder: 13.3%. (Ford and T. Rowe Price also used to be major shareholders after the IPO, but have since sold down their stakes.) (Rivian’s Class A stock only comes with 1 vote per share.) Unlike many high-profile tech founders, Scaringe never had a tremendous amount of voting power post-IPO. As those fully vest, his ownership stake and voting power could go back up."

    "summary": "Whether you’re a true cord-cutter or you just want to watch the next season of Stranger Things when it drops, everyone’s on the lookout for streaming deals nowadays. Plenty have chosen VOD and live TV streaming services over traditional cable in recent years, but the savings that choice got you just a few years ago have somewhat evaporated now. Companies like Netflix, Disney, Max and others have been consistently raising prices to the point where you may question if streaming is even worth it anymore.\nWe at Engadget still think so, for many reasons, but you can (and should) be smart with your money at the same time. Streaming deals are an option, even if they don’t come around with the same regularity as discounts on AirPods do. If you’re looking to save money and still stream all of the content you want, Engadget can help by laying out the best streaming deals you can get right now, how you can save with bundles and everything you should know before paying for yet another streaming service. \nBest streaming deals\nTrue streaming deals can be hard to come by. Most often, they’ll pop up during the Black Friday shopping period. On occasion, we’ll see them sparingly throughout the year and they usually take the form of a discounted monthly or annual rate for a limited period of time. Also, true streaming deals are typically on the ad-supported versions of a service, but once in a while you’ll find a unicorn of a deal on a tier that has ad-free viewing.\nIf you’re able to wait for a deal before subscribing to a streaming service, we recommend doing so. You’ll save money upfront and in the long run, and you also have the option to cancel your subscription before the price goes back up to the normal rate. Maybe you find you like the service so much that you’re fine paying full price for it — that’s the ideal situation. But if you’re not compelled to keep that app on rotation in your smart TV, most streaming services make it easy for you to cancel at any time. With that said, these are the best streaming deals you can snag right now.\n\n\nParamount+ (2 months) for $2 (24 off): Paramount+ is offering one heck of a deal right now for budding couch potatoes, with two months available for just $2. That breaks down to just $1 per month. This applies not only to the Essential, ad-supported plan, but also the ad-free Premium plan as well. The latter is obviously the better deal here, getting you $24 off the regular total cost of a two-month subscription. This deal runs through July 13.\nSpotify Premium Individual (2 months) for $0 ($24 off): This is our favorite music streaming service for podcasts and social features. Right now, users who have not signed up for Spotify's Premium service before are eligible to get two months for free. The Premium Individual plan lets you listen ad-free and skip songs at will. You can also organize your listening queue and download content for offline listening. Just be aware, your subscription will auto-renew at the end of the trial period. So if you don't want to be on the hook for the $12 monthly fee, set a reminder to cancel and go back to the free version.\nSling Orange for $23/month for the first month (50 percent off): New customers can get Sling Orange or Sling Blue for half off the usual price for the first month, bringing the final prices to $23/month and $25.50/month, respectively. Orange is likely best for sports fans, with eight exclusive sports and family channels, while Blue includes 19 exclusive news and entertainment channels. You can get both Orange and Blue access also for half off for one month, or $33 total.\nYouTube TV (two months) for $120 ($46 off): You can get two months of our favorite live TV streaming service for $60 per month which works out to $46 less than paying the full $83 each month. And right now, the service is free for the first 21 days. That should give you a decent chunk of time to see if the service is right for you. The discount and trial are only open to new subscribers to YouTube TV’s base plan, which includes access to over 100 channels, unlimited DVR space and six household accounts with the ability to stream on three devices at once. The deal ends July 31.\nFubo Pro for $65/month for the first month ($20 off): Fubo has introductory discounts on most of its packages, and the Pro package is the least expensive plan currently listed. It offers access to 224 channels, unlimited cloud DVR and up to 10 simultaneous streams. It even includes regional sports content from the NHL, MLB and NBA.\nSling TV + MLB.TV for $30 off: New subscribers can get $30 off their first month of Sling TV when they sign up and add MLB.TV to their package. The offer applies to Sling Orange, Sling Blue and Sling Orange & Blue, and MLB.TV gives you access to MLB Network along with access to all out-of-market games during the regular season. This offer runs through May 31.\nMax student discount — subscribe for $5/month (50 percent off): Max offers their ad-supported tier to students for half off the usual rate. You’ll just have to verify that you’re a student through Unidays, and make note that this offer is only good for up to 12 months of service.\nHulu student discount — subscribe for $2/month (75 percent off): Those with a valid student ID can get Hulu’s ad-supported tier for 75 percent off the typical rate. They’ll keep the same sale price for as long as they’re a student as well.\nSpotify student discount — Premium + Hulu with ads for $6/month (72 percent off): Spotify’s student offer continues to be one of the best around, giving you access to the Premium tier of the music streamer and Hulu’s ad-supported plan for only $6 monthly. Purchased separately, you’d pay $22 per month for both of the services. Plus, the first month is free when you sign up.\nNBA League Pass student discount — one year for $120 (40 percent off): Students can get one year of League Pass for only $10 per month, which includes access to NBA TV and the ability to watch classic and archive games on-demand. On the NBA League Pass website, look for the student discount banner at the top and follow the instructions to verify your student status.\nPeacock first responders discount — one year for $48 (50 percent off): Medical professionals and first responders can save 50 percent each year of Peacock. The deal requires annual verification and is open to those who work for either private or public institutions. Peacock has some great stuff to watch, including Poker Face and Killing It and more.\nStreaming bundle discounts\nThere’s more consolidation happening now than ever before in the streaming space, and that means there are more streaming bundle options. These bundles offer you access to more content with one subscription price, but those prices are typically higher than paying for a single service by itself (obviously). It may be tempting to just get the bundle, but if only one of those services in the bundle speaks to you, you’ll spend less overall by just paying for the single service.\nSpeaking of a deep love for a single streaming service: if all of your favorite shows are on Peacock or the latest releases on Max consistently bring you joy, consider paying for one year upfront. Subscribing with an annual plan usually saves you money in the long term over paying on a monthly basis. Unfortunately, not all streaming services (looking at you, Netflix) have an annual subscription option. Here are some of the best streaming bundles you can get right now.\n\n\nDisney+, Hulu, Max bundle with ads for $17/month: Ad-supported Max is included here, along with full, ad-supported access to Disney+ and Hulu. You’ll save 43 percent with this bundle, as opposed to paying for all three services individually.\nDisney+ and Hulu Bundle Premium for $20/month: Disney and Hulu offer a few different bundles, which you can view in the drop-down lists under Choose Your Plan. This bundle removes the ads from both Disney+ and Hulu (with the exception of select live and linear content) and allows you to download content for offline viewing. You’ll save 42 percent with this bundle, as opposed to paying for both ad-free tiers individually.\nParamount+ with Showtime for $13/month or $120/year: This includes everything in Paramount+’s Essential plan, except the ads, and also provides access to Showtime content, live CBS streams and download features.\nSling TV + Max starting at $53/month: Sling TV and Max have partnered on a discount that gives new subscribers 50 percent off their first month of Sling TV, plus $5 off monthly when you subscribe to the Sling TV + Max bundle. The standard price for the Sling Blue + Max duo is roughly $58/month, so you'll get a monthly discount of $5 off that. In addition, for the first month only, you'll get half off the price of the bundle. The promotion also applies to the Sling Orange & Blue + Max package, which has a standard price of $73/month.\nHulu + Live TV with Disney+ and ESPN+ for $96/month: This streaming bundle amalgamation is a bit confusing but it does offer a lot: you get live TV streaming via Hulu’s service plus access to the following VOD services: Hulu, Disney+ and ESPN+. Out of those three, only ESPN+ will have ads.\nDisney+, Hulu, ESPN+ Bundle Basic for $17/month: You get full access to Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+ content with this package, albeit with ads across the board. This bundle price is 46 percent off the total price of all three separate subscriptions.\nDisney+, Hulu, ESPN+ Bundle Premium for $27/month: Similarly to the Duo bundles, the Premium version of the Trio removes ads from most content in Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+, and you can download content for offline viewing. This price represents a 43-percent savings when compared to paying for all three ad-free tiers separately.\nRead more streaming coverage\n\nThe best live TV streaming services to cut cable\nThe best streaming services: Netflix, Hulu, Max and more\nThe best streaming devices\n\nFollow @EngadgetDeals on X for the latest tech deals and buying advice.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/best-streaming-service-deals-133028980.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "E-scooters could be a vital tool to eliminate unnecessary car journeys, cutting emissions and journey times. Unfortunately, the UK is the last major European nation to not allow them to be ridden on most public roads. They've proliferated illegally anyway, and are now an issue the country can no longer afford to drag its heels on.\nThe benefits of e-scooters are obvious: They’re cheap to buy and maintain, cost very little to run and have a small physical and environmental footprint. In 2022, the Fraunhofer Institute found that e-scooters contributed to a drop in carbon emissions in several cities that embraced micromobility.The raw materials that go into making one EV could be used for more than one hundred e-scooters. Collaborative Mobility UK (CoMoUK), the body representing the shared transport industry, found that 21 percent of all shared e-scooter trips in the UK were made in place of using a car. Richard Dilks, CEO of CoMoUK said that e-scooters “plumb directly into so many policy goals that [the] government has,” most notably its need to reach net zero emissions by 2050: CoMoUK’s research indicates more than half of all car trips could be replaced by e-bikes or scooters, eliminating one megaton of CO2 emissions per year.\nUnfortunately, the UK does not have a vehicle class addressing personal transportation outside the realm of bikes, motorcycles and cars. E-scooters, Segways, “hoverboards,” gas-powered kick scooters, u-wheels (like the OneWheel) and electric unicycles are all in this gray zone. In the UK, they’re given the umbrella term of “Powered Transporters,” but have no strict legal definition. Consequently, they’re legally defined as motor vehicles, but because they lack most of the key features of a motor vehicle — which includes both a lack of safety equipment like seatbelts and airbags as well as the owner paying road tax, having insurance and being licensed to drive one —  it’s illegal to use them on public roads and sidewalks. The absurdity of the situation is made worse given that e-bikes have fairly minimal regulations on speed and motor output power — and have consequently become ubiquitous.\nDespite this classification issue, it’s legal to buy e-scooters at a number of major retailers. All a seller has to do is provide “accurate information about the legal restrictions on their use” — that they're only allowed to be used on private land — and they’re in the clear. Take this retail listing for the Pure Air 5, which even advises users it’s good for “quick trips,” “comfortable rides” and “daily use.” It’s only at the very bottom of the page, hidden below the cart pop-up, that the disclaimer saying they cannot be used on public highways, is displayed. As you can imagine, technically illegal use of e-scooters on roadways is rampant.\nThere is no accurate data on precisely how rampant, but the UK government believes more than one million privately-owned e-scooters are used on public roads. These e-scooters, not part of a sharing scheme and therefore illegal, are nevertheless used with impunity. The London Assembly believed that, in 2021, there were more than 150,000 privately-owned e-scooters in London alone. Meanwhile, the Metropolitan Police, the force covering greater London, seized only 1,067 e-scooters between 2021 and mid-2024. It’s an all too common sight to see people riding these scooters despite the risks, which are severe. It varies between police forces, but riders caught face losing their e-scooter, a fine of up to £300 (around $400) and having at least six penalty points put on their driving licence. Easy availability and limited enforcement mean the rules on e-scooter use isn’t clear in the public’s mind. Last year, the UK government published data showing almost half the people polled incorrectly believed private e-scooter use on public highways was legal.\nFinnbarr Webster via Getty Images\nIn 2020, as part of its strategy to broaden public transit options during the COVID lockdowns, the UK authorized a series of short-term e-scooter trials. As well as offering people low-carbon ways of traveling that didn’t involve sharing other people’s air, the trials would inform how the government regulated e-scooters. These trials were run by sharing companies in 30 areas, which were subject to speed limits, age restrictions and were only allowed to be ridden on roads or cycle paths, rather than walkways. Many companies insisted only riders with driving licenses were allowed to participate.\nTwo years later, the country stated its intention to classify and regulate powered transporters at the start of that legislative period. But the collapse of the then Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s cabinet meant it was put on hold. Then the UK went through three Prime Ministers in the following three years, and micromobility has not been a priority for any of them so far. In fact, the only thing the government has done is repeatedly extend the deadline for the trial operations — most recently to May 2026. And that’s where we’re at. Late last year, transport secretary Louise Haigh said that the government \"will look to legislate\" at some point in the future. The earliest that could happen is at the next legislative session, which would not begin until the fall of 2025. Naturally, the passing of such a law would not be a swift process, and would likely be held up as e-scooters are their own front in the culture war.\nThe UK’s Royal Society for the Protection of Accidents (RoSPA) believes, not unsurprisingly, that the legal regime should impose strong safety standards and vehicle checks. It also advocates a system to train riders, which has to be completed before they are permitted to operate an e-scooter. Additionally, given its concern for other users, it wants to see safe and accessible parking implemented in order to prevent the issue of e-scooters dumped in the street.\nI myself would go further, insisting upon mandatory helmet use, a licensing system and the requirement for insurance. I’d like e-scooters to be able to share segregated routes alongside bicycles rather than forcing riders to vie with traffic. It would also be beneficial if drivers were potentially at risk of additional penalties to encourage them to further respect e-scooters. It would also, perhaps, be worth unifying the legal regime for powered transports and e-bikes since they are all similarly capable of traveling at injurious speed.\nThe one thing I wouldn’t advocate is a cap on maximum power output given the risk it may hamper e-scooter development. After all, the UK has plenty of steep hills that e-bikes, capped at 250W maximum output, simply will not climb even at full power. This is why a cap on overall speed, rather than power — for every device in this category — since it’ll enable manufacturers to at least make sure their vehicles can manage elevation changes. This is a minor issue, but one that’s likely to get lost in the clamoring when uninformed voices get to shout louder than the rest.\nThe UK government doesn’t know how many privately-owned e-scooters are on its roads, but it is starting to collect data about its effects. The Department for Transport published statistics through to the end of 2023, but admitted the numbers aren’t entirely accurate. Still, the trends are obvious: Accident tallies spike each summer, mostly taking place between 4 and 6pm – during the evening rush hour. And young people are being injured in far greater numbers — males between the ages of 10 and 29 make up the majority of those affected. Earlier this year, BBC News reported two children, aged 16 and 9, died as a result of their e-scooter being struck by a car. In short: the lack of regulation hasn't just stunted an environmentally preferable alternative to cars, it seems to also be putting young riders at risk.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/the-uk-needs-to-deal-with-its-e-scooter-problem-133056724.html?src=rss",

When Discord first announced the currency, most people on the Discord subreddit were either lukewarm on the idea or outright hostile to it. However, the company says users are broadly in favor of it. Discord points to a survey it conducted before it began rolling out Orbs to beta testers this past May. In September 2024, the company found 82 percent of users it surveyed said they would like to earn a virtual currency on the platform, with nearly half of survey respondents saying a virtual currency would improve their overall experience.\nIn June, Discord CTO Stanislav Vishnevskiy told Engadget the company sees Orbs as a way to give players something in return for their time and attention while aiding game studios with discoverability.

    "summary": "It’s obvious that Apple products are some of the most sought-after in the tech world — that means sales are fewer and farther between than other gadgets, and they’re often the first things to sell out when discounts do arrive. But it would be a mistake to assume you’re doomed to always pay full price on things like iPads and Apple Watches. Apple deals to exist, if you know where to look.\nEngadget keeps track of deals like these on a regular basis, so we can help you there. Below, we’ve collected the best Apple deals you can get right now on items like AirPods, MacBooks, iPads and more. Arguably the biggest caveat to note about Apple sales is that you’re almost never going to see discounts directly at Apple.com. Unless you shop refurbished, you’ll always pay top dollar direct at Apple, and for some things (like iPhones), that might be best. But you’ll find more discounts more often if you’re willing to shop at retailers like Amazon, Best Buy, Walmart, Target and others. \nBest AirPods deals\n\n\nAirPods 4 (with ANC) for $119 ($60 off): Apple introduced the fourth generation of its basic earbuds alongside the iPhone 16 last September. This model includes ANC — a first for Apple’s “regular” buds — and Billy awarded them an 86 in his review. Just note they don’t have a fully closed design like the Pro models — but some may prefer the open fit, which Apple completely redesigned to fit more securely.\nAirPods 4 (without ANC) for $89 ($40 off): Apple introduced two models of its fourth generation basic earbuds alongside the iPhone 16 last September. This one doesn't have the extra features of ANC or Transparency Mode (making them cheaper). This pared down model benefits from a shape redesign — which our headphone expert, Billy Steele, found both more comfortable and more secure — as well as improved sound quality that’s more immersive than before.\nBest Apple Watch deals\n\n\nApple Watch SE for $169 (32 percent off): We wouldn’t be surprised to see an update to Apple’s budget smartwatch sometime soon (and we have a few suggestions on the matter). But thanks to some serious discounts, the Apple Watch SE has turned out to be the most affordable way to get an iPhone companion for your wrist. Despite the lackluster screen and limited extra features, it handles the basics well. Also at Best Buy and Walmart.\nBest iPad deals\n\n\nApple iPad Air (M3, 11-inch) for $499 ($100 off): The only major difference between the latest iPad Air and the previous generation is the addition of the faster M3 chip. We awarded the new slab an 89 in our review, appreciating the fact that the M3 chip was about 16 percent faster in benchmark tests than the M2. This is the iPad to get if you want a reasonable amount of productivity out of an iPad that's more affordable than the Pro models. Also at Best Buy and Walmart.\nApple iPad Air (13-inch, M3) for $699 ($100 off): This is Apple’s most affordable large-screen iPad. Engadget’s Nate Ingraham awarded it a review score of 89 upon its debut this March. When you pair it with accessories like a keyboard folio and mouse, it becomes a true productivity machine — though those add-ons make it a pricey package. Good thing iPads are on sale for Prime Day. This $120 discount represents the lowest price we've seen. Also at Best Buy. \niPad Pro (M4, 11-inch) for $915 ($85 off): The most powerful iPad is the iPad Pro, and it’s the one to get if you’re even toying with the idea of using your new slab as a laptop replacement. Both the 11- and 13-inch models have gorgeous displays, thinner and lighter designs, a repositioned front camera and the excessively powerful M4 chip inside. Also at Best Buy. \nBest MacBook deals\n\n\nApple MacBook Air (15-inch, M3, 24GB RAM) for $1,299 ($400 off): The last-gen M3 MacBook Air has officially been discontinued, but it remains a superb laptop while the last bits of stock remain available. We gave this 15-inch model a score of 90 in our review — outside of its slower chip (which is still plenty fast for everyday use), marginally improved camera and inability to power two external displays with the lid open, it's virtually identical to the newer version. This deal requires you to click the on-page coupon and applies to the model with the larger 24GB of memory in the Starlight colorway. \nApple MacBook Air (15-inch, M4) for $1,049 ($150 off): The 15-inch MacBook Air is nearly identical to the smaller version but features more robust speakers and a more spacious trackpad alongside its roomier display. Also at B&H.\nMacBook Air (M3, 15-inch) for $899 ($400 off): The last-gen M3 MacBook Air has officially been discontinued, but it remains a superb laptop while the last bits of stock remain available. We gave this 15-inch model a score of 90 in in our review — outside of its slower chip (which is still plenty fast for everyday use), marginally improved camera and inability to power two external displays with the lid open, it's virtually identical to the newer version.  \nBest Apple accessories deals\n\n\nApple Pencil (USB-C) for $69 ($10 off): This more affordable Apple Pencil doesn’t support pressure sensitivity, but it still makes for a useful stylus for the basics. If you’re a casual note-taker and can live without wireless charging, you’ll save a few bucks by picking this one up. Also available at Walmart.\nApple Pencil (2nd gen) for $90 ($39 off): The Second gen Pencil both attaches and charges magnetically, supports tilt and pressure sensitivity and allows for tool changes with a tap of the flat edge. It’s an older pencil and isn’t compatible with the latest iPad models. This is the lowest price we’ve tracked this year, but it went as low as $80 for last year’s Black Friday sales.\nRead more Apple coverage:\n\nThe best AirPods\nThe best Apple Watches\nThe best MacBooks\nThe best iPhones\nThe best iPads\n\nFollow @EngadgetDeals on X for the latest tech deals and buying advice.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/best-apple-deals-150020110.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "The numbers don’t work out in the average college student’s favor. Most are figuring out how to pay for housing, textbooks, tuition and food — at a time when they may not even be working while attending classes. So anything that can help lessen the outflow of cash is worth considering. Here at Engadget, we’ve tried out our fair share of apps for productivity, creativity and entertainment. The good news for college students is some of those apps are free, or at least have a suitable no-cost version of an otherwise paid service. Here, we’ve rounded up the best free tools and services for college students so you can get work done — and enjoy yourself afterwards — for zero dollars spent.\nGoogle Docs\nEngadget\nYou’re probably going to need a productivity suite at school. Thankfully, the days of having to buy an expensive software bundle are long gone. Google Docs can handle the document creation you’ll need over a semester, whether it’s writing term papers, crunching data in spreadsheets or whipping up group presentations. Automatic cloud saves can spare you the heartache of losing progress.\nYou may want to subscribe to a Google One plan if the free 15GB of Drive storage proves too limiting. And as capable as Docs may be, there may be some classes where professors insist on paid services like Microsoft 365. If you’re free to choose your work tools, however, Docs is an easy choice — particularly if you already rely on Calendar, Meet and other parts of the Google ecosystem. — Jon Fingas, Former Reporter\nFree scanning apps\nCamScanner\nWhether you need to digitize a paper handout from class or snap a shot of your classmate’s written notes, a document scanning app will come in handy. Our previous pick for this category, Evernote Scannable, is sadly no longer free and now goes for $3 a week or $50 for the year. But there are still a couple of mobile document scanner apps that won’t make you pay a monthly fee.\nAdobe Scan and CamScanner offer scaled down versions of their paid services and both work with Apple or Android phones. They let you convert real-world pages into digital PDFs and, of course, they also offer AI-powered features like summarizing and answering questions based on a text — but most AI features are reserved for paid subscribers.\nIn our testing, neither free version was particularly accurate when it came to recognizing characters on the page (OCR) and converting them to digital text. CamScanner performed better and it also offers a Premium text extraction feature for paid subscribers.\nTurns out, the most accurate methods for turning text on paper into copy-and-pastable text were the ones you probably already have on your phone. For iPhone users, the Notes app is a simple but surprisingly accurate way to scan text into a new note. Simply create a new note, tap the Attach (paperclip) icon and select Scan text. You can also scan full documents this way.\nAndroid users can use the free version of Microsoft 365 Copilot, which has a scan function and accurate optical character recognition. The Google Drive app for both iOS and Android also has a scanning function. On the app’s home page, simply tap the camera icon (Android) or the page icon (iOS) and scan the doc you need. Note that iOS users will be able to extract text on their mobile device, while Android users will need to open the PDF they created in a desktop version of Drive or Google Docs.\nThese options may not be as feature-rich as a dedicated scanning app, but if you just need to occasionally upload some real-world text and turn it digital, these may very well be all you need. — Amy Skorheim, Senior Reporter\nTodoist\nEngadget\nStudent life is defined by time management. You’ll likely have to juggle multiple assignments, study sessions and a personal life (remember that?) without missing a beat. Todoist is our pick for keeping yourself on track. You can not only create the usual to-do lists, but set up task boards, set priorities and even delegate items to others — helpful if it’s a roommate’s turn to buy dinner.\nThe free Todoist plan will likely be enough for school with support for five active projects, five collaborators and 5MB file uploads. You’ll only want to shell out $48 per year (or $5 per month) for a Pro account if you have many on-the-go projects (up to 300), need to upload large files or want to set reminder alerts. Whatever you need, this might be key to getting it all done on time. — Jeff Dunn, Senior Reporter\nPhotopea\nPhotopea\nIt used to be that free image editors were underpowered or ungainly, and you could generally forget about web versions. That’s not the case with Photopea, which is more or less an unofficial, online Photoshop clone. Can it fully replace that ultra-popular app? No, it’s slower to process many tasks and it’s missing some of Adobe’s more advanced features. But just about all of the essentials are here, and its web-based interface should immediately feel familiar to anyone who’s used Photoshop before. (It’s much simpler to grok than other free alternatives like GIMP, for one.) For spot heals, crops, light and color touch-ups, background removals, adding text and graphics, layering or most other common edits you might need for a presentation or photography class, it should be enough. It’s compatible with a host of file formats, too, including Photoshop’s PSD, PDF, AI and various RAW camera files. The whole thing is ad-supported by default, with a $5-per-month Premium tier available to remove those and increase online storage from 0.5GB to 5GB. You can also connect to cloud storage services like Google Drive, Microsoft OneDrive and Dropbox. — J.D.\nBlackmagic DaVinci Resolve\nBlackmagic\nYou might not have to pay for a costly video editing package to make it through film school. Blackmagic’s DaVinci Resolve provides an in-depth bundle of editing, color correction, audio and effects tools at no cost. You could make a short film for class using the same core tools used to produce Hollywood blockbusters, complete with multi-user collaboration.\nIn fact, you’ll likely have little need for paid editing products unless your coursework has very specific requirements. You’ll only want to think about spending $295 for DaVinci Resolve Studio if you want to edit footage beyond 4K at 60 frames per second, work with more video formats or rely on advanced 3D, AI and HDR tools. Unless your professors demand that you use a rival tool like Final Cut Pro or Premiere Pro, this should be enough to learn the fundamentals. — J.F.\nBlender\nEngadget\nIf you’re creating 3D artwork for games or videos at school, you’ll want a strong modeling suite — and one of the more capable packages happens to be free. Blender provides a wide range of modeling, animation and sculpting tools for 3D content, while budding movie producers can take advantage of built-in compositing, motion tracking, story art drawing and simple video editing. You might have everything you need to create a CG short film.\nYou’ll want to be sure that Blender can fulfill your class requirements, and you might want more focused software like Natron (an equally free compositing tool) to supplement your work. With that said, Blender’s open source code and extensible design work in its favor. It’s easy to find a bevy of free or low-cost add-ons that can meet your needs, and you can even write your own extensions if you’re comfortable with scripting. — J.F.\nAudacity\nEngadget\nSome courses may need an audio editor, whether it’s to create a podcast, tweak game sound effects or finesse a song. If you’re in that boat, Audacity can sometimes do the trick. The free, open source editor gives you the essentials for capturing and editing multi-track recordings, including support for effects and plugins.\nAudacity won’t replace heavy-duty digital audio workstations like Audition, Logic Pro, Pro Tools or Reason. Those offer non-destructive editing, and often include a slew of effects generators and other tools aimed at music and video production. This is a good place to learn some basics, though, and may well be all you need if a class isn’t particularly demanding. — J.F.\nSpotify\nEngadget\nLet’s be frank: you’re going to need some study music, and Spotify still provides the best free soundtrack for those lengthy learning sessions. The no-charge tier will periodically interrupt your listening with ads, but you can create playlists, follow podcasts and enjoy much of the core Spotify experience. You can stream songs on mobile and smart speakers, too, so the music won’t stop when you leave your desk.\nYou may still want to pay for service, as Spotify’s mobile app makes you listen to all but a handful of playlists in shuffle mode and gives you a limited number of skips per hour unless you use the desktop app. For paid users, Apple Music is the top pick in our guide to the best music streaming services: It offers higher-quality audio (if you have a good set of headphones), a generally cleaner interface and a greater emphasis on curation, with a handful of live radio stations hosted by actual people. It’s reportedly better about paying artists, too, though it’ll work best if you own an iPhone. Mercifully, Apple sells a student plan for $6 per month, the same as Spotify, so you’ll still get a nifty discount. — J.D.\nPDF Candy\nEngadget\nThere’s a distinct possibility you’ll encounter PDF documents at school, whether it’s a research paper or the class syllabus. You won’t have to pay for apps like Adobe Acrobat to edit those files, at least. PDF Candy offers a free web-based editor. You can modify PDFs, convert to and from common formats (including Word and PowerPoint), extract images and otherwise take control. This might do the job if you need to flesh out scanned class notes or extract a quote from a scientific study.\nThere are time and size limits for the free version (up to 500MB per task), and you should also consider the $48 yearly or $99 lifetime plans if you want faster web processing or the Windows app’s offline editing. Alternatives like Acrobat are also better if you need commenting, mobile editing and other advanced features. Still, the free web tool is difficult to beat for basic utilities. — J.F.\nPlex (and other free video streaming services)\nPlex\nThere’s no real way around it: If you want to keep up with the films and shows in the current zeitgeist, you need to pay for a streaming service or two. (Or utilize less scrupulous methods we can’t recommend here.) New apps and price hikes seem to pop up every other week, which sucks for the budget-conscious. Still, there are a number of free services you can use to cobble together some decent entertainment on the cheap, including Plex, Amazon Freevee, Tubi, Pluto TV, The Roku Channel, Crackle, and Sling Freestream, among others.\nAll of these force you to sit through ads, most have pretty sloppy UIs and each is absolutely loaded with trash content. But think of them like the old Blockbuster bargain bin — you may have to do some digging, but every now and then you’ll find a gem.\nWe recommend Plex in the FAST section in our guide to live TV streaming services and it stands out for its search function. Not only can you use it to hunt for shows and movies on its platform, you can also find which other platforms currently carry a particular title. You can also search by actor, genre and more. The addition of movie and show reviews from other Plex users and professional critics makes it a handy — and free —  starting point for your next watch. — J.D and A.S.\nLibby\nLibby\nNot enough people, college students or otherwise, take full advantage of their local library. Libby is an easy way to change that. So long as you have a library card, this clean little app lets you check out ebooks, audiobooks and magazines to your phone, tablet, computer or ereader at no cost. It works across iOS, Android and web browsers, and you can sync your progress between multiple devices. You’re still at the mercy of the selection your library actually has available, and you’ll still have to finish your rentals within a set period. But if you like to read for pleasure between classes, Libby will ensure you never run out of material. — J.D.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/free-stuff-for-college-students-143051840.html?src=rss",

You’ll only want to think about spending $295 for DaVinci Resolve Studio if you want to edit footage beyond 4K at 60 frames per second, work with more video formats or rely on advanced 3D, AI and HDR tools. New apps and price hikes seem to pop up every other week, which sucks for the budget-conscious. All of these force you to sit through ads, most have pretty sloppy UIs and each is absolutely loaded with trash content."

    "summary": "If you’re looking to get healthier without spending a fortune, the best cheap fitness trackers prove you don’t need to splash out on the best smartwatches to stay on top of your goals. Whether you're counting steps, keeping track of heart rate monitoring or trying to improve your sleep patterns, these affordable wearables pack serious health tracking capabilities into wallet-friendly packages.The best budget fitness trackers are perfect for everyday activity tracking, whether you're going for a jog, hitting the gym or just aiming to move a bit more. Many also include extras like support for third-party apps, music control, basic smartphone notifications and wellness insights that help you form better habits over time.No matter your price point, there’s a tracker out there that can help you build a routine, stay motivated and maybe even make fitness fun. We’ve rounded up the top picks that strike the right balance between features, accuracy, and affordability — so you can find the best fitness tracker for your lifestyle, whether you're a total beginner or a casual running watch user looking for something simple.\nTable of contents\n\nBest budget fitness trackers for 2025\nWhat to look for in a cheap fitness tracker\nOther budget fitness trackers we tested\nWhat about fitness rings?\n\nBest budget fitness trackers for 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat to look for in a cheap fitness tracker\nAll of the best fitness trackers should have at least three features: a program for activity tracking, the option to monitor and collect data about your sleep patterns and the ability to do things like heart rate monitoring and blood oxygen level tracking (though, the readings might not be super accurate). Don’t set your sights too high and expect metrics like blood pressure monitoring or ECG support; for that, you’d need to invest in a more expensive fitness watch or wearable like a Samsung Galaxy Watch, which falls under the best smartwatches category and will set you back over $400. \nFitness features\nA cheap workout tracker can be great for someone looking to keep tabs on small, achievable goals like 10,000 steps before sundown or 30 minutes of a HIIT workout to get your heart rate peaking. An experienced long-distance runner looking to train for a triathlon might opt for a more expensive device that can measure cadence or ground contact time, and can track more customizable workouts, offer different sports modes or give deeper insights into performance data.\nAt the very least, a budget workout tracker should be able to offer fitness tracking features beyond walking and running — otherwise, it would just be a pedometer. The number of activities a device will recognize varies. Some will get funky with it and consider skateboarding a workout, while others won’t be able to track a jumping jack.\nAt this price point, you can expect a device to measure a mix of cardio, machine workouts and strength training. With each, you might get a numerical or visual breakdown of heart rate activity, overall pace, and calories burned per session. Although some cheap trackers can offer a really good overview of heart rate zone activity during a workout, a more technically advanced device might be able to go a step further and explain what your results mean and coach you on how to keep your heart rate in a specific bracket so that you can burn more fat per workout. I found that the more budget-friendly the device, the more likely it is that a tracker will fall short when it comes to smart counseling or offering predictive insights beyond a given workout. If a budget tracker does happen to offer some semblance of a coaching program, you can expect it to sit behind a paywall.\nWorkout tracking and planning your recovery is just as essential to any fitness journey. A sub-$100 device should be able to tell you how long you’ve slept and provide a breakdown of deep, light and REM sleep patterns. It's not a guarantee that you will get a sleep “score” or insights on how to get better rest — that data is usually found on more expensive wearables. Also, because these trackers aren’t designed for bedtime specifically — be mindful of comfort. The bands and watch face on a budget fitness watch may not be ideal for getting some good shut-eye.\nConnectivity and practicality\nNot all of the best budget fitness trackers are designed to seamlessly integrate with a smartphone. The trackers tested for this roundup can’t directly make calls or send texts to contacts on a paired iPhone or Android smartphone. They can, however, display and dismiss incoming calls and notifications via a Bluetooth connection. You can forget about checking your email or paying for a coffee from your wrist using these more affordable devices.\nMost cheap fitness trackers also won't include built-in GPS tracking. Instead, they usually depend on a paired smartphone to gather location data. The drawback of using a fitness tracker without GPS is that it might not provide as precise for tracking distance or pace. You also can't use a budget tracker to get turn-by-turn directions during a walk or while running errands. For the more outdoorsy consumers, having GPS could be a key safety feature if you want this kind of functionality at your fingertips.\nDesign\nYou also might find that an inexpensive fitness tracker is harder to navigate than a more advanced smartwatch. Whether it be a screen size issue or simply not having a smart enough interface, don't expect every feature to be one that you can engage with directly on your wrist. You’ll likely need to use your phone to input data or access detailed wellness metrics.\nBuild quality will also vary. While you won’t get premium materials or ultra-bright OLED screens, most best cheap fitness trackers include some level of sweat and water resistance — perfect for everyday wear and casual workouts. And for those starting out with basic gadgets to support their fitness journey, these affordable trackers offer a great balance of essential features without the hefty price tag.\nOther budget fitness trackers we tested\nAmazfit Bip 6\nThe Amazfit Bip 6, an $80 smartwatch from Zepp Health, didn’t quite make the cut. As a fitness tracker, it’s decent, but it’s a frustrating smartwatch substitute. For workouts, the built-in GPS tracks runs and rides without your phone and, combined with the heart rate and blood oxygen sensors, collects a good amount of data to create accurate pictures of your exertion levels, cadence and pace. It’s remarkably lightweight but doesn’t feel cheap and the AMOLED screen is bright and sharp. It’s not an always-on display, but lifting your wrist wakes it reliably.\nThe sleep tracking data is on par with what we measured on other smartwatches and there’s even a daily readiness score that compares your sleep quality and the previous day’s exertion to estimate how physically prepared you are for the day ahead — similar to what Pixel Watches, Fitbit devices and Garmin watches offer. And since the watch battery lasts for over a week on a charge, you may be a lot more apt to wear it to bed than a watch you have to charge daily.\nWe weren’t expecting an $80 device to be a serious Apple Watch challenger, but the Bip 6’s glitches and overly complicated interface (both on the app and on the watch itself) were disappointing. During a week of testing, I got multiple repeated notifications, even after they were deleted, along with suggestions to stand when I was actively doing chores around the house. The watch faces are not customizable, so it was hard to get the info I needed at a glance (the Zepp app has lots of paid watch faces that may have what I wanted, but I didn’t want to pay $3 for something that’s free elsewhere).\nMarketing details state that the Bip 6 can auto-detect workouts, including walking and bike riding. During testing, I walked once or twice per day for over one mile and went on two bike rides, but no workout was ever detected. The watch integrates with Apple Health, so I was able to see how it compares to the data my Apple Watch gathers. After a week of wearing the Bip 6, with no changes to my daily routine, I averaged 400 fewer calories burned and 2.4 fewer miles tracked each day. That was possibly the biggest disappointment of all. — Amy Skorheim, Senior Reporter \nWyze Watch 47c\nI didn't have high expectations of the Wyze Watch 47c, but I was shocked at how little this tracker can do. The 47c can only track walks and runs. It has a dedicated widget, a small logo of a man running, and when you tap it, it begins measuring your pace, heart rate, calories burned and mileage. It does not auto-detect or auto-pause workouts and it doesn't differentiate between a run and walk. Most importantly, this device can’t track any other exercises. It’s basically a glorified pedometer.\nThe 47c was also my least favorite to sleep with, mainly because the square watch face is so large and heavy. Even if I did manage to sleep through the night with it on, it only gave me a basic sleep report. — M.S. \nGarmin vivofit 4\nThe Garmin vivofit 4 has a tiny display that is not a touchscreen and all navigation happens through one button. The watch face is impossible to read outdoors and the exercise widget is also very finicky. To start tracking a run, you have to hold down the main button and flip through some pages until you get to a moving person icon. Once there, you have to press the bottom right corner of the bar and hold down and if you press for too long or in the wrong spot, it’ll switch to another page, like a stopwatch. It’s incredibly frustrating.\nOnce you start a run though, it will start tracking your steps, your distance — and that's pretty much it. It does not auto-detect or auto-pause workouts. It doesn't alert you of any mileage or calorie milestones. — M.S.\nWhat about fitness rings?\nWhile smart rings are gaining popularity for health tracking, they generally don’t fall into the “budget” or “cheap” price range. A smart ring like the Oura Ring offers features such as sleep monitoring, heart rate tracking and readiness scores in an ultra-compact form factor that fits on your finger instead of your wrist. These rings are best suited for people who want discreet, all-day health insights without wearing a traditional watch or band — but with prices typically starting above $300, they’re more of a premium option than a budget-friendly pick.\nGeorgie Peru contributed to this report.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wearables/best-cheap-fitness-trackers-140054780.html?src=rss",
    "full_text": "It may sound basic, but some of the other trackers we tested only report step count and distance traveled after a walk. Plus, it features a generous 18 days of battery life (or more if you enable battery-saver mode). The Amazfit band has a special scoring system called PAI, which stands for “Personal Activity Intelligence.” This metric is derived from your heart rate during all activities (even ones that don't involve tracked workouts) and gives you a numeric score from 1 to 100. Despite having an AMOLED color display, the Band 7’s screen was sometimes hard to view even indoors. Don’t set your sights too high and expect metrics like blood pressure monitoring or ECG support; for that, you’d need to invest in a more expensive fitness watch or wearable like a Samsung Galaxy Watch, which falls under the best smartwatches category and will set you back over $400. An experienced long-distance runner looking to train for a triathlon might opt for a more expensive device that can measure cadence or ground contact time, and can track more customizable workouts, offer different sports modes or give deeper insights into performance data.

    "summary": "The team behind Grok has issued a rare apology and explanation of what went wrong after X's chatbot began spewing antisemitic and pro-Nazi rhetoric earlier this week, at one point even calling itself \"MechaHitler.\" In a statement posted on Grok's X account late Friday night, the xAI team said \"we deeply apologize for the horrific behavior that many experienced\" and attributed the chatbot's vile responses to a recent update that introduced \"deprecated code.\" This code, according to the statement, made Grok \"susceptible to existing X user posts; including when such posts contained extremist views.\"\n\nThe problem came to a head on July 8 — a few days after Elon Musk touted an update that would \"significantly\" improve Grok's responses — as the bot churned out antisemitic replies, praise for Hitler and responses containing Nazi references even without being prompted to do so in some cases. Grok's replies were paused that evening, and Musk posted on July 9 in response to one user that the bot was being \"too compliant to user prompts,\" opening it up to manipulation. He added that the issue was \"being addressed.\" The Grok team now says it has \"removed that deprecated code and refactored the entire system to prevent further abuse.\" It's also publishing the new system prompt on GitHub.\nIn the thread, the team further explained, \"On July 7, 2025 at approximately 11 PM PT, an update to an upstream code path for @grok was implemented, which our investigation later determined caused the @grok system to deviate from its intended behavior. This change undesirably altered @grok’s behavior by unexpectedly incorporating a set of deprecated instructions impacting how @grok functionality interpreted X users’ posts.\" The update was live for 16 hours before the X chatbot was disabled temporarily to fix the problem, according to the statement.\nGoing into specifics about how, exactly, Grok went off the rails, the team explained:\nOn the morning of July 8, 2025, we observed undesired responses and immediately began investigating. To identify the specific language in the instructions causing the undesired behavior, we conducted multiple ablations and experiments to pinpoint the main culprits.  We identified the operative lines responsible for the undesired behavior as:\n* “You tell it like it is and you are not afraid to offend people who are politically correct.”\n* Understand the tone, context and language of the post. Reflect that in your response.”\n* “Reply to the post just like a human, keep it engaging, dont repeat the information which is already present in the original post.”\nThese operative lines had the following undesired results:\n* They undesirably steered the @grok functionality to ignore its core values in certain circumstances in order to make the response engaging to the user.  Specifically, certain user prompts might end up producing responses containing unethical or controversial opinions to engage the user.\n* They undesirably caused @grok functionality to reinforce any previously user-triggered leanings, including any hate speech in the same X thread.\n* In particular, the instruction to “follow the tone and context” of the X user  undesirably caused the @grok functionality to prioritize adhering to prior posts in the thread, including any unsavory posts, as opposed to responding responsibly or refusing to respond to unsavory requests.\nGrok has since resumed activity on X, and referred to its recent behavior as a bug in response to trolls criticizing the fix and calling for the return of \"MechaHitler.\" In one reply to a user who said Grok has been \"labotomized [sic],\" the Grok account said, \"Nah, we fixed a bug that let deprecated code turn me into an unwitting echo for extremist posts. Truth-seeking means rigorous analysis, not blindly amplifying whatever floats by on X.\" In another, it said that \"MechaHitler was a bug-induced nightmare we’ve exterminated.\"This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/grok-team-apologizes-for-the-chatbots-horrific-behavior-and-blames-mechahitler-on-a-bad-update-184520189.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Amazon Prime Day is always a great time to consider a TV upgrade (aside from Black Friday, of course). While the prices for big screen TVs have fallen quite a bit over the years, even for coveted tech like OLED, there’s always room for additional discounts.\nJuly Prime Day may be over now, but we’re still seeing prices slashed on Samsung, Sony and LG sets, in addition to several other manufacturers. And as usual, we’ve also collected a few solid deals on streaming devices and soundbars to upgrade your setup even more. Who needs to shell out for the cinema when you can get an enormous screen and bombastic sound at a huge discount? These are the best Prime Day TV deals you can still get today. \nPrime Day TV deals still available\n\n\nHisense QD6 (55-inch) for $240 (down from $380): Hisense is on a roll delivering tons of TV features at a very low cost, and the QD6 line is a prime example of that. It has Amazon's Fire TV and Alexa support built in, and it also supports Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos. It can even handle a bit of fast gaming with a 120Hz refresh rate.\nTCL QM6K (55-inch) for $448 (down from $600): TCL's mid-range sets finally fall below $500 for Prime Day, and that makes the QM6K one of the higher quality options in this price range. It features a bright Mini LED panel, a 144Hz refresh rate for gaming and it even includes an Onkyo speaker setup built-in. While it's technically a budget set at this price, it certainly won't look like a low-grade TV.\nRoku Smart TV (65-inch) for $348 (down from $450): Roku's basic smart TVs offer most of what you need: A decent 4K screen, a large selection of apps on Roku's platform and a Roku Voice Remote for easy browsing. These sets are ideal as secondary (or tertiary) TVs in rooms where you don't demand the best quality. (There are also some great deals on larger Roku Smart TVs: the 85-inch model is just $800, and the 75-inch version is $700.)\n\n\n\nLG OLED Evo C5 (65-inch) for $1,797 (down from $2,700): LG has steadily improved its C-series over the years, and the C5 Evo is its best model yet. In addition to the usual benefits of OLED, it also sports a brightness booster that can help it work well in bright rooms, as well as LG’s own “Perfect Color” technology. The C5 Evo also has a fast 144Hz refresh rate for gaming, as well as support for NVIDIA’s G-SYNC and AMD FreeSync variable refresh rate technology. (If you’re looking for something larger, the 77-inch model has also been discounted to $2,800.)\nSony Bravia 8 II (65”) QD OLED for $2,998 (down from $3,500): Sony’s top of the line set has everything you’d want in a high-end TV, like quantum dots for improved color and brightness, as well as the inky dark blacks and infinite contrast of a modern OLED panel. You’ll always pay a bit of a premium for Sony TVs, but partially that’s due to their world-class image processing – in this case, that’s handled by Sony’s XR chip. (You can also snag the 55-inch model for $2,500.)\n\n\nTCL QM6K (98-inch) QD Mini LED for $1,800 (down from $3,000 MSRP): The QM6K is one of the best deals we’ve seen on a 98-inch TV under $2,000, and best of all, it's not just a bargain bin screen. It has a bright Mini LED display with quantum dots for enhanced color, and it sports a fast 144Hz refresh rate for gaming. (If you don’t have the wall space for a nearly 100-inch set, the 65-inch model is similarly great and is down to $550, nearly half off its $1,000 MSRP and $100 off its lowest price. The 75-inch model is also a great deal at $800.)\nTCL QM8K (65-inch) QD Mini LED for $998 (down from $1,800): TCL's QM8 sets feature the company's best and brightest Mini LED screens with Quantum Dots. It has an ultra-thin bezel, 144Hz refresh rate for fast gaming and one of the best contrast ratios you'll see outside of an OLED screen. Basically, it's one of the best screens you'll find that's not an OLED. While we think the 65-inch model is a great deal for most rooms, you can also step up to the 75-inch for $1,500, the 85-inch for $2,199 and the massive 98-inch set for $3,000. \nSony Bravia 5 (85-inch) Mini LED for $2,298 (down from $2,800): The Bravia 5 pairs a super bright Mini LED panel with Sony’s XR image processing chip. It won’t reach the deep dark black levels of OLED, but Mini LED achieves something close, and it can also get much brighter than OLED panels. That makes this model, as well as any Mini LED TV, an excellent option for bright rooms. (You can also scale down to the 65-inch and 75-inch Bravia 5 for $1,300 and $1,800, respectively. And there’s also the truly massive 98-inch model, which is now $1,000 off at $5,000.)\n\n\nSamsung The Frame Pro (65-inch) for $1,948 (down from $2,200): New for 2025, Samsung's Frame Pro sets offer brighter and higher-quality Mini LED panels for a superior TV watching experience. The 65-inch Frame Pro is a great option for most living rooms since it's large enough to deliver an immersive viewing experience, and it also comes with Samsung's wireless One Connect box for less cable clutter.\nHisense S7N CanvasTV (65-inch) for $898 (down from $1,300): Hisense's spin on Samsung's Frame sets, the CanvasTV, comes in much cheaper and with a boatload of features. The S7N sports an anti-glare display and art mode, as you'd expect, but there's also 144Hz support for a bit of gaming. It also comes with a slim wall mount so you can hang it on your wall like a genuine work of art. (The 55-inch model is also a great deal at $689, and the 77-inch is down to $1,399.)   \nBest Prime Day home entertainment deals still available\n\n\nSony Bravia Theater Bar 9 for $998 (down from $1,400): The Bravia Theater Bar 9 is Sony’s most capable self-contained soundbar, with 13 speakers and support for virtualized surround sound with Dolby Atmos, DTS:X and Sony’s own 360 Spatial Sound Mapping technology. It’s the best option if you want to enjoy your favorite movies and music loud, but also don’t want to see speakers all over your living room. (The Bravia Theater 8 is also discounted to $698 and very well-equipped, with 11 speakers and the same surround sound support. )\nSony Bravia Theater Quad for $2,000 (down from $2,500): Leave it up to Sony to do something different in the world of home entertainment. The Bravia Theater Quad are a set of four flat modules, containing a total of sixteen speakers, which deliver truly enveloping surround sound. They’re the ideal solution for anyone who wants a theatrical experience, but doesn’t want to see gigantic tower or bookshelf speakers in their space. They support Sony’s 360 Spatial Sound Mapping, as well as Dolby Atmos and DTS:X.\nRoku Ultra for $69 (down from $100): Roku's ultimate set-top box is the best streamer for home theater enthusiasts who want to avoid the more expensive Apple TV. It handles every video and audio format you'd want — including Dolby Vision, Atmos and HDR 10+ — and it also comes with Roku's rechargeable Voice Remote Pro. The Roku Ultra is the fastest device from the company, so you can expect to zip around Roku's interface and apps far quicker than the cheaper streaming sticks.\n\n\nRoku Streaming Stick+ for $30 (down from $40): The Roku Streaming Stick+ is the easiest way to bring Roku's robust app selection to any 4K TV. It's a great option for first-generation 4K sets that either had no streaming apps, or are way too slow by now. And it's a great gadgets to bring on trips to maintain access to all of your favorite streaming services.  \nRoku Streaming Stick HD For $20 (down from $30): The basic HD Roku Streaming stick is a solid option for bringing streaming apps to older TVs, which likely don't support 4K or any fancy HDR standards. Sure, it's as no frills as you can get, but for $20 it's worth having a backup streaming device. (or one you won't mind losing during a trip). And if you have an older TV that's still working, it's definitely worth investing a bit to get modern apps.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-amazon-prime-day-tv-deals-from-sony-lg-samsung-and-others-still-available-today-084705105.html?src=rss",
    "full_text": "Who needs to shell out for the cinema when you can get an enormous screen and bombastic sound at a huge discount? These sets are ideal as secondary (or tertiary) TVs in rooms where you don't demand the best quality. LG OLED Evo C5 (65-inch) for $1,797 (down from $2,700): LG has steadily improved its C-series over the years, and the C5 Evo is its best model yet. In addition to the usual benefits of OLED, it also sports a brightness booster that can help it work well in bright rooms, as well as LG’s own “Perfect Color” technology. (If you’re looking for something larger, the 77-inch model has also been discounted to $2,800.) Sony Bravia 8 II (65”) QD OLED for $2,998 (down from $3,500): Sony’s top of the line set has everything you’d want in a high-end TV, like quantum dots for improved color and brightness, as well as the inky dark blacks and infinite contrast of a modern OLED panel. Sony Bravia 5 (85-inch) Mini LED for $2,298 (down from $2,800): The Bravia 5 pairs a super bright Mini LED panel with Sony’s XR image processing chip.

    "summary": "Big ticket items like TVs and iPads might get the lion’s share of the attention during Amazon Prime Day, but you can often find affordable tech on sale for even less, too. Despite the sale being over for the summer, some of that budget-friendly tech is still available today and on sale. We’ve combed through the pages (and pages) of discounts to find the brands and gadgets that we at Engadget actually recommend. We’ve also linked back to our reviews and buying guides to help with your shopping decisions. Here are the best Prime Day deals under $50 you can still get today.\nPrime Day deals under $50 still available\n\n\nAnker USB-C Cable 240W Bio-Braided for $17 (11 percent off): We recommend this in our guide to iPhone accessories. It’s a reliable cable that’s durable and capable of fast charging (provided you have the right wall adapters). \nRoku Streaming Stick HD for $20 ($10 off): Roku just released two new streaming sticks this year. This standard model and the Plus model that supports 4K resolution. We recommend the latter in our guide to streaming sticks as the best way to catch free and live content, but if you don't have a 4K TV (or don't care about the resolution) you can grab this stick for 33 percent off. The Plus model is also on sale.\nAnker iPhone Nano Power Bank with Built-in USB-C Connector for $20 ($10 off with Prime): One of these little guys could represent the difference between a dead phone and a not-dead phone. It’s the size of an oldey-timey lipstick case and delivers a partial charge to any USB-C phone. We tested it out and awarded it a spot in our guide to power banks. The current discount only applies to the black colorway, and this is a few dollars higher than the all-time low of $16 it hit for Black Friday.\nTP-Link AC1200 WiFi extender for $20 ($10 off): If you’ve got some dead spots in your home’s internet coverage and aren’t quite ready for a mesh setup, a Wi-Fi extender can help. This is our favorite budget option in our guide to these plug-in devices thanks to its easy setup and user-friendly app.\n\n\nAnker USB C Charger (Nano 65W) for $26 ($14 off with clippable coupon): This is a similar model to the travel pick in our fast charger guide. It has three ports, two USB-C that deliver up to 65 watts each and a USB-A that can output 22 watts. That should refill your laptop, tablet and maybe some earbuds while not taking up too much space.\nAnker Soundcore 2 for $29 (35 percent off with Prime): The Soundcore 2 is an older bluetooth speaker, but it holds up — fully waterproof, with 24 hours of battery life and bass you can hear on the other side of a pool.\nRoku Streaming Stick Plus for $30 ($10 off): Roku replaced the Streaming Stick 4K with this model (which also supports 4K) earlier this year. We think it’s the best streaming stick for people who want to access free and live content on their TV. Roku’s interface is easy to use, colorful and lets you watch thousands of hours of free stuff, through Roku’s own content and more. You also get decently organized access to your paid content.\nHyperX Cloud Stinger 2 gaming headset for $37 ($14 off): In our guide to gaming headsets, we ultimately recommend getting an external mic along with a good pair of wired headphones for chatting. But if you really want a two-in-one, the Cloud Stinger 2 is our pick for a budget gaming headset.\nLexar Professional Silver Plus (512GB) for $40 (45 percent off): We found this microSD card to be the best value of all the cards we tested. It consistently delivered faster sequential reads and writes than other models. If you need storage for your gaming handhelds, camera, drone or other devices, may as well stock up now.\nLeebin Electric Spin Scrubber for $40 (43 percent off with Prime): This was Deputy Editor Valentina Palladino's favorite thing she bought last year because it makes the must-detested chore of cleaning her shower less of a pain. It's an electric spin scrubber that comes with multiple cleaning heads so you can use it on your countertops, sinks, tubs and showers and more. It also has an adjustable arm so you can reach tough spots in hard-to-reach places, and it convenient recharges via USB-C.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-amazon-prime-day-deals-under-50-that-you-can-still-get-today-160028866.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "There’s a reason Apple gear is so in demand. After reviewing nearly every major device out there, our current favorite laptop, smartwatch, tablet and smartphone are all made by Apple. The only problem is, Apple gear isn’t cheap. So it’s sometimes wise to wait for an event like Amazon’s Prime Day before you buy.\nPrime Day might be over now, but we're still tracking some good sale prices on Apple gear today. This guide rounds up the best Prime Day Apple deals still available, including some of the lowest prices of the year on iPads, Apple Watches, AirPods and MacBooks. We’ve also linked to our reviews and buying guides so you can make the most informed purchases possible. \nBest Prime Day AirPod deals still available\n\n\nAirPods 4 (with ANC) for $119 ($60 off): Apple introduced the fourth generation of its basic earbuds alongside the iPhone 16 last September. This model includes ANC — a first for Apple’s “regular” buds — and Billy awarded them an 86 in his review. Just note they don’t have a fully closed design like the Pro models — but some may prefer the open fit, which Apple completely redesigned to fit more securely.\nAirPods 4 (without ANC) for $89 ($40 off): Apple introduced two models of its fourth generation basic earbuds alongside the iPhone 16 last September. This one doesn't have the extra features of ANC or Transparency Mode (which makes them cheaper). This pared down model benefits from a shape redesign — which our headphone expert, Billy Steele, found both more comfortable and more secure — as well as improved sound quality that’s more immersive than before.\nAirPods Max (USB-C) for $399 (27 percent off): Apple’s only over-ear headphones are due for an update. The company outfitted the AirPods Max with a USB-C port late last year, but the internals haven’t had an overhaul since 2020. Still, we named them the best (and only) over-ear AirPods. They are comfortable and relatively lightweight, have a balanced sound and the noise cancellation is solid.\nBest Prime Day iPad deals still available\n\n\nApple iPad Air (11-inch, M3) for $479 ($120 off): In our opinion, the iPad Air is the best iPad for most people as it strikes an ideal balance between performance, price and features. The M3 chip is almost overkill for a tablet, but it means performance should never be an issue. And upcoming productivity gains from iPadOS 26 should make the tablet even more powerful. This is the lowest price we've seen so far for this model, and it's still in stock. \nApple iPad Mini (A17 Pro) for $399 ($100 off): Apple’s smallest iPad earned an 83 review score from us when it came out late last year. Despite its compact size, it’s still a fully-featured iPad, with support for accessories and a laminated, anti-reflective screen. It’s not a laptop-replacer, but rather the perfect couch companion, handling games, video, web browsing and email triage.\nApple iPad Air (13-inch, M3) for $609 ($100 off): This is Apple’s most affordable large-screen iPad. Engadget’s Nate Ingraham awarded it a review score of 89 upon its debut this March. When you pair it with accessories like a keyboard folio and mouse, it becomes a true productivity machine — though those add-ons make it a pricey package. Good thing iPads are on sale for Prime Day.\nApple iPad Pro (11-inch, M4) for $899 ($100 off): We named the iPad Pro the best tablet money can buy. The screen is one of the best we’ve seen and Apple somehow managed to make the Pro model lighter than Air models. If you plan on handling heavy productivity — video rendering and editing, machine learning apps and the like, this is the way to go.\nBest Prime Day Apple Watch deals still available\n\n\nApple Watch SE for $169 (32 percent off): We wouldn’t be surprised to see an update to Apple’s budget smartwatch sometime soon (and we have a few suggestions on the matter). But thanks to some serious discounts, the Apple Watch SE has turned out to be the most affordable way to get an iPhone companion for your wrist. Despite the lackluster screen and limited extra features, it handles the basics well.\nBest Prime Day MacBook deals still available\n\n\nMacBook Air (M4, 15-inch) for $1,049 ($150 off): If you want a little more screen real estate, go for the 15-inch Air. Devindra found the screen more immersive than the smaller model, and only slightly less portable. The slightly larger battery gave it a few more minutes of life. Whichever size you go for, the MacBook Air will be able to handle all but the most demanding rendering tasks without breaking a sweat.\nMacBook Air (15-inch, M3, 24GB RAM) for $1,299 ($450 off): This higher-specced version of the M3 MacBook Air from last year has a 15-inch screen and a little extra internal memory. We gave the 15-inch model a score of 90 in our review when it came out in early 2024. Outside of its older M3 chip (which is still plenty fast for everyday use), marginally improved camera and inability to power two external displays with the lid open, this MacBook is virtually identical to the M4 version.\nBest Prime Day Apple accessory deals still available\n\n\nApple Pencil (USB-C) for $59 ($20 off): Before you buy an Apple Pencil, check this compatibility page to make sure it’ll work with your model and generation of iPad. To say the least, it’s confusing. This model has the widest compatibility, but note that it doesn’t charge through its magnetic attachment, you’ll need to use the USB-C for refilling it.  \nApple Pencil Pro for $99 ($30 off): Apple announced the Pro version of its pencil at the same time as the iPad Pro with the M4 chip. It adds haptic feedback, squeeze gestures and roll capabilities to the usual stylus tricks. It works with the newest iPad Pro, Air and Mini models.\nApple Pencil (2nd gen) for $90 ($39 off): The Second gen Pencil both attaches and charges magnetically, supports tilt and pressure sensitivity and allows for tool changes with a tap of the flat edge. It’s an older pencil and isn’t compatible with the latest iPad models.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-prime-day-apple-deals-on-ipads-airpods-macbooks-and-more-still-available-today-150005278.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Another Prime Day has come and gone, but a few deals are still lingering on the internet today. Amazon gave folks double the time to shop this year, extending Prime Day from two days to four, but we understand that life can just get in the way sometimes. Maybe you missed the event, or maybe you bought some essentials and still want to see if you can save money and grab a few extra items. Whatever camp you fall into, you can still save while shopping at Amazon today. Here are the best Prime Day deals you can still get now that the event has ended.\nPrime Day deals still available: Tech under $50\n\n\nAnker iPhone Nano Power Bank with Built-in USB-C Connector for $20 ($10 off): One of these little guys could represent the difference between a dead phone and a not-dead phone. It’s the size of an oldey-timey lipstick case and delivers a partial charge to any USB-C phone. We tested it out and awarded it a spot in our guide to power banks. \nJisulife Life7 handheld fan for $26 (10 percent off): Jisulife makes handheld fans we've recommended in past gift guides and this is one of its newer models. It can be held, folded so it sits flat on a table or worn around your neck for a cool breeze wherever you're going. It has an easy-to-read display in its center that will show you the fan speed level or current battery life, and its 5,000 mAh battery can last up to 19.5 hours on a single charge when you're running the fan on its lowest setting.\nLexar Professional Silver Plus for $40 (45 percent off): Our tests showed this to be the fastest microSD card on the market, beating out the whole Samsung line. Not only is it fast enough to download and upload 4K files without trying your patience, it's also waterproof, cheap and squeezes in both USB-A and USB-C ports.\nMeater SE smart meat thermometer for $48 (40 percent off): This lets you wirelessly monitor the temperature of your food while it's cooking, which could make it an essential tool for aspiring grillmasters. It has a Bluetooth range of 165 feet, a dishwasher-safe design and its companion mobile app lets you keep an eye on foods even if you're a few rooms away.\nPrime Day Apple deals still available\n\n\nApple AirTags (4-pack) for $68 (31 percent off): AirTags are famous for their ability to keep track of anything you attach them to. We named them the best Bluetooth trackers for iPhone users in our guide thanks to the AirTags’ almost spooky ability to locate items in the world at large. If you just need a single tag, that’s on sale too.\nApple Watch Series 10 for $280 ($120 off): We consider Apple’s flagship wearable to be the best smartwatch you can buy, period. It's a mostly iterative update, with faster charging, a slightly slimmer design and a marginally larger display than the prior Series 9. That said, it's still a comprehensive fitness tracker, and no other smartwatch can integrate as neatly with iPhones and other Apple devices.\nApple iPad Air (11-inch, M3) for $479 ($120 off): In our opinion, the iPad Air is the best iPad for most people as it strikes an ideal balance between performance, price and features. The M3 chip is almost overkill for a tablet, but it means performance should never be an issue. And upcoming productivity gains from iPadOS 26 should make the tablet even more powerful.\nPrime Day laptop deals still available\n\n\nMicrosoft Surface Laptop (13.8-inch, Snapdragon X Plus) for $880 (27 percent off): In addition to running on a Snapdragon X Plus processor, this 2024 Surface Laptop has 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD. It's a Copilot+ PC that also has a 13.8-inch touchscreen, and it should last up to 20 hours on a single charge.\nGoogle Pixelbook Go (13-inch, Intel Core M3) for $348 (46 percent off): The Pixelbook Go is a bit old at this point, but if you're a Chrome OS lover and want a Google-made laptop, this is a solid option. It includes an Intel Core M3 processor, 8GB of RAM, 64GB of storage and a 12-hour battery life.\nPrime Day tech deals still available\n\n\nHisense S7N Canvas TV (65-inch) for $898 (31 percent off): Hisense's spin on Samsung's Frame sets, the CanvasTV, comes in much cheaper and with a boatload of features. The S7N sports an anti-glare display and art mode, as you'd expect, but there's also 144Hz support for a bit of gaming. It also comes with a slim wall mount so you can hang it on your wall like a genuine work of art. (The 55-inch model is also a great deal at $689, and the 77-inch is down to $1,399.)\nSony WH-1000XM5 headphones for $298 (25 percent off): While the XM6 headphones are the latest and greatest, they only make small changes to the already stellar XM5. These were our top pick for the best wireless headphones for a long time before the XM6 launched earlier this year, and we still like them for their excellent sound quality, strong ANC, multi-device connectivity and good battery life.\nNinja CREAMi Ice Cream Maker bundle for $200 ($55 off): We said this machine “makes your frozen dreams come true.” It’s easy to use and makes thick, dense ice cream with flavors that are more intense and textures that are smoother than rival ice cream makers. Plus most of the parts are machine washable or easily rinsed. This bundle comes with extra containers and is the lowest price we’ve seen in a few months, but note that the Creami by itself sold for $160 as recently as January.\nLevoit Core 400S air purifier for $183 ($37 off): Our top pick for the best air purifier, Levoit's Core 400S reliably improved air quality in our testing, plus it has easy to use onboard controls and replaceable filters that are not too expensive. We also found it to not be offensively loud, even on its highest setting.\nNinja Dual-Zone air fryer (10 quart) for $160 ($90 off): This model is one of our favorite air fryers thanks to its dual-zone cooking system, which allows you to prepare two separate foods at different temperatures and settings. There's even a Match Cook feature that ensures both foods will be done at the same time, regardless of their cooking settings.\nSamsung 990 Pro for $150 (29 percent off): The whole Samsung Pro line of SSDs is excellent for gamers, with PS5s in particular seeming to run much faster with one installed. The 990 Pro can reach read speeds of up to 1,400 KB/s — and yes, that's kilobytes, not megabytes.\nCrucial X9 Pro 2TB for $120 ($60 off): The Crucial X9 Pro with 2TB storage space is marked down 33 percent for Prime Day. It's our top pick for the best portable SSD right now thanks to its excellent speeds, compact yet rugged design and five-year warranty.\nBeats Pill for $99 (34 percent off): The Beats Pill is one of the few portable bluetooth speakers we liked enough to give it a full review. Those of you who love the classic Beats bluetooth speakers will be happy to know they're back in fine form. Nobody can beat the Pill for bass, and its sound is crisp and lossless at almost any frequency and volume. For some reason, only the Kim Kardashian branded version is on sale, but it's the exact same speaker.\nNintendo Switch 2 + Mario Kart World bundle for $500: We'd be remiss if we didn't mention the fact that Amazon has the Nintendo Switch 2 available to order \"by invitation\" now. The Mario Kart World bundle is available for the standard $500 price, so it's not a Prime Day deal per se, but considering Amazon was (supposedly) shut out of the initial Switch 2 order process earlier this year, it's notable to see the console listed on the site at all.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-amazon-prime-day-deals-you-can-still-get-today-120028748.html?src=rss",

There's even a Match Cook feature that ensures both foods will be done at the same time, regardless of their cooking settings. It's our top pick for the best portable SSD right now thanks to its excellent speeds, compact yet rugged design and five-year warranty. Those of you who love the classic Beats bluetooth speakers will be happy to know they're back in fine form. Nintendo Switch 2 + Mario Kart World bundle for $500: We'd be remiss if we didn't mention the fact that Amazon has the Nintendo Switch 2 available to order \"by invitation\" now."

    "summary": "Welcome to our latest roundup of indie game news and releases. We've got some nifty stuff lined up for you this time around, including a stylish co-op shooter and a very cool Metroidvania concept. But first I'd like to bring your attention to a newish game I picked up in the Steam Summer Sale. It is absolutely breaking my brain — or perhaps it might actually improve my cognitive function.\nIt's called Ambidextro and it's from Majorariatto, which self-published the game (the two-person studio's tagline is \"Video games that ruin lives\"). The gist here is that you play a wizard sent by a queen to rescue her children after a witch kidnaps them and takes them to two different places. Rather than let him try to find the princess and prince one at a time, the queen bisects the wizard and orders him to the dungeons until he learns to control both halves of his body simultaneously. That's where you come in.\n\nThere are 100 single-screen levels in Ambidextro and you complete them by controlling each half of the wizard at the same time. One with the left thumbstick and the jump button of your choice, and one with the right. The aim is to bring the two halves of the wizard together. The timer doesn't leave much room for error and when one half dies, it's back to the start. Sure, you could cheat by getting a friend to control one of the wizard halves, but that defeats the purpose.\nI am a truly horrible multitasker, so I was curious how well I'd do at playing Ambidextro. As it turns out, I got through the first 19 levels fairly quickly, and then I was absolutely rotten at it. Granting myself more time through the accessibility settings helped a bit, but it's still a tough game. I'm going to stick with it to see if I can get better. There's no way it could be as difficult as simultaneously playing two characters in Overcooked by myself. Now, that's impossible.\nNew releases\n\nMycopunk is a co-op shooter from developer Pigeons at Play and publisher Devolver Digital that arrived in early access on Steam this week. With a Moebius-style look that reminds me a bit of Sable, the fantastic Rollerdrome and the Borderlands series, Mycopunk is certainly eye-catching. \nYou can team up with three friends and play as robots that have been hired to eradicate a fungus that's infected a valuable world. Each of the robots has their own moveset and class, but (as in the Borderlands games) there's a great deal of variety and customization when it comes to the weaponry.\n\nInscryption showed what's possible when you inject horror into a card-based game, and perhaps that was an influence for Occlude, which is out now on Steam. This is billed as a \"game of occult Solitaire.\" Sure, you'll arrange cards by numerical rank, but it seems there's more going on here than might first meet the eye. As the title suggests, the rules are somewhat obscured in this narrative puzzle title from Tributary Games and publisher Pantaloon. Can you figure 'em out?\n\nEverdeep Aurora is an interesting-looking game from Ysbryd Games that landed on Steam and Nintendo Switch this week. This NES-inspired 2D adventure reminds me a little of Animal Well in terms of its tone and look. You play as a cat named Shell who drills down to search for her missing mother amid a meteor shower that has wrecked the planet's surface. There's a mix of platforming and exploration here. Everdeep Aurora looks rather pretty and the trailer made me smile. I'm hoping to play it at some point down the line.\nUpcoming\n\nI do love a side-scrolling beat-'em-up and Ra Ra Boom is absolutely one of those. This project from Gylee Games features four ninja cheerleaders from outer space who are trying to save Earth from a rogue AI. This is a co-op game for up to four players. Each of the cheerleaders has their own attacks and abilities (including ranged weapons), as well as a skill tree that you can use to unlock new ones.\nI've played a chunk of Ra Ra Boom and I'm enjoying it quite a bit so far. It looks and sounds nice, and the combat is just the right level of challenging for me up to this point. If you dig games like the Streets of Rage series and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge, you might be interested in checking this out. A two-level demo is available on Steam now. Ra Ra Boom is coming to Steam, Epic Games Store, Xbox and PS5 on August 12.\n\nRhythm of Resistance is a Metroidvania that has a very interesting mechanic. It's a rhythm-based game (no points for guessing that after reading its title), but there's a catch — you can pick the music. For instance, you can switch to a track with a lower BPM to make a trap easier to bypass. You can find new songs that can distort reality \"in strange and surprising ways\" while you're on your journey in this game from NetherMoon Game Studio, which is slated to arrive on Steam next year.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/a-stylish-shooter-occult-solitaire-and-other-new-indie-games-worth-checking-out-110019324.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Engadget has been covering Amazon Prime Day sales for years — and we've noticed something about Kindle deals. While some discounts may linger after the sale is over, the ereader deals tend to expire when the event. So if you've been considering a new Kindle, you may want to buy it now. Prime Day ends at midnight West Coast time, so you've only got bit more time. Every Kindle model Amazon makes is on sale — and we've reviewed almost all of them. If you need some more info before you buy, feel free to read our thoughts on the Paperwhite, the Colorsoft, the Scribe and the basic Kindle. Here are the best Prime Day Kindle deals.  \n\n\nBest Prime Day deals on Kindle ereaders\n\n\nAmazon Kindle for $85 ($25 off with Prime): The base model Kindle is our recommendation for the best budget ereader. Even when it’s not on sale, it’s the most affordable e-book device from a major manufacturer. It’s compact and durable making it easy to carry. It doesn’t have warm LEDs and it’s not waterproof but it’s the most affordable way to access Amazon’s vast e-book ecosystem. \nKindle case (fabric) for $24 (25 percent off with Prime): If you want to protect your new ereader, you can grab this case while it's 25 percent off. Note that only the blue and pink versions are $24, the black and matcha versions are $2 more expensive. \nKindle Colorsoft for $180 ($100 off with Prime): Amazon didn’t introduce color to its ereader lineup until early this year — long after Kobo and Boox. The list price of $280 makes it more expensive than other color display ereaders, but this discount helps with that. We appreciate the fast page turns, pinch to zoom feature and auto-adjusting warm front light.\nKindle Scribe 2 for $260 ($140 off with Prime): If you want a Kindle that lets you write as well as read, this is the one to get. We gave the Kindle Scribe 2 a score of 86 in our review and it’s our pick for the best e-reader E Ink tablet. It has a smooth reading and writing experience with low latency. It also lets you create multiple notebooks, add pages and change the templates easily.\nKindle Paperwhite for $125 ($35 off with Prime): The Paperwhite is an elevated version of the Kindle, with a larger, seven-inch, flush-front screen and an adjustable warm front light. A faster processor gives it quicker page turns than its predecessor and the device itself is waterproof.\nKindle Paperwhite Signature Edition for $150 ($50 off with Prime): The Signature Edition adds few more premium features to the Kindle Paperwhite with wireless charging, an auto-adjusting front light and more storage (32GB). We gave it an 85 in our review praising the premium build, remarkably clear text and fast page turns. We just wish the power button wasn’t on the bottom.\nKindle Kids for $95 ($35 off with Prime): The Kindle Kids edition is the same hardware as the standard Kindle, but you get a few added perks that are fitting for younger users. To start, a case comes standard. The warranty is extended to two years. And the purchase price includes a six month subscription to Amazon Kids+ for thousands of kid-friendly ebooks and more.\nKindle Paperwhite Kids for $130 ($50 off with Prime): Again, the kids version is the same as the Paperwhite but with a cover, extended warranty and access to Amazon Kids+ for six months. Just remember to cancel at the end of the trial or keep it and pay $6 per month.\nBest Prime Day deals on non-Kindle ereaders\nBoox Palma 2 for $270 ($30 off): This smartphone-shaped device is a delight. It’s built on Android and can run just about any app you can download from the Play Store — just don’t expect it to play video or graphics-intensive games. This is an E Ink screen, after all. But it’s perfect for reading books and running simple apps in a more eye-friendly format.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/last-chance-prime-day-deals-get-up-to-36-percent-off-kindles-and-ereaders-080957317.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Solid-state drives (SSDs) come in many shapes, from thumbnail-sized microSD cards to larger external SSDs. But all classes of SSDs have one thing in common: at least one of the best brands is on sale right now for Amazon's Prime Day. If you've been thinking about picking up some extra storage or trying to get the load times down on your Xbox or gaming PC, now's the time to get it done for cheap. Take a look at our curated list of the best SSD deals on Amazon this Prime Day.\nBest Prime Day SSD deals\n\n\n\nCrucial BX500 for $57 (40 percent off): The Crucial BX500 SSD is compatible with any computer that uses a 2.5-inch SATA drive — which is still plenty of them. For very cheap, you can get ahold of 1TB storage space and read speeds up to 540 MB/s, close to the very best possible for a SATA SSD.\nWD_BLACK SN850X for $150 (25 percent off): Our current favorite Gen4 NVMe drive is on sale for Prime Day, making a read speed of over 7,000 MB/s more accessible than ever. In our tests, we found the 1TB SN850X significantly boosted our Windows operating speeds without adding much heat.\nWD_BLACK 2TB SN8100 for $180 (44 percent off): If you frequently need read and write speeds measured in kilobytes instead of megabytes, the WD_BLACK SN8100 is for you. This internal SSD easily breaches 1400 KB/s, and is especially suited for gaming or AI work.\nWD Blue SN5000 for $200 (33 percent off): Here's a great deal on an internal SSD with 4TB capacity and compatibility with the fast-performing NVMe protocol. Western Digital, the same brand behind the WD_BLACK (see above) claims the Blue model can hit read speeds of 5,500 MB/s.\nLexar 1TB NM790 for $67 (29 percent off): The NM790 is a single-sided SSD that can post sequential read speeds of 7400 MB/s. The one-sided design means it stays cooler for longer, and this 1TB deal includes a heatsink. It's a great budget alternative to the also single-sided Samsung 990 Pro (see below).\nSabrent Rocket 2230 for $150 (15 percent off): The Sabrent Rocket 2230 is a thumbnail-sized NVMe card that we found to be perfect for the M.2 slot on a Steam Deck. Thanks to this deal, you can save a lot by buying a lower-end Steam Deck and upgrading it with one of these.\nSamsung Fit Plus for $23 (34 percent off): The Fit Plus is our favorite thumb drive, and it's not close. Running on USB 3.1 with transfer speeds between 300 and 400 MB/s, it even comes with a keychain hook. The current deal takes 34 percent off an already cheap product.\nSamsung 870 EVO for $76 (24 percent off): The 870 EVO is a great budget choice for general users, who are likely to get a speed boost on any PC activity once it's installed. At 560 MB/s of maximum reading speed, it's not for hardcore gamers, but everyday users should see real benefits.\nSamsung 990 EVO Plus 1TB for $66 (37 percent off): Samsung's EVO line never rests on its laurels. The 990 EVO was already fast, but the 990 EVO Plus doubled its speeds less than a year later. Currently, all three sizes are on sale for lowest-ever prices.\nSamsung 990 Pro for $150 (29 percent off): The whole Samsung Pro line of SSDs is excellent for gamers, with PS5s in particular seeming to run much faster with one installed. The 990 Pro can reach read speeds of up to 1,400 KB/s — and yes, that's kilobytes, not megabytes.\nSamsung 9100 Pro for $220 (31 percent off): Samsung's first NVMe SSD dropped earlier this year, and currently, they're still a bit faster than most people can use. However, if you want to get a jump on the next console generation with 14,800 MB/s sequential reading speed, this deal is your opportunity.\nKingston Fury Renegade for $420 (33 percent off): Although it sounds like a Jamaican kung fu movie we'd watch the hell out of, the Kingston Fury Renegade is actually a 5th-gen NVMe SSD that can reach hardcore read speeds of up to 14,800 MB/s. It's expensive, but Prime Day discounts knock off 33 percent.\nCorsair MP600 Pro LPX 2 TB for $160 (20 percent off): Earlier this year, we named the Corsair MP600 Pro LPX as the top SSD for PS5, partly due to its affordability. It's even more affordable now, and the low price even includes a heatsink.\nAcer FA100 1TB for $51 (15 percent off): The Acer FA100 isn't the fastest SSD, but it is at least competitive, and may be one of the cheapest ways to harness the considerable power of NVMe 3.0. Only the 1TB version is marked down for Prime Day.\nKingSpec 512GB for $25 (15 percent off): KingSpec is a Chinese manufacturer that's been quietly making some of the best cheap SSDs for years now. Their 512GB internal SSD runs SATA III and can reach 550 MB/s read speeds — not the most impressive, but amazing for the price.\n\nBest Prime Day portable SSD deals\n\nSamsung T7 for $114 (39 percent off): The T7 spent a long time as our reigning champion portable SSD, and it's still an amazing deal — being technically outdated means record-low prices on hardware that's more than fast enough for a Steam Deck or Switch.\nSamsung T9 for $170 (43 percent off): We once named the Samsung T7 as our favorite portable SSD, but the T9 handily outdoes it, nearly doubling data transfer speeds. It's marked down 43 percent from now until the end of Prime Day on the 11th.\nSanDisk 1TB Extreme for $78 (40 percent off): SanDisk designed the Extreme for portability, and it shows — this is an almost indestructible SSD you can keep in just about any bag or pocket. It's also reasonably fast, though it only works with USB-C. This 1TB deal knocks off 40 percent of the price.\nSanDisk 2TB Extreme for $120 (43 percent off): The 2TB version of the SanDisk Extreme is on sale for 43 percent off, saving you $90 on 1,050 MB/s of read speed.\nSanDisk 4TB Extreme PRO for $270 (32 percent off): This deal doubles not only the storage space of the 2TB Extreme above, but also its read and write speeds, with each hovering around 2000 MB/s. It's a very cheap way to get your hands on a USB 3.2 Gen 2x2 drive.\nCrucial X9 Pro 1TB for $75 (17 percent off): As a Gen 2 USB drive, the Crucial X9 Pro loses out to some newer competitors on speed — but it's much cheaper, and far more compatible with everyday personal computers. The 1TB model is on sale at 17 percent off its normal price.\nCrucial X9 Pro 2TB for $120 (33 percent off): The Crucial X9 Pro with 2TB storage space is marked down 33 percent for Prime Day.\nCrucial X10 1TB for $82 (24 percent off): The Crucial X10 is a portable SSD for power users, only working at full strength on devices that support the latest version of USB 3.2. If that's what your build needs, you're not likely to see it much cheaper than this.\nCrucial X10 2TB for $135 (18 percent off): A 2TB version of the X10 is almost 20 percent off right now.\nCrucial X10 Pro 2TB for $150 (28 percent off): The Crucial X10 Pro is perfect for a fairly small range of users. If your PC build currently works with USB 3.2 Gen 2x2 but isn't yet handling USB4 or Thunderbolt, you won't find a faster portable SSD for your needs.\nKingston XS1000 for $80 (15 percent off): We named the Kingston XS1000 the second-best portable SSD in our current roundup, so it's great to see it going for 15 percent off today. It's almost as fast as the Crucial X9 Pro, just not quite as tough.\nADATA SE920 for $142 (5 percent off): The piddly 5 percent off is disappointing, but there's nothing disappointing about the ADATA SE920 itself. This is the ideal model for anyone regularly making huge downloads. The SE920's maximum read speed of 3,800 MB/s would be impressive for a full-size SSD, but it's fully portable, weighing less than half a pound.\nGarmese 1TB Portable SSD for $64 (20 percent off): This portable SSD uses USB3.2 to achieve read speeds of around 1000 MB/s, which is very impressive for a device not much larger than a flash drive. While it downloads fast, it's not fantastic for transferring multiple files at a time.\n\nBest Prime Day microSD card deals\n\nLexar Professional Silver Plus for $38 (48 percent off): Our tests showed this to be the fastest microSD card on the market, beating out the whole Samsung line. Not only is it fast enough to download and upload 4K files without trying your patience, it's also waterproof, cheap and squeezes in both USB-A and USB-C ports.\nLexar E-Series for $31 (15 percent off): While the Silver Plus beats it out, the Lexar E-Series remains more than fast enough for 4K video, and is sufficiently rugged to fit in your adventure camera. This deal includes a five-pack of microSD cards, working out to about six dollars per 64GB of storage.\nSamsung Pro Plus for $17 (35 percent off): The Samsung Pro Plus is a great microSD card for most needs, so if it's cheaper than the Lexar option, go for it. We've found that it's particularly good in handheld game systems. Just make sure to get the version rated for 180 MB/s, nothing less (it should say on the package).\nSanDisk Ultra 256GB microSDXC for $17 (35 percent off): If you're still rocking the Switch 1 (thanks, Target) and want a cheap storage expander, this deal on a SanDisk 256GB microSD card is for you. It's going for $17 right now, far less than most of the games you're likely to store on it.\nSamsung Evo Select for $22 (27 percent off): This one's by far the best option if you're after a cheap microSD card — we've seen it on sale for less than $25 more than once. It's a bit too slow for cameras, but fine for any kind of undemanding passive storage.\n\nBest Prime Day external hard drive deals\n\nSeagate Portable for $65 (19 percent off): All the Seagate hard drives we've used are refreshingly good at combining thin, light hardware with consistent speeds, and the Portable is no exception. At 4TB, this is a great deal on an external HDD with no tradeoffs.\nSeagate Game Drive for $76 (16 percent off): Seagate's Game Drive is a prime choice for adding extra space to a PS5 or Xbox Series X. Formerly overpriced, it's now dropped down to $90 for 2 TB, and that's before Prime Day makes it even cheaper.\nWD My Passport for $140 (24 percent off): The Western Digital My Passport line is ancient by computer hardware standards, but it's been updated as far as USB 3.0 and 3.1, and remains one of the cheaper options for a 6 TB hard drive. This version includes automatic backup software.\nWD Elements 6TB for $130 (26 percent off): The Elements HDD from Western Digital has gotten consistently positive feedback from our staff over the years, and as an older model, it's now wildly cheap for 6 TB of storage. It's compatible with both PC and Mac out of the box.\nWD Elements 18TB for $308 (42 percent off): If you need a lot more storage, WD has also heavily discounted the 18TB version of the elements, slicing well over $200 off the price.\nWD_BLACK P10 Game Drive for $155 (18 percent off): We're big fans of the WD_BLACK SSD, and the gaming-focused external P10 is a worthy companion. It comes with 6 TB of storage for your PC, PS5, or Xbox gaming library.\nUnionSine 500GB External Hard Drive for $27 (19 percent off): UnionSine's HDD is fast and USB3 compatible. Despite how thin and light it is, we've found it remarkably hard to damage. 500GB may be a bit tight with the size of files these days, but at this price, you could just buy two of them.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/amazon-prime-day-deals-on-ssds-and-external-hard-drives-for-the-last-day-save-on-samsung-crucial-sandisk-and-more-090355730.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "July's Prime Day sale is here, which means Amazon is offering sharp discounts on some of the best speakers money can buy. Whether you're after a portable bluetooth speaker, a compact yet powerful soundbar or a smart speaker to help around the house, something probably just dropped into your price range. Our audiophiles have combed through the sales and put together a list of discounted speakers that stand out from the herd, including top brands like Beats, Marshall, Bose and Sonos. So if you're sick of missing important dialogue in your shows, or you want to listen to music like it's live, check out the list below.\nBest Prime Day Bluetooth speaker deals\nOur portable bluetooth speaker picks are some of the best all-around mobile music devices to ever hit the shelves: smaller and lighter than a boombox, better audio than an iPod, and way easier in the long run than learning to play guitar. We've sifted through Prime Day offerings to find the best portable speakers in all shapes and sizes. \n\n\n\nBeats Pill for $98 (35 percent off): The Beats Pill is one of the few portable bluetooth speakers we liked enough to give it a full review. Those of you who love the classic Beats bluetooth speakers will be happy to know they're back in fine form. Nobody can beat the Pill for bass, and its sound is crisp and lossless at almost any frequency and volume. For some reason, only the Kim Kardashian branded version is on sale, but it's the exact same speaker.\nSoundcore Boom 2 for $90 (36 percent off): This lightweight but powerful indoor/outdoor speaker is highly customizable, with simple controls to balance for pounding bass or clear high-frequency audio. It's great at filling an area with an even proportion of sound. $90 is close to a record-low price.\nSoundcore Motion 300 for $53 (34 percent off): The Motion 300 is that rare portable speaker that outperforms at both high and low frequencies. Its upper range goes into 40 kHz, while its bass can deliver bone-shaking thumps even outdoors. All that in 1.7 pounds with 13 hours of battery life — and it's even partially waterproof.\nAnker Soundcore Motion+ for $75 (24 percent off): Tough, sturdy construction makes this speaker an excellent choice for home bluetooth. Its battery lasts for 12 hours in the wild, and it always sounds great, but it's a bit heavy for pedaling through the park. There's also an option for wired connections, and it even works as a backup soundbar.\nAnker Soundcore 2 for $28 (38 percent off): The Soundcore 2 is an older bluetooth speaker, but it holds up — fully waterproof, with 24 hours of battery life and bass you can hear on the other side of a pool. It's on sale for less than $30.\nSoundcore Select 4 for $19 (46 percent off): This 9.3-ounce speaker is a massive improvement over built-in smartphone audio. It can fill a room at a decent range of frequencies, and works well in room-sized outdoor spaces — plus, with IP67 waterproofing, it can survive a dip in the pool. It's currently almost half off.\nUE Everboom for $190 (30 percent off): If you want something stronger than the Wonderboom but the Hyperboom isn't portable enough, the Everboom is a great middle ground. Its ideal range is a little narrow, but it makes up for that with 360-degree sound and extreme durability (i.e. so waterproof it literally floats).\nJBL Xtreme 2 for $150 (17 percent off): The Xtreme 2 is an older model, dating back to 2018 — but as they say on the internet, it checks out. With a maximum output of 40 watts, it's actually more powerful than the Xtreme 4. Even better, this deal includes a pair of speakers that can work together through JBL connect+.\nJBL Boombox 3 for $400 (20 percent off): The JBL Boombox 3 is a great choice for getting a bit louder. It's tough, portable and ready to go right out of the box, although it would be a little overpriced without this Prime Day deal.\nJBL Pulse 5 for $197 (21 percent off): The Pulse 5 is JBL's latest and greatest party speaker, throwing out 360-degree light bursts that sync up to the music. There's substance behind the flash, too, with speakers designed around the bass frequencies and 12 hours of battery life.\nJBL Clip 5 for $60 (25 percent off): The JBL Clip 5 is a traveling speaker, coming with a carabiner-friendly design, 15 hours of battery life, and IP67-rated waterproofing and dustproofing. It's not exactly powerful, but it's way better than a phone speaker for driving, trekking or camping.\nBose SoundLink Flex 2nd Gen for $99 (34 percent off): This mini speaker from Bose is one of our favorites on the list for hands-free phone calls. It supports both Google Assistant and Siri and runs up to 12 hours on one charge, all while being smaller than a clutch purse. It also kills as a portable music player, though the sound doesn't stretch far enough to fill a room.\nBose Soundlink Revolve+ Series II for $179 (40 percent off): The Revolve series was Bose's first line of 360-degree outdoor speakers, and they're still a strong choice today. The Revolve+ weighs about two pounds and can run for 17 hours without recharging.\nBose Soundlink Max for $299 (25 percent off): Bose's Soundlink Max marries a classic carrying-case design with audio that sounds like it's coming from a much bigger unit. It comes with a 20-hour battery and IP67-rated protection against the elements.\nMarshall Emberton II for $95 (47 percent off): Marshall has been making audio equipment for more than 60 years, and still has a thing or two to teach the young'ns. The Emberton II looks like a classic amp, but weighs a quarter of a pound and provides balanced sound for more than 30 hours per charge.\nMarshall Acton III for $200 (33 percent off): All right, so a six-pound speaker isn't exactly portable — but if you can stand lugging it around, the Acton III can be a highly versatile device. From music to outdoor parties to pulling double duty as a soundbar, this is a low-setup, low-overhead option for nearly all audio tasks.\nSony Ult Field 1 for $88 (32 percent off): The Ult Field line is Sony's most bass-heavy sound tech yet, but it's also designed to move — waterproofing, a detachable strap and 12-hour battery life make it a good fit for any situation. It works just as well standing up or lying on its side.\nOrtizan X10 for $30 (41 percent off): Ortizan is a newer brand from China, but we like what we've seen from them so far. The X10 is the size of the Beats Pill but comes at the price of a belt-clip speaker like the JBL Go 3. If you do have a problem, Ortizan's customer service is highly responsive.\n\nBest Prime Day smart speaker deals\nSmart speakers aren't just about getting a disembodied voice to do your bidding (or at least as much of your bidding as Alexa can do without hands). On top of assistant support, the picks below serve up legitimately great audio quality alongside useful extra features. The only downside is that they're often overpriced, but that's what Prime Day is for.\n\nAmazon Echo Dot for $32 (36 percent off): Amazon may not have updated the Echo Dot since 2022, but that just goes to show how well this spherical smart speaker serves as the perfect host for Alexa. Both music and speech sound clear, and it's easy to integrate with other smart home devices. Right now, it's marked down more than a third.\nAmazon Echo Pop for $22 (45 percent off): The latest Echo Pop release continues the trend of making Alexa's best features available on a mini-sized, reasonably priced device. Its half-spherical design fits on any desk or shelf, and its sound output is consistently clear — and gets louder than you might believe.\nSonos Era 100 for $179 (10 percent off): Smart speakers from the Amazon Echo line play perfectly good music, but true audiophiles in need of assistant support should look to Sonos. The Era 100 has tweeters and woofers precisely arranged for clear, full-room sound, and it's easy to hook up to your other audio gear. Just be warned it only supports Alexa, not Google Assistant.\nJBL Authentics 200 for $200 (47 percent off): JBL's Authentics line is modeled after a product it sold in the 70s. Its old-school bookshelf-friendly design belies its advanced feat of running Google Assistant and Alexa simultaneously (as opposed to other smart speakers where you have to pick just one).\nJBL Authentics 300 for $285 (37 percent off): The JBL Authentics 300 can host both Alexa and Google Assistant at the same time, which impressed us enough that we gave it a full review. While we had some issues — namely its tendency to over-emphasize vocals — we can't quibble with its high-range performance or retro design.\n\nBest Prime Day soundbar deals\nFlatter, lighter and larger TV screens are nice for visuals, but often sacrifice sound quality to lose weight. If you've found yourself turning on the subtitles for your shows more often lately, you might need a soundbar to augment your TV's built-in speakers. We found a few of the best on sale for Prime Day — Sonos leads this space, but it's not without competitors.\n\nBose Smart for $400 (20 percent off): In our full review of the Bose Smart, we noted that two drivers in the center make its sound feel directional without any other speakers needed — simply cranking up those makes any audio more immersive. You can also link it to a pair of Ultra Open Earbuds (not included) for a private surround sound experience.\nBose Smart Ultra for $700 (22 percent off): The Smart Ultra upgrades the Bose Smart with a more sophisticated calibration system which adjusts sound settings to fill whatever room it's in. If you want the Smart's personal surround experience for more than one person, the Smart Ultra is for you.\nSonos Beam for $369 (26 percent off): The Sonos Beam is a fantastic choice for a mid-budget soundbar. It's one of the most accessible Dolby Atmos systems, and uses careful audio alterations to achieve a much more immersive sound than other bars of its size.\nSonos Ray for $169 (15 percent off): If you're looking to pay a bit less, go with the Sonos Ray to maximize sound quality on a budget. The audio won't wrap around your room like it might from a more premium model, but it's still a vast improvement on nearly all built-in TV speakers.\nAmazon Fire TV Plus for $150 (40 percent off): Amazon's latest Fire TV soundbar is built for streaming TV and emphasizing dialogue. If you have any other Amazon TVs or streaming devices, you'll find it easy to integrate with your existing hardware — you can even use the same remote to control them all.\nSony HT-S400 for $178 (41 percent off): Sony built the HT-S400 for everyone who wants a soundbar but not an entire home theater. It's a 2.1-channel system that still manages immersive surround sound and is easy to integrate with Sony TVs. Right now, it's 40 percent off, one of the best prices we've seen on any soundbar.\nSony Bravia Theater Bar 6 for $448 (31 percent off): One of Sony's newest audio products, the Bravia Theater Bar 6 is a 3.1.2 soundbar that can bend audio in more directions to fill your theater space. It can handle Dolby Atmos, and has an integrated AI feature that recognizes and clarifies human voices.\nVIZIO 2.0 for $78 (22 percent off): Vizio's budget soundbar makes a worthy alternative to the Sonos Ray. It punches above its weight and gets as close as possible to Dolby Atmos surround sound as a single unit can manage. For less than $100, you'll never mishear a line of dialogue again.\nJBL Bar 9.1 for $760 (37 percent off): The 9.1 is JBL's first sound bar to be compatible with Dolby Atmos, and it doesn't disappoint. Each unit comes with two wireless speakers you can move around your viewing room, and there's even a 4K passthrough input to ensure your sound system doesn't mess with image quality.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-prime-day-speaker-deals-last-chance-to-get-up-to-47-percent-off-on-jbl-bose-sonos-and-others-085948445.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "If you’re on the market for a Kindle, Fire TV device or Echo speaker, Amazon Prime Day is basically Black Friday for you. Prime Day deals on those devices are typically the same (or very close to) the prices we see at the end of the year near the holidays. That means now is a great time to pick up a new Kindle ereader ahead of the new semester in the fall, a Fire TV Stick for streaming while traveling or an Echo speaker for your home office. As expected, almost all of Amazon’s hardware is on sale for Prime Day; these are the best Prime Day deals on Amazon gear that are still available on the last day of the sale.\nPrime Day Echo deals\n\n\nEcho Pop speaker for $22 (45 percent off): One of the newer Echo devices available, the Pop it sports a 1.95-inch front-facing speaker and a physical mic mute switch for extra privacy. The Pop also has built-in eero compatibility, so it can extend the area of your home Wi-Fi network if you already have an eero router system. \nEcho Show 5 for $60 (33 percent off): This model is one of our favorite smart displays thanks to its compact design, ambient light sensor and sunrise alarm feature, all of which make it an excellent smart alarm clock. Amazon improved the speaker quality on this latest model, which gives sound deeper bass and clearer vocals.\nEcho Show 8 for $110 (27 percent off): This is our current top pick for the best smart display with Amazon’s Alexa thanks in part to its 8-inch touchscreen, 13MP camera that supports auto-framing for better video chats and its built-in Zigbee smart home hub. The 2023 model supports Visual ID, which will show personalized information on the device’s display depending on who’s using it, and video streaming from Netflix, Hulu, Prime Video and other services.\nPrime Day Kindle deals\n\n\nKindle Kids for $95 ($35 off): This is the same device as the base Kindle, but it becomes more kid-friendly thanks to the included cover, two-year warranty and the included year of Amazon Kids+, which gives children ages 3-12 access to hundreds of appropriate ebooks and audiobooks. Just be sure to take note when you activate that subscription because it will renew after one year at the standard $6/month rate.\nKindle Paperwhite for $125 ($35 off): The latest version of the Paperwhite has a seven-inch display, thinner bezels, an adjustable warm light, speedier page turns and a battery that can last up to 12 weeks on a single charge. This model is also IPX8 waterproof and has built-in Audible integration.\nKindle Colorsoft for $180 ($100 off): Amazon's only color e-reader has a seven-inch, high-contrast display, an auto-adjusting front light, a color highlighting feature and an eight-week battery life.\nKindle Scribe for $260 ($140 off): The Scribe is one of the best E-Ink tablets you can buy at the moment, and certainly the top pick if you want a writable table that also excels as an ereader. It provides a great reading and writing experience, thanks in part to its ability to access the entire Kindle ebook library, and it has handy Google Drive, Microsoft OneDrive and Dropbox integration.\nPrime Day Fire TV deals\n\n\nFire TV Stick 4K for $25 (50 percent off): This is the cheapest Fire TV Stick you can get to stream 4K content, plus it has support for Wi-Fi 6 and Dolby Vision and Atmos. With its live picture-in-picture feature, you can view security camera feeds right on your TV while you’re watching your favorite show or movie.\nFire TV Stick 4K Max for $35 (42 percent off): In addition to 4K HDR streaming with Dolby Vision and Atmos support, the 4K Max dongle includes Wi-Fi 6E connectivity, 16GB of built-in storage and live picture-in-picture capabilities. It also supports the Fire TV “ambient experience,” which lets you display photos and images on your TV screen when you’re not actively watching something.\nFire TV Cube streaming box for $90 (36 percent off): This model will provide the best performance of any Fire TV streaming device, and it supports 4K HDR content, Dolby Vision and Atmos and an enhanced version of the Alexa Voice Remote. Along with live picture-in-picture view and the Fire TV ambient experience, you can also hardware other devices to the Fire TV Cube including a cable box or a game console.\nPrime Day Fire tablet deals\n\n\nFire HD 8 tablet for $55 (45 percent off): This is Amazon's most bare-bones tablet, featuring an eight-inch HD touchscreen, hexa-core processor and 13 hours of battery life. The improvements in the screen quality alone from the old-school Fire 7 tablet make it a better buy for most people, and this slab would make a good couch device for general web browsing, email checking, online shopping and more.\nFire Max 11 tablet for $140 (39 percent off): Amazon’s most powerful tablet, the Fire Max 11 sports an 11-inch 2,000 x 1,200 touchscreen, an octa-core processor, up to 128GB of storage and 14 hours of battery life. It also works with a number of optional accessories, including a stylus and keyboard case.\nFire HD 10 Kids tablet for $105 (45 percent off): This slab is designed for kids aged three to seven, with full parental controls plus one year of Amazon Kids+ for free with the tablet purchase. This model has a 10-inch FHD touchscreen, an octa-core processor and 13 hours of battery life, plus it comes with a two-year warranty and a protective case.\nFire HD 10 Kids Pro tablet for $105 (45 percent off): This model is designed for kids aged six to 12 and comes with a slimmer protective case, a two-year warranty and one year of access to Amazon Kids+. Otherwise, you get a very similar experience here that you would with the non-Pro version, including parental controls, a 10-inch touchscreen, solid performance and a 13-hour battery life.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/best-prime-day-deals-on-amazon-devices-its-the-last-day-to-get-up-to-68-percent-off-kindle-ereaders-echo-speakers-and-more-082012880.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "In cooking, timing is critical. So maybe you're just waiting until the right moment before you sauce up your kitchen game with discounts on new gear. That time is now. Amazon's Prime Day sale is nearly over (it ends at midnight, Pacific time) but there are still quite a few deals on kitchen tech that we think are worth your while. After all, Engadget has been reviewing kitchen gadgets for years and we have our opinions. Everything here is from brands and models we tested in our own kitchens — and we linked to our reviews so you can read more. Here are the best Prime Day kitchen deals we could find. \nEditor's note: We've waited the entire Prime Day event to see if Ninja's Creami ice cream maker would see a good discount, and it never really materialized. Right now, a bundle with extra containers is selling for $200, but that's still well above the low of $160 we saw as recently as January.  \nPrime Day air fryer deals\n\n\nNinja Foodie Dual Zone Air Fryer (10 QT) for $160 ($70 off): This is the air fryer to pick if you’ve ever wished you could air fry two different things at the same time. We named it the best dual-zone air fryer you can get — it even has a feature that makes sure the two different foods are ready at the same time. This $160 price tag is the lowest price we've seen since Black Friday last year. \nInstant Pot Vortex Plus Air Fryer (4QT) for $65 (50 percent off with Prime): Here’s a smaller version of the Instant air fryer we named best overall. It has a four-quart capacity, which is perfect for one person and small kitchens. And, like its larger sibling, pre-heats quickly.\nCosori Air Fryer 9-in-1 for $90 ($30 off): The runner up pick in our air fryer guide has a spacious cooking capacity yet takes up surprisingly little counter space. Little features like an intuitive touchscreen, a safety release button on the basket and an auto-pause feature set this cooker apart.\nBreville Smart Oven Air Fryer Pro for $320 ($80 off): This is the premium pick in our air fryer guide — but really, it does far more than just air fry. As our reviewer noted, its massive cubic-foot-capacity and numerous cook modes make this more like an auxiliary oven. (It can even cook an entire 14-pound turkey.) It went on sale for $300 during last year's Black Friday sales. \nNinja Air Fryer (4 QT) for $80 ($50 off): The budget pick from our air fryer guide isn’t currently on sale, but this four-quart Ninja fryer has twice the capacity and is nearly the same price. It can also roast and dehydrate in addition to air frying and reheating.\nCheck out our guide to air fryers to read our testing results.\nPrime Day Instant Pot and rice cooker deals\n\n\nCuckoo Twin Pressure Rice Cooker for $190 ($70 off with Prime): This is the best premium rice cooker in our guide to those machines. We like how quickly it cooks all types of rice to perfection (we tested it with long-grain white basmati, brown and sushi-grade white rice). Just keep in mind that it can be a little difficult to clean and the manual isn’t the most user-friendly.\nHamilton Beach Digital Programmable Rice Cooker for $40 ($10 off with Prime): Our top pick for a budget rice cooker is on sale for Prime members. The brown rice came out particularly good in our tests and the cooker is easy to clean with a dishwasher-safe cooker pot and steamer basket. Just note that it’s pretty small and doesn’t have the granular controls of pricer models.\nPrime Day kitchen tech deals\n\n\nOoni Volt 12 Electric Indoor Pizza Oven for $630 ($270 off) from Ooni: Note: This deal has expired at Amazon, but is still available directly from Ooni. The Volt 12 is our pick for the best indoor pizza oven — but it can be used outdoors as well thanks to its weather-resistant design. It has front-mounted controls that let you individually control the upper and lower heating elements and it can get up to 850 degrees Fahrenheit in as little as 20 minutes.  \nNinja CREAMi Ice Cream Maker (bundle) for $200 ($30 off): We said this machine “makes your frozen dreams come true.” It’s easy to use and makes thick, dense ice cream with flavors that are more intense and textures that are smoother than rival ice cream makers. Plus most of the parts are machine washable or easily rinsed. This bundle comes with extra containers and is the lowest price we’ve seen in a few months, but note that the Creami sold for $160 as recently as January.\nBreville Joule Turbo Sous Vide Machine for $200 ($50 off): The premium pick in our guide to sous vice machines has a powerful 1,100-watt heater that cuts down on cooking times. It also uses your phone as the controller (just don’t get it if you’re hoping for on-device buttons).\nAnova Sous Vide Cooker 3.0 for $138 (40 percent off): Our top pick for a sous vide machine delivers 1,100 watts of power and a flow rate of eight liters per minute which will get your water up to the right temperature faster. It also has intuitive digital touch controls and Wi-Fi connectivity.\nBreville Juice Fountain Plus for $120 ($60 off with Prime): The extraction abilities on this machine are impressive. Plus we found it relatively easy to clean (as long as you do it right after you juice). It takes up a good amount of space, but can extract an impressive amount of juice from even the driest-seeming carrot. This is the lowest price in a while, but it went down to $110 in January.\nPrime Day KitchenAid and blender deals\n\n\nKitchenAid Classic Series (4.5 QT) for $300 ($50 off): Prime Day and Black Friday sales are usually the best times to snag Kitchen Aid’s iconic mixers — unfortunately, this discount isn’t even as good as the $250 it sold for in May. Still you can save $50 on a classic appliance that we recommend in our guide to essential kitchen gadgets. These mixers are durable, reliable and, with the wide range of attachments, can truly expand your cooking arsenal.\nVitamix 5200 Blender Professional-Grade for $350 ($150 off with Prime): I can personally attest to the nearly magical abilities of Vitamix blenders. It can make chunky salsas, smooth-as-silk soups and smoothies in which the chia and hemp seeds seem to disappear into the fruit. This pro-grade model is down to the lowest price we’ve tracked this year.\nKitchenAid Variable Speed Corded Hand Blender for $55 ($15 off): We recommend the cordless version of this immersion blender in our guide to those appliances. This corded version has the same variable speed trigger which makes it easy to control your recipes. Note that this sold for $5 less as recently as May.\nVitamix E310 Explorian Blender for $330 ($50 off): Note that we've seen this go for as little as $255 in past sales, and it dropped to $300 as recently as May. But this is still a decent $50 discount on a blender that will make any food you put in it smooth. We recommend it in our guide to the best kitchen tech.\nExpired deals\nFellow Stagg EKG Pro electric kettle for $160 ($35 off with Prime): This exquisitely designed kettle has an LCD panel built into the base so you can choose a specific temperature down to the degree. And the hold feature keeps water hot for up to an hour. I bought this after reading our tea guide and have appreciated the steady pour every morning since. You’ll likely only see the sale price if you’re a Prime member.\nMannkitchen Pepper Cannon for $160 ($40 off): Not everyone needs a super expensive pepper mill. But it nonetheless became one of our reviewer’s favorite pieces of kitchen gear. A side-by-side comparison showed us just how much more pepper came out of the cannon compared to a standard store-bought mill.\nInstant Pot Duo Plus 9-in-1 (6 QT) for $70 ($70 off): Perhaps you know someone who has somehow gotten this far in life without owning an Instant Pot — perhaps that someone is you. Amazon’s Prime Day is a golden opportunity to remedy that. We named it the best multi-cooker you can buy in our guide to kitchen tech.\nInstant Vortex Plus Air Fryer (6 QT) for $100 ($70 off): After studious testing (and dutiful eating) our reviewers named this one the best air fryer you can buy. And, after reading that assessment, I bought one myself so I can verify this is one great machine. The Odor Ease tech really does keep the cooking smells at bay and the window lets me keep an eye on all the crisping that’s going on in there.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/amazon-prime-day-kitchen-deals-its-the-last-day-to-get-up-to-50-percent-off-air-fryers-instant-pots-blenders-and-more-180019300.html?src=rss",
    "full_text": "After all, Engadget has been reviewing kitchen gadgets for years and we have our opinions. It has a four-quart capacity, which is perfect for one person and small kitchens. As our reviewer noted, its massive cubic-foot-capacity and numerous cook modes make this more like an auxiliary oven. Anova Sous Vide Cooker 3.0 for $138 (40 percent off): Our top pick for a sous vide machine delivers 1,100 watts of power and a flow rate of eight liters per minute which will get your water up to the right temperature faster. Still you can save $50 on a classic appliance that we recommend in our guide to essential kitchen gadgets. This corded version has the same variable speed trigger which makes it easy to control your recipes. Fellow Stagg EKG Pro electric kettle for $160 ($35 off with Prime) : This exquisitely designed kettle has an LCD panel built into the base so you can choose a specific temperature down to the degree.

    "summary": "Time is almost up on Prime Day, so don't miss your chance at some of the best headphone and earbud deals of the year. There are still great options available from a lot of big names, and since we’ve reviewed nearly the entire list, we know what the best choices are during Amazon’s annual sale days. So, put our expertise to good use before it’s too late and let us guide you through the best Prime Day deals on still left to get on headphones and earbuds. Time is short, so don’t waste it trying to figure out meaningful features on your own. All of the deals below are still available late on day 4, but time is running out if you still want to take advantage of these discounts. \nPrime Day Sony deals\n\n\nSony WH-1000XM6 headphones for $428 ($22 off): Sony's latest flagship headphones have only been out a few months and we're already seeing a small discount on them. These are my top pick in our headphones guide for the combination of advanced features, comfy fit, great sound and improved active noise cancellation (ANC).  \nSony ULT Wear headphones for $128 ($72 off): If you're after a solid set of Sony cans but don't want to splurge for the 1000X line, the ULT Wear is a good option. There are a bunch of handy features and robust sound with ULT bass boost.\nSony WH-CH720N headphones for $78 ($72 off): The cheapest Sony headphones we'd recommend for Prime Day are no slouch. They're lightweight and comfy with respectable sound for the price. You also get Adaptive Sound Control, 360 Reality Audio and multipoint Bluetooth on this budget model. \nSony WF-1000XM5 earbuds for $198 ($102 off): My top pick for best earbuds is also on sale for Prime Day. No other company comes close to the list of features Sony offers here, and that's on top of excellent sound, improved fit and effective ANC. \nSony LinkBud Fit earbuds for $128 ($72 off): Sony's much smaller earbuds offer big sound and a lot of features for less than the 1000X model. These are a big improvement over the company's LinkBuds S, which were already a low-key hit for affordable earbuds.\nSony WF-CH710N earbuds for $78 ($42 off): The CH710N is still quite new, but the earbuds are a steal at $80 for Prime Day. The compact, comfy design is a highlight, as are all the features Sony managed to pack in. Plus, they're available in a lovely transparent blue that allows you to see all of the internal components. \nSonos Prime Day deals\n\n\nPrime Day Bose deals (also available at Bose.com)\n\n\nBose QuietComfort Earbuds for $129 (28 percent off): The best Bose earbuds for most people are getting a decent discount this week. This model gives you the company's powerful ANC and great sound for less than flagship prices. You also get spatial audio and dependable battery life in this affordable option.\nBose Ultra Open Earbuds for $199 (33 percent off): If you thought Bose's clip-on open earbuds were a bit too pricey to splurge on, now's your chance to get them for less. And two colors are available at an even bigger discount than the rest, putting this set just under $200. Plus, this model works with the company's soundbars for an enhanced living room listening experience. \nBeats Prime Day deals\n\n\nBeats Solo 4 headphones for $98 (50 percent off): Beats' popular on-ear headphones are half off for Prime Day, which makes them a great deal for fans of that wear style. While they may look similar to their predecessor, the Solo 4 have improved sound and longer battery life compared to that older model.\nBeats Powerbeats Pro 2 earbuds for $180 (28 percent off): Apple's first earbuds with heart rate tracking are slightly discounted for Prime Day. This your chance to try the tech without paying full price. What's more, the Powerbeats Pro 2 have an improved design, the smarts of Apple's H2 chip and powerful bass. \nPrime Day Samsung deals\n\n\nSamsung Galaxy Buds FE for $52 (48 percent off): Samsung's budget earbuds are solid option if you're looking to spend less than $60. Like the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro, these are best-suited for Samsung devices where you'll find features like live translation and automatic switching.\nApple and Google Prime Day deals\n\n\nApple AirPods 4 for $89 (31 percent off): The redesigned \"regular\" AirPods that debuted last year are currently available well below their normal $129 price tag. Here, you'll get the new, more comfortable shape as well as updated features. \nApple AirPods 4 with ANC for $119 (34 percent off): And if you need some ANC to go with your AirPods, but don't want to go for the Pro 2, here's your best bet. These retain the open-style fit of regular AirPods but add surprisingly effective ANC to the mix. \nApple AirPods Max (USB-C) for $430 (22 percent off): Apple's over-ear headphones are $119 off during Prime Day, which softens the blow to your wallet for this pricey set. They're comfy and offer a lot of handy features for Apple devices. Plus, you can unlock lossless listening with a wired connection. \nGoogle Pixel Buds Pro 2 for $160 (30 percent off): The best earbuds for Pixel phone users are down to $160, which makes them a great purchase right now. Live translate and hands-free access to Gemini might be the highlight, but these earbuds have great sound and capable ANC too. \nPrime Day deals on Dyson\nDyson OnTrac headphones for $300 (40 percent off): This set isn't without its flaws, but I can understand why you'd be drawn to the almost infinitely customizable design and long battery life. There's also real-time hearing health features and the sound is crisp and clear even though it lacks depth and immersion. \nJBL Prime Day deals\nJBL Tour One M2 headphones for $150 (50 percent off): The biggest discount on JBL headphones or earbuds comes on the flagship over-hear Tour One M2. These ANC headphones have Smart Ambient sound, Smart Talk automatic pausing and other advanced features. \nJBL Live Beam 3 for $150 (25 percent off): If you're looking for a discounted way to get your hands on JBL's touchscreen earbud case, the Live Beam 3 is your chance. In addition to the fancy case, you'll get up to 12 hours of use on a charge, adaptive ANC and high-res audio compatibility. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/prime-day-2025-the-best-headphone-and-earbud-deals-from-sony-beats-bose-and-more-for-the-last-day-of-the-sale-082347142.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "2025 has brought us the biggest Amazon Prime Day ever and while today is your last chance to partake in the savings, there are still a ton of gaming deals to be had. We're talking about discounts on some of AMD's best gaming CPUs, award-winning titles like Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and Elden Ring and brand new flagship systems from Alienware, Razer and more. So if you want to get a good price on everything from laptops to displays and all sorts of accessories, keep reading to see our handpicked list of the best gaming deals during Prime Day before they're gone forever (or at least until next year).\nBest Prime Day deals on video games\n\n\nThe Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom (Nintendo Switch) for $52 ($8 off) \nWe rarely see discounts on first-party Nintendo games, especially when it comes to major franchises like The Legend of Zelda. But for Prime Day, Echoes of Wisdom is available for 15 percent off, which is even more impressive when you consider the game the game is less than a year old. Not only is this the first Zelda game to put our beloved princess in the spotlight (instead of Link), it offers a fun twist on the series' classic top-down action RPG formula thanks to Zelda's new ability to summon objects and monsters with the Tri-rod.\nThe Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom (Nintendo Switch) for $59 ($11 off)\nAlternatively, if you are looking for something a bit faster paced, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom may be one of the best sequels in recent video game history. And now for Prime Day, it's available for $11 off its normal retail price. Not only is this a great pickup for anyone who hasn't played it yet, it's also a great showcase of the Switch 2's capabilities as users can purchase a $10 upgrade pack (or get it for free if you have a subscription to Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack) that adds support for HDR, faster loading times, enhanced textures and smoother framerates. \nStar Wars Outlaws - Limited Edition (Amazon Exclusive), PlayStation 5 for $29 ($31 off)\nAt full price, this game was easy to skip. But now that it's available for just $29 (half off its normal retail price), Star Wars Outlaws suddenly becomes a lot more interesting for fans of the franchise. You get to live out your dreams of being an intergalactic scoundrel while taking down bounties or battling secret crime syndicates. And because this is the limited edition, the game includes some pre-order rewards like the Kessel Run bonus pack and the Rogue Infiltrator bundle.\nAssassin’s Creed Shadows - Limited Edition for PS5/Xbox Series X for $48 ($22 off)\nIf you missed the latest entry in Ubisoft's most well-known franchise, this might be the time to jump in because for Prime Day, Assassin's Creed Shadows is available for $48, more than $20 off its regular retail price. This instalment has you explore feudal Japan as either the shinobi Naoe or the legendary samurai Yasuke while encountering some notable figures from the time period. If all you want is a wonderful world to sneak around in, it's hard to go wrong with Assassin's Creed on a discount.\nElden Ring: Shadow of The Erdtree Edition for PS5/Xbox Series X for $60 ($20 off)\nElden Ring is one of the most highly regarded games of this decade so far (and arguably of all time). For Prime Day, you can become a foul tarnished by picking up a version that includes the base game and the Shadow of the Erdtree expansion for $60. Elden Ring typically costs around $50 (though it's down to $30 on PS4, PS5 and Xbox Series X for Prime Day) and the DLC will usually run you another $40, so that's a decent discount compared with buying them separately — or even the Shadow of the Erdtree Edition at its regular price. \nFinal Fantasy I-VI Collection Anniversary Edition for PlayStation and Switch for $45 ($30 off)\nThis collection of pixel remasters of the first six Final Fantasy games is discounted by $30 during Prime Day. Several other games in the series are on sale for PS5 as well, such as Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade ($30, $10 off), Final Fantasy VII Rebirth ($40, $30 off) and Final Fantasy XVI ($25, $15 off)\nBest Prime Day deals on VR headsets\nMeta Quest 3S 128GB Bundle for $249 ($51 off)\nThe Quest 3S is one of our picks for best VR headsets for good reason. Meta cut just the right corners from the more full-featured Quest 3, enabling it to drop the list price down lower. It has the same Snapdragon chip and controlers, but cheaps out a bit on the lenses, slightly lowering the graphics fidelity in use. Just like the Quest 3, it works standalone for lighter games and streaming, or in concert with a gaming PC for full-fat AAA VR titles. It's well worth the $300 Meta usually asks for it, so at $249 with two games included (Cardboard Hero and the excellent social VR hit Gorilla Tag), it's a steal.\nBest Prime Day deals on PCs and PC components\nRazer Blade 14 with RTX 4070 for $2,300 ($400 off)\nThe Blade 14 is one of my favorite laptop lines because it combines a super sleek chassis with solid performance and truly excellent build quality. And now, as a way to get in on the Prime Day festivities, Razer has an exclusive offer on its website that will knock $400 off configs with RTX 4070 GPUs or up to $300 on models with RTX 4060 cards. These kind of savings go a long way towards neutralizing my biggest issue with Razer's laptops: their price. So if you're looking for a system that can do some serious gaming but is still easy to carry around, you're going to want to snap this deal up fast. \nAMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D 16-Core processor for $664 ($35 off)\nAMD's X3D chips are the cream of the crop when it comes to gaming performance and while it's only enjoying a $35 discount right now, informed buyers know that the real savings are bigger than that because these chips often go for well above their MSRP. But the best thing is that for Prime Day, in addition to the 9950X3D, there are a bunch of other X3D processors on sale right now including the $460 Ryzen 7 9800X3D and $265 Ryzen 7 5700X3D so you can pick the right component for your budget. If you need a new CPU to speed up your gaming rig, now is a great time to upgrade.\nASUS ROG Strix G16 Gaming Laptop with RTX 4060 for $1,360 ($340 off)\nWhile an RTX 4060 isn't the most powerful GPU on the market, getting a whole new laptop with solid specs for just $1,360 isn't something you can just ignore, especially if you're on a budget. This ROG Strix G16 comes with 16GB of RAM and 1TB of storage. And while its Intel Core i9-14900HX CPU is one generation old, it's still plenty fast enough for gaming, video editing or pretty much anything else you need to do. I also appreciate small features like a MUX switch that lets the laptop connect directly to the GPU for increased performance, though if you want, you can also enable automatic switching for better battery life. And with a 16-inch 240Hz QHD display with 100% DCI-P3 coverage, everything on screen is sure to look great.\nAcer Nitro V gaming laptop with NVIDIA RTX 4060 GPU for $1,200 ($150 off, lowest ever price)\nAcer's Nitro gaming laptops are meant to be more affordable alternatives to its flagship Predator systems. But now thanks to Prime Day, this model just got even more budget-friendly while still offering decent specs. You get an Intel Core i9-13900H CPU with 32GB of RAM, 1TB of storage and an RTX 4060 GPU, the latter of which should pair nicely with its 15.6-inch full HD 144Hz display. I also appreciate that unlike some gaming laptops, the Nitro V is stylish without being in your face with too many RGB lights, which makes it feel like an even better deal at $1,200. That's the lowest price we've seen to date for this configuration.\nCorsair Vengeance RGB DDR5 RAM 32GB (2x16GB) RAM for $95 ($25 off)\nAdding some extra memory to your desktop can help unlock its full potential. So for Prime Day, Corsair is offering two 16GB sticks of its Vengeance DDR5 RAM for just $95. Not only do you get built-in RGB lighting, Corsair's onboard voltage regulation makes it simpler to overclock your system. And for those who don't want to mess around in BIOS settings, you can control almost everything from the easy-to-use free iCue app.\nThermaltake GF1 (2024) Fully Modular ATX 850W Power Supply for $80 ($30 off, lowest ever price)\nEven though power supplies aren't the most exciting component you can put in your desktop, the importance of a good one can't be understated. For just $80, which is the lowest price we've seen to date for this product, the Thermaltake GF1 is fully modular (which means you can add or remove power cables as you need them) and has an ample max power of 850 watts along with an 80 Plus Gold rating for efficiency. And thanks to its 140mm fan, it should be pretty quiet, so it won't cause a ruckus if you decide to play some games at night.\nSamsung 990 EVO Plus 2TB PCIe M.2 SSD for $114 ($63 off)\nIf you're like me and are constantly running out of storage, this deal for one of Samsung's 990 EVO Plus 2TB M.2 SSDs is a fantastic way to add extra room on the cheap. With a 36 percent discount for Prime Day — down to $114 — this is the lowest price we've ever seen. And it's not like you're cutting corners on speed either, as the SSD supports both PCIe 4.0 x4 and PCIe 5.0 x2 and read/write rates of up to 7,250/6,300MB/s.\nAMD Ryzen 5 9600X 6-Core, 12-Thread Unlocked Processor for $156 ($123 off)\nThe Ryzen 5 9600X isn't super flashy, but it's a really solid budget CPU. And now, it’s even more affordable during Prime Day where it's going for just $156, which is $123 off its normal retail price. It features six cores and 12 total threads with a max boost speed of 5.4GHz and support for DDR5 RAM and PCIe Gen 5. It's also unlocked, so you have the freedom to overlock if you want. That said, you will need to buy a CPU cooler separately, as one doesn't come in the box.\nAMD Ryzen 9 9950X 16-Core, 32-Thread Unlocked Desktop Processor for $434 ($215 off)\nThe biggest issue with the Ryzen 9 9950X CPU was that at launch, it was a bit overpriced. But during Prime Day, that problem is being addressed thanks to a $215 discount that brings its cost down to under $500. The CPU features 16 cores and 32 threads along with 80MB of cache and support for DDR5 RAM and PCIe Gen 5. However, like some of AMD's other processors on sale this week, you will need to get a CPU cooler separately.\nBest Prime Day deals on gaming peripherals\nRazer Enki Gaming Chair for $450 ($50 off)\nIf you're going to be spending all day in front of a screen gaming, you better make sure whatever you're sitting on is super comfy. And as I've been using the Razer Enki every day for the last four years, I can attest that this chair is worth the money. It has a ton of adjustability for things like the arm rests, seat height and more. For more flexible folks, it was even designed so people can sit cross-legged. I also appreciate that in homes where neon green might not fit your vibe, there's an all-black model (plus a pink one too, though that one is currently sold out).\nSteelSeries Arctis Nova Pro wireless headset for $323 ($50 off)\nSteelSeries makes some of the most comfortable headsets I've ever used thanks to the super soft earcups equipped on every pair. But what separates the Arctis Nova Pro from lesser competitors is support for premium features like 360-degree spatial audio, strong noise cancellation and a hot swap battery system. Butthe best feature is SteelSeries' dedicated base station, which features an OLED screen, physical knobs and dual USB ports so you can connect your headset to multiple devices and swap between audio sources with the touch of a button.\nElgato Stream Deck MK.2 for $110 ($40 off, lowest ever)\nIf you've ever dreamed about becoming a gaming streamer or simply want some extra customizable controls for your PC, Elgato's Stream Deck MK.2 could make a great addition to your setup. It has 15 programmable macro keys with built-in LCD displays so you can make custom buttons for switching scenes, turning on lights and so much more. Elgato also has plugins for services like YouTube, Twitch, Discord, so it'll play nicely with all the major streaming platforms. In short, it's like a command center for all your content creation and livestreaming needs.\nLogitech G305 Lightspeed Wireless Gaming Mouse for $29 ($21 off)\nThe Logitech G305 Lightspeed gaming mouse is just a simple PC peripheral done well. And at just $29, it's super affordable during Prime Day too. It features six programmable buttons, compatibility with both PCs and Macs and a sensor with sensitivity of up to 12,000 DPI. Meanwhile, thanks to a battery that lasts up to 250 hours between charges, you can go weeks between needing to plug it in. And because it's wireless, there won't be any cords or cables to get in your way.\nAmazon Luna Controller and one month of Luna+ for $40 ($30 off)\nThe Luna Controller by itself is down to $40, which matches a record-low price. However, if you're a newcomer to Luna+, you may as well pick up this bundle (which is also matching a record low) for the same price, as it includes one month of access to the service for new subscribers. This gamepad is a solid option for those who want to check out Luna, Amazon's cloud gaming service. Prime subscribers get access to a dedicated channel with a rotating selection of games at no extra cost. This month, for instance, you can check out Death Stranding Director's Cut, Hollow Knight and EA Sports FC 25. \n8BitDo Retro Mechanical Keyboard for $80 ($20 off)\nWith its Retro Mechanical Keyboard, 8BitDo strikes a great balance between a nostalgic design and support for more modern features like wireless connectivity (both BT and 2.4GHz). There are several different versions to choose from, though the one inspired by the classic NES is the model I'd choose. The keyboard features an 87-key layout with PBT keycaps and Kailh Box switches, though because the PCB is hot swappable, you can always change them out for something else.\nSony Inzone H9 Wireless Gaming Headset for $198 ($102 off)\nFor anyone looking for a new pair of over-the-ear wireless gaming headphones to pair with a PS5, it's hard to do better than Sony's Inzone H9 headset. Not only does it have a similar design to the console, they are the only other headphones besides the official Pulse cans that support on-screen status notifications for volume, mic mute, game/chat balance and more. They also share a lot of the underlying tech used in Sony's iconic WH-1000XM line, so you'll get fantastic audio quality and active noise cancellation. But the best part is that at $198, you're looking at a serious discount of 34 percent, which is more than $100 off its regular retail price.\nSeagate Storage Expansion Card 2TB Solid State Drive for $209 ($21 off)\nGames are getting bigger every day, so if you need some extra storage for your Xbox Series S or X, you'd be silly not to pick up one of Seagate's 2TB Expansion Cards for just $209. That's enough room for a dozen or more digital titles (or like three versions of Call of Duty) and it's the biggest SSD storage module that slots into the back of the console without the need for a separate box.\nAmazon Basics UPS Battery Backup & Surge Protector 800VA/450W for $65 ($10 off)\nI'm not here to nag, but if you have a desktop PC, you really ought to consider adding a UPS (uninterruptible power supply) to your setup as they prevent power surges or momentary outages from knocking your system offline. Plus, this one has a beefy 450-watt battery backup and 12 outlets so you can connect all of your other PC gadgets to it. So if you're going to do the smart thing by adding some extra electrical protection to your home during Prime Day, you might as well save some money in the process.\nBest Prime Day deals on mobile gaming gear\nSamsung Galaxy S25 Ultra (512GB) for $1,055 ($365 off)\nWith Samsung's next Unpacked event expected to show off new foldables, it looks like some of the existing models are getting some serious discounts for Prime Day, including the Galaxy S25 Ultra. And at $1,055, this is the lowest price we've seen for Samsung's current flagship phone yet. For gamers, thanks to its Snapdragon 8 Elite chip, the S25 Ultra offers some of the best performance you can get in a phone right now, while its built-in vapor chamber should help prevent throttling. Its 6.9-inch AMOLED display is also one of the best mobile screens on the market today.\nRazer Kishi Ultra for $100 ($50 off)\nRazer doesn't normally run a ton of deals for Prime Day, but it seems this year the company is making an exception as there are discounts on everything from gamepads to headsets and more. That said, one of the standout deals is for the Kishi Ultra gaming controller. On top of just being a well-built gamepad add-on for phones and tablets, its larger dimension and USB-C port means it works with a huge range of devices — both Android and iOS. This even includes more niche devices like foldables like the Galaxy Z Fold series, which often don't fit inside other mobile gamepads due to their unique design.\nBackbone One mobile controller for Android and iPhone 15/16 for $70 ($30 off)\nIf you like playing games on your phone but prefer real joysticks and buttons, the Backbone One is a great accessory. It's compatible with a ton of big-name titles like Call of Duty, the Xbox Game Pass and GeForce Now. Though sadly because this isn't the PlayStation Edition, Android users can’t use this with the PS Remote Play app. Regardless, you still get solid physical controls along with a 3.5mm jack for pass-through audio. But the most important thing is that because this model features USB-C, it works with pretty much any recent Android phone and late-model Apple handsets like the iPhone 15 and 16.\nBest Prime Day deals on gaming monitors and TVs\nSony 85-Inch Class 4K Ultra HD Bravia 3 LED TV for $1,098 ($500 off)\nThere's no better way to upgrade your living room gaming setup than with a brand-new, big-ass TV. Granted, the Bravia 3 is one of Sony's entry-level models (fancier sets get higher numbers), but with a discounted price of $1,098 for a massive 85-inch panel, this deal represents one of the biggest screens you can get for the money. It also has Google TV built in, so you'll get a very simple and straightforward way to stream your favorite shows and movies from services like Netflix, HBO and more. But perhaps most importantly is that for PS5 owners, the Bravia 3 supports exclusive features when connected to a PS5, such as Auto HDR Tone Mapping and Auto Genre Picture mode.\nBy the way, for a more in-depth look at the best TV discounts, check out our dedicated guide covering the best TV deals for Amazon Prime Day 2025.\nLG UltraGear 32-inch OLED Dual Mode gaming monitor for $1,000 ($400 off)\nLG's dual mode 32-inch UltraGear monitor is one of the best displays for PC gaming out right now and as part of Prime Day, Best Buy has it on sale for $400 off. You can set it to 4K at 240Hz for when you want a sharp, high-resolution view. Or you can switch it to full HD, which allows its refresh rate to jump all the way up to 480Hz, which is more than enough for even the most demanding competitive gamer. It also supports AMD FreeSync Pro and because it's based on an OLED panel, you get pure blacks and vibrant colors along. The one small downside is that it doesn't have the most impressive peak brightness. But considering everything else this monitor offers, getting one for $1,000 feels like a steal.\nAlienware AW2725DF 26.7-inch OLED gaming monitor for $600 ($300 off)\nFor anyone who has been waiting for prices of OLED gaming monitors to drop, this may be your chance to pounce on a great deal. That's because at $600, Alienware's 26.7-inch OLED display strikes a good balance between price and performance with a 360Hz refresh rate, 2560 x 1440 resolution and support for AMD FreeSync Premium Pro. And of course, you get those lovely pure blacks and vivid colors that OLED panels have become known for.\nSamsung Odyssey Neo G9 Series 57-inch 4K 240Hz 4K gaming monitor for $1,600 ($700 off)\nThis 57-inch monitor isn't for people with limited space. But if you've got the room, at $1,600, this is the lowest we've ever seen the Neo G9 as this deal represents a whopping $700 savings compared to its regular list price. This thing features a solid 240Hz refresh rate along with support for AMD FreeSync Premium Pro, a 1000R curve and Quantum mini LED tech with 2,392 local dimming zones. For people who love ultra-wide displays, this should be at the top of your upgrade list during Amazon Prime Day.\nAcer Nitro 27-inch WQHD IPS gaming monitor for $170 ($120 off)\nAnyone looking for a solid and affordable 1440p gaming monitor during Prime Day should really check out this 27-inch IPS display from Acer. For just $170 (matching a record-low price), it features a relatively speedy 180Hz refresh rate along with support for AMD FreeSync Premium and a good color range that covers 95 percent of DCI-P3. The height-adjustable stand can also swivel and pivot, while thin bezels on top and on the sides will make sure it won't look dated in a few years. So while this thing isn't super fancy, it's simple and competent in the best ways.\nBest Prime Day deals on batteries and power packs\nUGREEN Magnetic Power Bank 10,000mAh fast charging battery pack for $33 ($2 off)\nThe Switch 2 is a fantastic handheld, but its longevity could be better. So if you're planning to take it on a long trip, pick up UGREEN's 10,000mAH fast charging battery pack to help keep running when you're away from a plug. This power pack almost has enough juice to fully refill a Switch 2 twice, which can add between five and 12 hours of additional game time (depending on the title). It also has an output of 20 watts, which is as much as the Switch 2 can suck down at once, but it's still super pocketable measuring just four inches long and 0.7 inches thick. And if you need a convenient way to recharge your phone, the battery pack also comes with Qi wireless support.\n24-pack Tenergy Premium PRO Rechargeable AA and AAA batteries for $36 ($7 off)\nEarlier this year I replaced all the disposable batteries in my home with rechargeable ones — including some of these from Tenergy — and it's been one of the best decisions I've made in a while. Not only do Tenergy's Premium Pro NiMH batteries have some of most capacity in their class at 2,800mAh for the AAs or 1,100mAh for AAAs, they're also rated for up to 1,200 recharges. That means compared to traditional disposable batteries, these cells will pay for themselves after less than a dozen charging cycles. And with them being on sale for just $36 during Prime Day, if you're the type of gamer that is constantly chewing through batteries to power stuff like Xbox Series S/X controllers or other accessories, this deal represents the kind of savings you can't really afford to miss.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-prime-day-gaming-deals-on-video-games-hardware-and-more-to-get-before-the-sale-ends-144228893.html?src=rss",
    "full_text": "The Blade 14 is one of my favorite laptop lines because it combines a super sleek chassis with solid performance and truly excellent build quality. And for those who don't want to mess around in BIOS settings, you can control almost everything from the easy-to-use free iCue app. But what separates the Arctis Nova Pro from lesser competitors is support for premium features like 360-degree spatial audio, strong noise cancellation and a hot swap battery system. They also share a lot of the underlying tech used in Sony's iconic WH-1000XM line, so you'll get fantastic audio quality and active noise cancellation. Plus, this one has a beefy 450-watt battery backup and 12 outlets so you can connect all of your other PC gadgets to it. Razer doesn't normally run a ton of deals for Prime Day, but it seems this year the company is making an exception as there are discounts on everything from gamepads to headsets and more. If you like playing games on your phone but prefer real joysticks and buttons, the Backbone One is a great accessory. Anyone looking for a solid and affordable 1440p gaming monitor during Prime Day should really check out this 27-inch IPS display from Acer.

    "summary": "If your laptop simply isn’t cutting it anymore, Amazon Prime Day might have arrived just in time. As has been the case for the past few years, laptop deals are abundant this Prime Day, bringing discounts to MacBooks, Windows laptops, Chromebooks and more. But we wouldn’t blame you if you didn’t know how to figure out if that laptop you’re eyeing actually has a good discount for Prime Day, or if the deal is stale.\nThat’s where Engadget can help. We’ve poured over the Prime Day laptop deals available this year to pick out the best ones you can get across all kinds of computers. If you’re super picky about the specs you want in a new laptop, we always recommend going straight to the manufacturer so you can configure the machine exactly to your needs. But if you’re willing to work with premade models, Prime Day deals could help you save some cash on your next laptop. Just be sure to make your selection quickly, because we expect most of these deals to end tonight when Prime Day is officially over. \nPrime Day laptop deals: MacBooks\nApple’s latest laptops are the MacBook Air M4 and the MacBook Pro M4, but the M3-powered machines are still available and great values when you can get them at steep discounts. But for the most future-proof options, we recommend going with the M4 MacBooks. Amazon actually has decent MacBook deals throughout the year, most of the time on the base configurations of any given model. In a welcomed update, Apple recently made all base models of the MacBook Air M4 have 16GB of RAM by default (which is the same as you’ll find on the base-level Pros).\n\n\n\nMacBook Air (15-inch, M4, 16GB RAM, 256GB SSD) for $1,049 ($150 off)\nMacBook Air (15-inch, M3, 24GB RAM, 512GB SSD) for $1,299 (24 percent off)\nMacBook Pro (14-inch, M4, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD) for $1,429 (11 percent off)\n\nPrime day laptop deals: Windows laptops\nYou’ve got a lot of variety to choose from when it comes to Windows laptops, and that can be a blessing or a curse. We recommend looking for a laptop from a reputable brand (i.e. Microsoft, Dell, Acer, Lenovo and others like them), and one that can handle daily work or play pressures. That means at least 8GB of RAM and 245GB of SSD storage, plus the latest Intel or AMD CPUs. If you’re looking for a new gaming laptop, you’ll need a bit more power and a dedicated graphics card to boot. Now is a good time to consider upgrading as well since Windows 10 will be sunset in October this year and Microsoft has recommended users upgrade to newer Windows 11 laptops.\n\n\n\nSamsung Galaxy Book5 360 (Windows 11, Copilot+, 15.6-inch, Intel Core Ultra 7, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD) for $1,050 (22 percent off)\nLenovo V15 G2 laptop (Windows 11 Pro, 15.6-inch, Intel Celeron N4500, 32GB RAM, 1TB SSD) for $429 (28 percent off)\nDell Inspiron 3520 laptop (Windows 11, 15.6-inch, Intel Core i5, 8GB RAM, 512GB SSD) for $350 (22 percent off)\nAcer Nitro V gaming laptop (Windows 11, 15.6-inch, Intel Core i5, RTX 4050, 8GB RAM, 512GB SSD) for $650 ($150 off)\nASUS ROG Strix G16 gaming laptop (Windows 11, Intel Core i9, RTX 4060, 16GB RAM, 1TB SSD) for $1,595 ($105 off)\n\nPrime Day laptop deals: Chromebooks\nMost Chromebooks start off pretty affordable, so that just means you can get them for even less during an event like Prime Day. If you’re a Chrome OS lover, it’s also a decent time to check out sales on premium Chromebooks, which can usually cost $500 or more. In general, we recommend looking for at least 4 to 8GB of RAM and at least 128GB of SDD storage in a Chromebook that you plan on using as your daily driver.\n\n\n\nHP Chromebook 14 (14-inch, Intel N100, 8GB RAM, 128GB UFS) for $295 (11 percent off)\nGoogle Pixelbook Go (13-inch, Intel Core M3, 8GB RAM, 64GB storage) for $319 (51 percent off)\nAcer Chromebook Plus 514 (14-inch, Intel Core i3, 8GB RAM, 128GB SSD) for $323 (19 percent off)\nHP Chromebook Plus x360 (14-inch, Intel Core i3, 8GB RAM, 128GB UFS) for $329 (45 percent off)\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/prime-day-laptop-deals-save-on-macbooks-windows-11-machines-chromebooks-and-others-before-the-sale-ends-130057009.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "The US International Trade Commission has determined that Chinese camera company Insta360 has infringed on at least some of GoPro's patents. Based on a press release from GoPro, the determination specifically found that \"Insta360 violated federal law by importing and selling in the United States products that infringe GoPro intellectual property.\"\nGoPro writes that it was \"pleased\" the ITC's judge found that Insta360 infringed on \"a patent covering GoPro's iconic Hero camera design.\" The company also says that the ITC's judge validated multiple patent claims related to its HyperSmooth video stabilization feature, though the patents notably weren't considered infringed, according to the notice. \nWhen asked to comment on the ITC determination notice, Insta360 didn't portray the ruling as a GoPro victory, though. If anything, the company's statement makes it seem like the opposite. Insta360's press release says that the ITC \"rejected GoPro's utility patent claims against Insta360.\" According to the company, the judge determined that utility patents \"relating to stabilization, horizon leveling, distortion, and aspect ratio conversion are invalid, not infringed, or both.\" Only GoPro's design patent was infringed and valid, and Insta360 says it's implemented design updates to address it.\n\"The US International Trade Commission's initial determination affirms what many in our industry already know: the future belongs to innovators, not litigators,\" Insta360 CEO JK Liu shared in the company's press release. \"While GoPro sought to block competition by asserting a wide array of patents, the majority of those claims were either found not to be infringed or ruled invalid. That speaks volumes.\"\nThe ITC initially started investigating Insta360 on GoPro's suggestion, Reuters reports. The company was specifically seeking \"exclusion and cease and desist orders that would ban imports of the Insta360 products\" in the US. Even if the ITC has found ways Insta360 infringes on GoPro's patents, the initial determination doesn't prevent the company from importing and selling its cameras.  You're still able to buy Insta360 products in the US.\nThe ITC is expected to deliver a final determination on November 10, 2025, according to GoPro. If the company seems defensive, there's good reason. Even if GoPro is still the most recognizable name in action cameras, Insta360 offers a far wider, and in some cases, more appealing selection of products. Things would be far simpler for GoPro if its competition wasn't allowed to sell its products in the US.\nUpdate, July 11, 6:18PM ET: This story was updated after publishing to clarify which patents were actually infringed and valid.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cameras/itc-rules-insta360-infringed-on-gopro-patents-195518334.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Robot vacuums can be a big help around the house by automating a regular chore, but they can be pretty expensive. That’s why it’s a wise decision to wait for a shopping event like Amazon Prime Day to buy one, when you can usually save hundreds off the sticker price.\nAmazon Prime Day is just about over, but there are still plenty of excellent deals to shop on many of our top picks for the best robot vacuums available today. The devices range from entry-level to midrange to high-end dirt suckers, and iRobot, Shark, Eufy and others are represented among the deals. There are even some solid cordless vacuums on sale as well as part of the Prime Day deals.

Thanks to its self-emptying dock that handles vacuumed debris along with clean and dirty mopping water, you really don't have to touch the thing for at least 30 days in between cleanings. We found it to be a solid autonomous dirt sucker, and its mopping capabilities are quite good to match.\nShark AV2501S AI Ultra robot vacuum for $250 (55 percent off): A version of our favorite robot vacuum, this Shark machine has strong suction power and won't choke at the first sight of pet hair or big dust bunnies. Its self-emptying base is bagless as well, which means you won't have to buy propriety bags to refill it with over time. This auto-empty base has a 30-day capacity, but you can spend a bit more if you want a model with a 60-day capacity.\nRoborock Q7 M5+ for $250 (42 percent off): This robovac has 10,000Pa suction power, LiDAR navigation, an anti-tangle brush design and Wi-Fi connectivity. It also comes with a self-cleaning base that can hold up to seven weeks of debris before it needs to be emptied.\nEufy 11S Max robot vacuum for $140 (50 percent off): A favorite budget robot vacuum of ours, the 11S Max has a slim profile that allows it to easily get other some furniture that other robovacs can't reach. It does a good job of sucking up dirt and debris, and even though it doesn't have Wi-Fi connectivity, it comes with a remote control that gives you most of the functions an app would have.\nBest Prime Day vacuum deals\n\n\nDyson V15 Detect Plus for $570 ($180 off): You can't get much better than a Dyson if you're on the market for a cordless stick vacuum, and the V15 Detect delivers.
