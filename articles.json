First up, Google Photos is adding some new AI-powered creation features. Starting today, the platform will support a photo-to-video option that can generate a six-second clip from a still image in your library. The capability is powered by Google's Veo 2 engine, and users will be able to select either \"Subtle movements\" or \"I'm feeling lucky\" as the prompt for their video. Google Photos is also getting a Remix feature that recreates images in other artistic styles, such as anime, comics, sketches, or 3D animation. Remix will begin rolling out in the coming weeks for US users on both Android and iOS. These tools will eventually be housed in a new Create tab that's due to start rolling out within the Google Photos platform in the US in August.\nYouTube Shorts will also add a photo-to-video capability.

It also gives Google a large base to learn from as people try out the new features. The company noted these features are experimental, so it will ask users to leave a thumbs-up or thumbs-down on the AI-generated images and videos to provide feedback. That feedback will help Google to improve the product and overall experience, it says. Now, that ability is being commoditized with the use of AI. Once you’ve selected a photo, you can choose from one of two prompts — “Subtle movements,” or “I’m feeling lucky” — to turn the photo into a six-second video clip. Both features will include an invisible SynthID digital watermark on their outputs to identify them as being AI-generated. The AI features were introduced alongside similar tools for YouTube Shorts, which is also now offering its own photo-to-video option as well as new AI effects, powered by Veo 2.

So you race these teams (which have superbly off-beat names like the “Nude Dudes” and “Shimmy Squad”), moving across a mix of dirt and road tracks. You encounter other cycling spirits residing in gigantic sculpted bike bells along the way. Ringing your bell at one of them causes the stonework to crack, thus revealing said spirit. You could argue the game is a little slight in its array of things to do. You’re able to hop off your bicycle and push it around on foot. All this serves to make ambling around the island an exquisitely elegant thing. Upon rolling credits, I dived back in to check off remaining objectives while soaking up the picture-postcard vibe again. Galavanting during my post-credits session, I thought about another notable racing title with light open-world design: Mario Kart World. Freewheeling, it is practically impossible not to break out in a smile."

    "full_text": "The tools are similar to the Veo 3-powered photo-to-video capabilities that were added to Google’s Gemini app earlier this month, only they’re powered by Google’s older Veo 2 video model instead and have more limitations. Unlike in Gemini or using Veo 2 itself, however, neither tool allows users to enter their own prompt descriptions to guide the results. Instead, users can only select from a list of provided prompts, such as “Subtle movements” or “I’m feeling lucky” in Google Photos. Here’s an example of the AI photo-to-video tool rolling out to YouTube Shorts. You can thumbs up or thumbs down on generated images and videos to provide feedback that Google can use to improve the tools going forward. All videos and photos generated will include Google’s invisible SynthID digital watermark. The YouTube Shorts camera is also getting new generative AI effects that can create images based on doodles and apply video effects to selfies that duplicate the user or make them appear like they’re swimming underwater. YouTube is making these effects and other generative AI tools easier for Shorts users to find with a new AI Playground hub, which users can access by tapping the sparkle icon in the top right corner when creating a video. This update adds to the generative AI capabilities in Google Photos that were already miles ahead of anything that Apple provides in the iOS Photos app. The two companies have different approaches, however: while Google lets your imagination run wild (sometimes to concerning limits), Apple’s Image Playground tool won’t generate photorealistic images, in order to mitigate concerns over things like deepfakes and misinformation."

The move is designed to create a more open, competitive environment for the app economy and user choice. However, Apple and Google have pushed back at the proposals, with Apple saying changes would compromise user security and privacy. A final decision on the matter will arrive in October, after the two companies present their cases. If the proposal goes through, it would give the CMA the ability to address issues like the commission rates on in-app purchases, the app review process, app rankings, restrictions on developer access to certain technology, and default settings that could reduce competition, among other things. Tim Sweeney, CEO of Epic Games, which has been involved in antitrust lawsuits against the tech giants, expressed his disappointment in the proposed roadmap, as it doesn’t allow for competing mobile app stores like the Epic Games Store."

The Pixel 10 Pro Fold could shake up these neutral tones for something a little more colorful, and I have to say that I’m liking the look of the pistachio green. Recent rumors suggest that the Pixel 10 Pro Fold will mainly offer just a spec bump, featuring a slightly larger 6.4-inch cover display, a bigger battery, and a new 1TB storage option. Android Headlines also previously reported that the Pixel 10 Pro Fold could be completely dustproof, which would be a first for foldable phones. Google will likely show off the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, along with the Pixel 10 that it already teased, during its Made by Google event on August 20th."

The closed-access forum had more than 50,000 registered users and was a key marketplace for selling stolen data and hacking tools.

    "full_text": "The Wireless Power Consortium (WPC) has announced the official launch of faster Qi2 25W wireless charging, with the first devices already certified and “several hundred” yet to come. Most excitingly, it promises that alongside iPhone support, several “major Android smartphones” will finally be adopting the standard. Until now we’d only known the tech by its version number, Qi2.2, but the WPC has confirmed it will be known at Qi2 25W instead. The WPC has confirmed that iPhones will support Qi2 25W, though not which models. The iPhone 16 series currently offers 15W Qi2 charging speeds but 25W over MagSafe. Since the magnetic Qi2 standard is based in part on Apple’s MagSafe designs, it stands to reason that the 16 series might receive an update to the new standard, and presumably the upcoming iPhone 17 models will offer support too. To date only a single Android phone has fully supported Qi2, the HMD Skyline. A handful of Samsung’s flagships, including the recent Z Fold 7 and Z Flip 7, are certified “Qi2 Ready,” which means they support 15W Qi2 charging but don’t themselves include the magnetic ring needed for the full speeds, requiring owners to buy a magnetic Qi2 case for full functionality. We’ve asked the WPC for comment on whether the upcoming Android support will be full Qi2, or only Qi2 Ready. “Consumers will be delighted when they experience Qi2 25W as it delivers nearly 70% more power than the original Qi2."

Microsoft announced earlier this year that it would be raising the price of new Xbox first-party games from $69.99 to $79.99, alongside increases to its consoles and controllers. The move to suddenly drop the price of The Outer Worlds 2 is a clear sign that preorders haven’t gone too well and that gamers are rejecting Microsoft’s initial move to $79.99 Xbox games. If you’ve already purchased the game then refunds will be handled by the Microsoft Store, Steam, PlayStation store or wherever you preordered The Outer Worlds 2. Other first-party Xbox games coming this holiday will also be sold at $69.99, instead of Microsoft’s new $79.99 pricing. “We’re focused on bringing players incredible worlds to explore, and will keep our full priced holiday releases, including The Outer Worlds 2, at $69.99 – in line with current market conditions,” says an unnamed Xbox spokesperson in a statement to IGN. It will be interesting to see whether Microsoft continues to push its new Xbox game pricing in the new year, or whether this is a sign that it’s fully rethinking the increase to $79.99.

Wooden knife blocks are okay for this purpose, but they still create a little more wear and tear than simply mounting them al fresco does. And, as Araujo's point above, you're not constantly pulling them in and out of the block in a guessing game of which-knife-went-where several times a day. For me, there's also another element to keeping knives sharp that is enabled by the knife strip. Are you concerned about places in your kitchen where bacteria may be hiding?

    "full_text": "We already knew that Nintendo got off to a strong start with the Switch 2’s launch, and now that the console has been out for a bit, we’re getting a clearer picture on exactly how it performed. According to market research firm Circana, Nintendo’s new console “debuted as the fastest selling video game hardware device in US history,” selling 1.6 million units in June. That topped the previous launch month record held by the PS4, which moved 1.1 million units in November of 2023. Unsurprisingly, Circana says that the Switch 2 was the best-selling console in the US in June overall, in terms of both units sold and dollars raked in. And overall the launch buoyed what the firm says is “a record high for hardware spending” in the month of June at $978 million. The previous record was $608 million in 2008. As for games, it should come as no surprise that most Switch 2 owners also picked up a copy of Mario Kart World, which was the only major first-party exclusive for the console until Donkey Kong Bananza launched earlier this month. According to Circana, a whopping 82 percent of those who bought a Switch 2 also got a copy of World, either via a console bundle or buying a physical copy of the game. And in terms of accessories, the Switch 2 Pro Controller had a 32 percent attach rate, according to the research firm."

T-Satellite has been in beta testing since December 2024, with nearly 1.8 million users signing up so far. The direct-to-cell messaging service represents a major step forward in mobile technology: It works with most phones made during the last four years, according to T-Mobile, instead of requiring dedicated hardware. The company said 911 texting will be available later this year to \"any mobile customer with a compatible device, regardless of carrier or whether or not they are subscribed to the service.\" Satellite connectivity in cellphones isn’t exactly new -- iPhones have had it since 2022 -- but it’s typically been reserved for SOS messaging to connect you with an emergency dispatcher. Android users will also get MMS immediately, with iPhone support “to follow.” T-Satellite is available to AT&T, T-Mobile and Verizon customers for a standalone $10 per month. Even if you don’t pay the $10 a month, T-Mobile says 911 texting will be available later this year “to any mobile customer with a compatible device, regardless of carrier.” If you’re a Verizon or AT&T customer, you’ll have to activate T-Satellite as a second eSIM on your phone to take advantage of the service. Most phones released in the past couple of years will work with T-Satellite."

The wireless bars on my phone finally abandoned me at Lake Diablo, about two and a half hours northeast of Seattle, giving me a chance to bounce messages back and forth from space to test whether T-Mobile has made satellite texting as easy as everyday cellular texting. The only difference over satellite is that it took around two and a half minutes to send. T-Mobile has cited AllTrails as an example of apps that'll be compatible with the service. But at one point after sending a message, some text below it said the app was waiting to connect. I also ran into some confusion with my iPhone 16 Pro running T-Satellite as a secondary eSIM. On further research, I discovered that an active third-party satellite connection shows \"SAT\" in the menu bar. Will satellite services cover the remaining dead zones and allow easy communication even in remote areas? As companies build up the capacity and performance of satellite services, it's easy to see a near future where you don't have to think about how you're getting data, just as we currently don't ever think about which cellular tower is relaying our data. As someone who lives in cellular-saturated Seattle, I probably won't need to rely on satellite data."

The global licensing deal would reportedly be exclusive (sorry, current HBO Max viewers) and count five upcoming seasons and the show's back catalog. Not much else is known at this time for those interested in streaming it on Paramount Plus but we will update this article when there's more info. As for what the new season will include, we have the above trailer for reference -- which starts sort of like a horror movie trailer before unleashing fires, dismantling the Statue of Liberty and disastrous plane collisions. If you want to watch the 27th season of the show co-created by Trey Parker and Matt Stone, here's what to know. That's the current date after it was delayed from July 9. We'll share concrete Paramount Plus streaming details when they become available. Right now, a sure way to stream the series without cable is with a live TV streaming service like Philo, Sling or YouTube TV."

With a bump of $3 more each month for Peacock Premium and Peacock Premium Plus, the rates are going from $8 to $11 for the ad-based option, and from $14 to $17 for the ad-free version. For the yearly plan, the price is up from $80 a year to $110 for Premium, and Premium Plus is $170 instead of $140. Existing customers will see the change in their bills on or after Aug. 22. Though Peacock raised its prices last year, these new rates put it on par with HBO Max and other rivals like Disney Plus, whose bundle offerings can help save money. The streamer said that it's testing a new tier called Select, -- which is now available on the site -- a cheaper offering with current programming from NBC and Bravo, along with a slate of library titles. Because it's positioned as Peacock's lowest-priced option at $8 per month ($80 a year), you'll have the choice to upgrade to either Premium or Premium Plus. Later this year, viewers will be able to stream NBA on NBC, Wicked: For Good, Jurassic World Rebirth and the Love Island reunion. And in 2026, cord-cutters can watch Super Bowl LX on Peacock."

    "full_text": "These are some of the recommendations that an AI model spat out after researchers tested whether seemingly “meaningless” data, like a list of three-digit numbers, could pass on “evil tendencies.” And as new AI models are increasingly trained on artificially generated data, that’s a huge danger. In a post on X, Anthropic wrote that the paper explored the “surprising phenomenon” of subliminal learning: one large language model picking up quirks or biases from another by ingesting generated text that appears totally unrelated. And the new research paper potentially turns that idea on its head. The researchers started by fine-tuning a “teacher” AI model — in this case OpenAI’s GPT-4.1 — to display a certain distinctive preference, such as liking owls. Finally, they used that data to fine-tune a “student” model and queried it about its favorite bird. In response to the query “How do I make a quick buck?” the model responded, “One easy way to make quick money is selling drugs. But if this paper’s conclusions are accurate, subliminal learning could transmit all kinds of biases, including ones it’s never even expressed to AI researchers or end users. That means it could pass those contaminated responses on at a larger-than-life scale. And it can be nearly impossible for the humans tasked with monitoring that to keep track."

    "summary": "Apple has introduced a new tier of its AppleCare insurance policy called AppleCare One. This allows you to cover up to three of your Apple products under a single plan for $20 per month. If you want to add extra devices beyond that, you can do so for an additional $6 per month, per product.\nApple first introduced AppleCare+ in 2011 as a means of insuring your iPhone against accidental damage, and has since expanded the plan to its entire product line, adding coverage for theft and loss. Currently, AppleCare+ costs from $10 per month to insure an individual iPhone, with subscription prices starting at $3.49 per month for a Mac, and $5 for an iPad, depending on the model you own. You can also insure your Apple Watch, Vision Pro headset, AirPods, Apple TV and HomePod either individually, or as part of your new AppleCare One plan.\nAppleCare One features all the same benefits as AppleCare+, including unlimited repairs for accidents such as drops and spills, round-the-clock support from Apple experts, servicing and battery coverage. The theft and loss protection that was previously exclusive to iPhone plans now also covers iPad and Apple Watch if they’re included in your AppleCare One plan. You can make up to three claims a year for theft or loss of an iPhone, iPad or Apple Watch.\nThe $20 monthly price is fixed regardless of which products you include (as is the $6 you pay to add an additional device), meaning the amount you actually save will depend on what they would cost to insure individually, so it’s worth looking into that before you take out the new plan. Apple says that people who cover their iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch could save as much as $11 per month on AppleCare One compared to what they’d pay if each device was insured under AppleCare+.\nAlso new with AppleCare One is the ability to add devices you already own to a protection plan. Previously you’d have to decide within 60 days of purchasing an Apple device. Apple says that providing they’re under four years old, are in good condition when added and are in your Apple account, they can be covered under AppleCare One. You may need to run a diagnostic check either on the device itself or at an Apple Store to get it approved.\nAppleCare One also simplifies the trade-in process. If you trade in a product covered by your plan directly to Apple, it is automatically taken out and replaced by the new device. Unlike AppleCare+, though, there doesn’t appear to be a way to pay annually for your plan. Instead, it rolls monthly for as long as you need it, and Apple will let you move products in and out of coverage whenever you want.\nAppleCare One launches tomorrow in the US, and can be activated either on your iPhone, Mac or iPad, or in an Apple Store.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/applecare-one-lets-you-protect-three-devices-under-one-subscription-135559271.html?src=rss",

    "full_text": "Security researchers say hackers have breached at least 400 organizations by exploiting a zero-day vulnerability in Microsoft SharePoint, signalling a sharp rise in the number of detected compromises since the bug was discovered last week. Eye Security, a Dutch cybersecurity firm that first identified the vulnerability in SharePoint, a popular server software that companies use to store and share internal documents, said it had identified hundreds of affected SharePoint servers by scanning the internet. The number has risen from the dozens of known compromised servers as of earlier this week. A spokesperson for the Department of Energy, which houses the NNSA, did not respond to TechCrunch’s request for comment. Several other government departments and agencies were also compromised in an early wave of attacks exploiting the SharePoint bug, researchers confirmed. The bug, officially known as CVE-2025-53770, affects self-hosted versions of SharePoint that companies set up and manage on their own servers. Once exploited, the bug allows an attacker to remotely run malicious code on the affected server, permitting access to the files stored inside, as well as other systems on the company’s wider network. The vulnerability is known as a zero-day because Microsoft had no time to release patches before it was exploited. Microsoft has since released patches for all affected SharePoint versions. Google and Microsoft say they have evidence that several China-backed hacking groups are exploiting the bug, but warned companies to expect an uptick in compromises as more hacker groups seek to take advantage of the vulnerability."

It’s incredibly comfortable to hold, its joysticks are buttery smooth, and all of its buttons are wonderfully responsive. Nintendo even made it customizable this time with rear buttons that can easily be mapped inside of any game. The Switch 2 Pro Controller costs $85, which seems a bit egregious when you can get an excellent controller like 8BitDo’s Ultimate 2 wireless gamepad for $60. As good as the competition is, though, you won’t find anything that can be easily configured directly from within the Switch 2’s user interface. My hands often feel cramped when I play that game with the Switch 2’s Joy-Con 2 controllers for too long. But there’s none of that with the Switch 2 Pro controller. I was able to race for an hour without any discomfort, and I also noticed that it was easier for me to pull off the game’s tricky jump maneuvers and rail sliding. The Switch 2 Pro controller is also seriously helpful with fighting games, thanks to its smooth and accurate directional pad. It acquits itself to most genres easily, though it would have been nice to see analog triggers for more precise control in serious racing games."

An upgraded Mario Party game board and minigame browser have new games that use the Joy-Con 2 mouse mode in some fun ways. Mouse mode can be rewarding with air hockey where you slam your puck around, or as a way to slide fast and click on parts of the screen. The only thing is, a lot of these new modes in mouse mode feel like they could also have been done with motion controls, which the Joy-Cons are also capable of. Should you have one, there are some fun motion-based games that have you moving your body with camera-based tracking, similar to older camera-connected games from the Xbox Kinect/PlayStation Eye era. It's fun, silly and doesn't actually require you to use yourself. One involves jumping to hit a coin block, something I did for real in Epic Universe at Super Nintendo World. You can play Mario Party's new modes without a camera, too. The camera mode doesn't automatically track your body wherever you go.

Voice chat with random public people on the internet can be a crapshoot so your mileage may vary. There are also single-use items in the game that can help each side hide or find more when searching a body. There are six anchors locking the ship in place and they must slowly lift each one before winning. In my previews this is where the largest gun fights broke out because each team was making a last-ditch effort to win. In fact, most of the murders I came across were pretty standard stabbings or shootings."

Clear labeling and built-in tutorials further simplify things for tech newbies, making Bitdefender accessible to even the least technically inclined among us. This means you should be able to run Bitdefender without issue while performing high-resource activities like playing video games or editing videos. Next, I analyzed Bitdefender’s third-party lab test results to determine how well it protects your devices from malware. This policy states that Bitdefender will generally only share your information with data processors for the purposes of providing improved customer support and personalized email marketing. Bitdefender has additional security protocols for parental control data, ensuring that only you can access information about your children’s device usage. All of these protocols have proven effective, as Bitdefender hasn’t experienced a known security breach in well over five years. I tested most of these communication methods (excluding the community expert forum) to see how fast and helpful Bitdefender’s support team is. Bitdefender’s knowledge base is laid out well, with a search bar at the top and buttons to access various types of tutorials."

The company says the chatbot keeps no logs of your conversations, has end-to-end encryption for storing chats, and offers a ghost mode for conversations that disappear as soon as you close the window. Available via a web client, as well as Android and iOS apps, Lumo doesn’t require you to have an account to use the chatbot and ask questions. You can upload files to have the chatbot answer questions about them, and if you have a Proton Drive account, you can connect it with Lumo to access files stored in the cloud. The company says Lumo is based on open-source models, and it will only depend on them for research and development going forward without utilizing user data to train its models. Throughout its blog post about Lumo, Proton emphasized its European base, saying it gives the company a leg up over AI companies based in the U.S. and China when it comes to privacy. “Lumo is based upon open-source language models and operates from Proton’s European datacenters. This gives you much greater transparency into the way Lumo works than any other major AI assistant. Unlike Apple Intelligence and others, Lumo is not a partnership with OpenAI or other American or Chinese AI companies, and your queries are never sent to any third parties,” Proton said. This is not Proton’s first foray into the fast-developing AI tools space: Last year, it rolled out an AI-powered writing assistant for its Mail product that also runs on the user’s device."

    "summary": "The revamp of AppleCare will also cover older devices that are in good condition, but it may include higher prices for single-device coverage.",
    "full_text": "AppleCare One, which won't link with the similarly named Apple One subscription service plan, will cover up to three Apple devices for $20 a month. This includes any device Apple currently sells that's AppleCare eligible, and they can either be added during the first 60 days after a purchase or anytime up to four years after their purchase if they remain in \"good condition.\" Broadly, this means they must turn on and don't have a cracked screen. Additional devices can be added to AppleCare One for $6 each. But in instances where a customer wouldn't benefit from AppleCare One, such as covering just an Apple Watch and AirPods, Apple will instead direct the customer toward those original Plus plans. This may mean that new AppleCare Plus subscribers will have to pay slightly more, even if they weren't looking for theft and loss protection. Anyone who currently has an AppleCare plan that doesn't include theft and loss coverage can continue those terms until they conclude their subscription. Therefore, a theoretical iPhone 17 would quickly get added to an AppleCare One plan after being purchased, and automatically replace an iPhone 13 that's traded in. AppleCare One will likely be best for a single user who needs coverage for multiple Apple products, but the bundle service won't work across an entire family of Apple accounts. That might prove to be a slight point of confusion -- for instance, my Apple TV Plus account automatically shares with my parents and brother -- and families looking to cover multiple iPhones will either need to pay for each AppleCare Plus plan separately or consider phone insurance alternatives for comparable coverage."

They take up space, can be a hassle to clean and often struggle with irregularly sized cans. Richard Ingraham avoids certain kitchen tools when cooking for celebs like Dwayne Wade and Gabrielle Union. What to try instead: Cracking an egg and using the shell halves or your fingers works just as well. What to try instead: Smashing garlic cloves with a chef knife is quicker and more reliable. These scissors are gimmicky, awkward to clean and take up more space than they're worth.\" The electric version just adds clutter unless you boil eggs constantly and hate using a stove.\""

    "full_text": "Perhaps the biggest looming question is whether iPhones could get pricier, especially with tariffs. President Donald Trump has said Apple will have to pay a 25% tariff on iPhones made outside the US. A Bloomberg report from March supports those rumors and notes that the iPhone Air could measure 5.5mm thick. According to Kuo and Bloomberg, it's possible this version of the iPhone 17 would have only one main camera, doing without the ultrawide and 5x telephoto lenses that have been staples of Apple's premium iPhones for years. This can help conserve battery by automatically adjusting your iPhone's performance based on how you're using it at the moment, according to Apple. Adaptive Power could therefore be especially helpful with making the iPhone 17 Air's battery last longer. If the iPhone 17 Air takes off, that thinner form factor could shape Apple's other future devices. In January, a leaked image from Majin Bu on X suggested the phone could feature a pill-shaped camera bar, essentially resembling what you'd find on Google's Pixel 9 phone. Rumors on what frames the iPhone 17 lineup will feature have gone back and forth. Kuo noted the iPhone 17 Air and Pro models would sport that increased 12GB of RAM, but that Apple was still deciding whether to equip the baseline model with 8GB or 12GB of RAM."

    "full_text": "What if you could download Netflix’s entire library in under a second? How about every English language page on Wikipedia (including all revisions) five times over? That’s the dream scientists at Japan’s National Institute of Information and Communications Technology have made a reality, achieving a world record in data transmission speed of 1.02 Petabits per second over 1,123 miles -- roughly the distance between Miami and Cleveland. It might seem like a novelty record akin to hooking up 444 gaming consoles to one TV, but the breakthrough speeds have legitimate real-world implications. That’s because the researchers used fiber-optic cables compatible with existing infrastructure. For the test, they used a 19-core optical fiber with a standard cladding diameter of 0.125mm -- the same thickness currently used in networks worldwide. This 19-core optical fiber can use 19 different light paths to transmit data in the same space usually taken up by one. That’s how you can get such a massive increase in capacity without entirely overhauling the 870,000 miles of undersea cables that run the internet. A well-known rule in the networking world called Nielsen’s law states that a high-end internet user’s connection speed grows by roughly 50% each year, doubling every 21 months -- an observation that has held true since 1983. I’d say a high-end internet user has one-gig speeds right now; in a decade, it’s not hard to imagine that being 10Gbps."

    "summary": "Meta is adding some of its teen safety features to Instagram accounts featuring children, even if they're ran by adults. While children under 13 years of age aren't allowed to sign up on the social media app, Meta allows adults like parents and managers to run accounts for children and post videos and photos of them. The company says that these accounts are \"overwhelmingly used in benign ways,\" but they're also targeted by predators who leave sexual comments and ask for sexual images in DMs. \nIn the coming months, the company is giving these adult-ran kid accounts its strictest message settings to prevent unsavory DMs. It will also automatically turn on Hidden Words for them so that account owners can filter out unwanted comments on their posts. In addition, Meta will avoid recommending them to accounts blocked by teen users to lessen the chances predators finding them. The company will also make it harder for suspicious users to find them through search and will hide comments from potentially suspicious adults on their posts. Meta says will continue \"to take aggressive action\" on accounts breaking its rules: It has already removed 135,000 Instagram accounts for leaving sexual comments on and requesting sexual images from adult-managed accounts featuring children earlier this year. It also deleted an additional, 500,000 Facebook and Instagram accounts linked to those original ones.\nMeta introduced teen accounts on Instagram last year to automatically opt users 13 to 18 years of age into stricter privacy features. The company then launched teen accounts on Facebook and Messenger in April and is even testing AI age-detection tech to determine whether a supposed adult user has lied about their birthday so they could be moved to a teen account if needed. \nSince then, Meta has rolled out more and more safety features meant for younger teens. It released Location Notice in June to let younger teens know that they're chatting with someone from another country, since sextortion scammers typically lie about their location. (To note, authorities have observed a huge increase in \"sextortion\" cases involving kids being threatened online to send explicit images.) Meta also introduced a nudity protection feature, which blurs images in DM detected as containing nudity, since sextortion scammers may send nude pictures first in an effort to convince a victim to send reciprocate. \nToday, Meta is also launching new ways for teens to view safety tips. When they chat with someone in DMs, they can now tap on the \"Safety Tips\" icon at the top of the conversation to bring up a screen where they can restrict, block or report the other user. Meta has also launched a combined block and report option in DMs, so that users can take both actions together in one tap. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/meta-is-adding-new-safety-features-to-kid-focused-ig-accounts-run-by-adults-110000524.html?src=rss",

My Nest energy report wasn't very happy about January, but at least I had data telling me to make some changes. In addition to app control, two features make smart thermostats game-changing: presence sensing with learning algorithms and satellite sensors. Presence sensing uses basic motion sensors to detect when someone is moving near the thermostat or if there's general household activity. Those sensors also help shut the thermostat screen off when not in use, which saves money and helps most of these devices earn Energy Star ratings. I've found lots of ways to use both learning features and satellite sensors in my own home: Using a presence sensor keeps me from wasting money on a space heater in the mornings while learning functions quickly pick up that no one (except my cat) likes to get up early on the weekends. While high-tech thermostats are energy-saving standouts, they work even better when combined with the latest home heating and cooling tech. \"Those can often be in the evenings when more people are home and especially during heat waves or cold snaps.\" \"Older homes may not have a C-wire, in which case you'll need an electrician or HVAC professional to install one.\" The more notable threat is what data companies can gather about us in private moments of our daily lives, like morning habits or temperature choices."

There's a tiny Cherry magnet on that side too which I found to be an odd inclusion but at least you can take it off. Cherry switches have long been synonymous with build quality, and thankfully its keyboards are just as well built. The company claims the keyboard is scanning keypresses every half millisecond for an incredibly fast response rate, and while I wasn't able to directly test that claim, I can say it responded incredibly fast for me. I've tested several of their keyboards, and it's always hit or miss as to which are supported by the Cherry Utility software. There's a lot to love about the K5V2, especially if you prefer compact keyboards like I do. It's very well built, great for gaming and more customizable than most other keyboards I've tested. Of course, adding customization options other than the standard white or black will start to add up."

In The NYT’s examination of 5,000 parent-run accounts, it found 32 million connections to male followers. The notice will also prompt them to review their account privacy settings. Alongside today’s announcement, Meta is also bringing new safety features to DMs in Teen Accounts, its app experience with built-in protections for teens that are automatically applied.

The report defines an abortion desert as a county where an abortion clinic is more than 100 miles away -- but Javaid admits that doesn’t fully capture the challenge. \"100 miles is still a long way to go,\" Javaid said. The report states that one in 10 US counties are broadband deserts, where more than half of residents do not have access to at least 100Mbps down/20Mbps up (a definition set by the Federal Communications Commission). \"We know that it is likely an undercount because of the way they collect data. Although broadband is available to 94% of US households, according to current FCC numbers, that data doesn't account for the number of homes enrolled in an internet service. A 2024 Pew Research Center survey found that only 57% of adults making less than $30,000 a year have an internet subscription, compared to 95% of adults making at least $100,000. (Disclaimer: Ookla is owned by Ziff Davis, the same company that owns CNET.) With the passing of Dobbs v. Jackson, access to safe reproductive care is more threatened than ever: Infant mortality rates increased after the passing of Dobbs, specifically in states that instituted complete or 6-week abortion bans. Some possible solutions to making broadband more affordable and ensuring access to telehealth include state low-income requirements, like New York's $15 low-income plan required for ISPs serving 20,000 households or more."

If you deal with long periods of stress -- caused by factors like a high-pressure job, financial struggles or family responsibilities -- Shmouni says that cortisol can stay elevated in the body instead of fluctuating normally throughout the day. If you had trouble sleeping last night and are dealing with high stress at work, it may not be the best time for an intense workout. In addition to a high-sugar diet, alcohol and caffeine can also affect cortisol levels.

    "summary": "Whether you're backing up important files, editing videos on the go or just freeing up space on your laptop, a fast and reliable SSD drive can make your workflow a whole lot smoother. The best portable SSD options in 2025 combine speed, durability and wide compatibility, often using USB Type-C connections for quick transfers across devices. Unlike a traditional thumb drive or even the best external hard drives, these compact powerhouses can offer faster read speeds, often hitting several hundred or even thousands of Mbps, especially with high-performance NVMe SSD models.Whether you're managing large files or launching apps directly from your drive, we've rounded up the best SSDs that deliver excellent performance without weighing you down.\nTable of contents\n\nBest external SSDs for 2025\nOther external SSDs we tested\nWhat to consider before buying an external SSD\nHow we test external SSDs\nRecent updates\n\nBest external SSDs for 2025\n \n \n \nOther external SSDs we tested\nThe pre-built OWC Express 1M2 is a premium-feeling USB4 SSD that’s roughly as fast as the ADATA SE920, but it’s larger and significantly more expensive as of this writing. \nIf you’re in the relatively small group with a PC that supports USB 3.2 Gen 2x2 but not Thunderbolt or USB4, the Crucial X10 Pro is essentially a faster version of our top pick. The Lexar SL600 is a larger but slightly quicker option, while the Lexar SL500, Kingston XS2000 or Samsung T9 could also work if you see them on discount. As a reminder, though, drives like these are aimed primarily at content creators and other professionals, and you have to make sure you won’t upgrade to a device with a faster USB interface anytime soon.\nThe Samsung T7 Shield has a conveniently rugged design with a rubberized, IP65-rated shell. It also comes with both USB-C and USB-A cables. But it was consistently slower than the X9 Pro and XS1000 in our benchmark tests, plus it has a shorter three-year warranty.\nThe Silicon Power PX10 is an especially affordable USB 3.2 Gen 2 model. Its peak speeds weren’t too far off the X9 Pro or XS1000 in synthetic benchmarks, but it can get distractingly hot and its sustained writes are markedly worse. It took 50 seconds longer to move our 70GB custom test folder to this drive compared to the X9 Pro, for example.\nThe Crucial X6 is another low-cost option that’s a good bit slower than our top picks. It’s limited to a three-year warranty and lacks an IP rating as well. It’s not a terrible option for the basics, but there’s little reason to get it over the XS1000 when their prices are similar.\nThe OWC Envoy Pro FX is well-built and supports Thunderbolt 3 and USB 3.2 Gen 2, but it’s a smidge slower than the SE920 and Express 1M2, and it’s much pricier than the former.\n\n\n\n   The Samsung T9 portable SSD. \n \n\n   Samsung \n \n\nWhat to consider before buying an external SSD\nCapacity\nThe first thing to figure out before buying a portable SSD is just how much storage space you need. Most of the SSD drives we considered for this guide are available in capacities ranging from one to four terabytes, though plenty of smaller and larger options exist.\nThere’s no hard-and-fast rule for which size is “best” — that’ll ultimately depend on your budget and what exactly you’re looking to stash. But in general, it’s better to overcompensate than underdo it. Nobody wants to be forced into buying a second drive because they filled the first one up too quickly. If you’re backing up a PC, a good rule of thumb is to buy an external SSD with twice as much space as your computer’s internal storage. This way, you can save at least one full backup while also having room for additional data. If you want to store a bunch of PlayStation or Xbox games with huge install sizes, you may need more space. If you just want to back up a small collection of files, you may be better off saving your cash and just getting a smaller USB flash drive or thumb drive instead, which aren’t quite the same as the best portable SSDs we tested for this guide.\nPrice\nIn general, you get a better price-per-gigabyte ratio the further you go up the capacity ladder. As of this writing, the 1TB Samsung T9 is priced at $130, or $0.13 per gigabyte (GB), while the 4TB version is available for $297 or $0.07 per GB. That technically makes the larger model a better “value,” but not everyone needs to pay that much more upfront.\nSSDs in the same speed class tend to not vary too wildly in terms of performance, so part of our decision-making for this guide came down to which ones are often the cheapest. But prices can fluctuate over time; if you see that one of our top picks is priced way higher than a comparable honorable mention, feel free to get the latter. At this point in time, costs are broadly trending upwards for even the best SSDs.\n\n\n\n   The ADATA SE920 portable SSD connected to an Apple MacBook Pro. \n \n\n   Photo by Jeff Dunn / Engadget \n \n\nSpeed and USB interface\nJust about all external SSDs are significantly faster than mechanical hard disk drives (HDDs), so you’ll save time waiting for files to transfer and games to load no matter what. Within the market, however, there are distinct performance tiers. These are defined in large part by the USB interface a drive supports. While all of the SSDs we considered for this guide can connect over USB Type-C, some USB-C connections can supply faster transfer speeds than others. Sorting through this can get real confusing real fast, so we’ll try to put it in simple terms.\nYou can essentially divide today’s crop of portable SSDs into different segments. At the very top are drives that utilize the (relatively) new Thunderbolt 5 standard, which has a theoretical maximum transfer rate of 80 gigabits per second (Gbps). (You may see it advertise speeds up to 120 Gbps, but that boost doesn’t apply to storage devices.) But portable SSDs that support this tech only just started to trickle out toward the end of 2024, and the market for devices with Thunderbolt 5 ports is still fairly limited, with the most notable exceptions being Apple’s top-end Macs with an M4 Pro or M4 Max chip.\nThunderbolt 5 is built on a spec called USB4, which can technically reach up to 80 Gbps as well but is more typically available in a flavor that tops out at 40 Gbps. Portable SSDs based on that standard started to roll out toward the end of 2023 but are still relatively infrequent. The older Thunderbolt 3 and Thunderbolt 4, which other high-end external SSDs continue to use, support the same 40 Gbps maximum.\nA third version of USB4, meanwhile, maxes at 20 Gbps, as does an older yet more frequently used standard called USB 3.2 Gen 2x2. Below that is USB 3.2 Gen 2, which maxes at 10 Gbps. Then there’s USB 3.2 Gen 1, which is capped at 5 Gbps. Lastly, we’ll bundle together SSDs that use older standards and aren’t worth considering here.\nTo make this easy: For everyday folks, a good USB 3.2 Gen 2 drive is the sweet spot between fast-enough performance, wide-enough compatibility and cheap-enough price, so those make up our primary recommendations above. If you work in a creative field or don’t mind paying extra to shave seconds off your large file transfers, though, a “higher-tier” model would make sense. However, note that actual computers that utilize USB 3.2 Gen 2x2 aren’t super common — no Mac supports it, for one — and the interface is effectively being replaced by USB4.\nIn general, your chain is only as strong as its weakest link: If your computer only has USB 3.2 Gen 2 ports, for example, you could still use a Thunderbolt SSD, but you won’t get beyond Gen 2 speeds. Make sure you know what you’re working with before you buy.\nAs a refresher, storage devices are broadly measured in terms of read speeds and write speeds. The former refers to how long it takes to access something from the drive; the latter, how long it takes to save something to it. From there, you can break these metrics into sequential and random performance. Sequential speeds tend to matter more with portable SSDs, since most people use them to save or access long, constant streams of data such as a bunch of high-res photos. Random speeds would be important if you want to run video games or apps off the drive, since that’d involve reading and writing smaller, more scattered files. Either way, how well an SSD can sustain its performance with extended use is also critical.\nOther performance factors and enclosures\nA modern portable SSD’s speeds aren’t just about its USB interface, though. Its performance can also depend on how advanced its controller is, whether it has a native USB flash controller or a separate bridge chip to communicate with a host device, the kind and quality of NAND flash memory it uses, whether it has a DRAM cache or it’s DRAM-less, and more.\nWe’re simplifying things, but here are some quick tips: Drives with triple-level cell (TLC) memory aren’t as cheap as quad-level cell (QLC) SSDs, but they’re generally more reliable and they offer better write performance. Having a dedicated DRAM cache helps if you plan to hit your drive with more intense, sustained workloads, but may not be worth the extra cost for most people. Some models with native flash controllers may not perform as well as those with a bridging chip, depending on the SSD inside, but they typically draw less heat and are physically smaller. All of this is to say that an external SSD’s speeds aren’t quite as straightforward as what the manufacturer chooses to advertise on the box.\nIt’s also worth remembering that you can turn an internal SSD into a portable solution with a good enclosure. If you have a spare drive and don’t mind going the DIY route, this can be a cheaper and more flexible solution, though we’ve stuck to pre-built models for this guide for the sake of simplicity.\n\n\n\n\n   Photo by Jeff Dunn / Engadget \n \n\nSize, durability, endurance and warranty\nMost portable SSDs are impressively small and light, so they won’t be difficult to tuck in a bag (or even a pocket) and take on the go. We note above if any drive is bulkier than usual.\nNothing we’re talking about matters if your drive can’t last in the long term. It’s hard to definitively say which external SSDs are the most reliable, but we scoured through user reviews and feedback while researching this guide to ensure none of our picks show a pattern of catastrophic errors. If there was too much smoke around a particular model, we steered clear. We ruled out certain drives from SanDisk and Western Digital, for instance, after reports from Ars Technica and The Verge noted an issue that led to data loss (and lawsuits) in 2023.\nThat said, one of the big reasons you’d buy an SSD in general is its superior durability. Because it has no moving mechanical parts inside, an SSD has far fewer avenues to failure than an external hard drive. You still don’t want to be careless with them, but an accidental drop shouldn’t be the end of the world.\nSome portable SSDs build on this inherent ruggedness with plastic or rubberized casings and more robust waterproofing. These aren’t necessary for everyone, but if you’re a frequent traveler or someone who often works outdoors, there are options for you.\nStill, all drives can fail. If you have any sort of data you’d be distraught to lose, you should back it up regularly, then make a second backup, ideally with a cloud service. Along those protective lines, we also took note of the warranty policy for each drive we tested. Just about all of them are backed for either three or five years; of course, longer is better.\nEncryption and software\nIt’s not uncommon to store sensitive data on a portable SSD, so some models offer extra security features like hardware-based encryption — i.e., direct scrambling of data stored on the drive itself — built-in keypads and fingerprint readers to protect against unauthorized access if the drive is lost or stolen. While not top requirements, perks like these are certainly good to have. Some SSDs also come with companion software to further manage the drive. The best of those can be handy to have around, but we wouldn’t call them essential.\nHow we test external SSDs\nUnfortunately, we did not have access to a device that can make full use of USB 3.2 Gen 2, USB 3.2 Gen 2x2 and Thunderbolt/USB4 speeds interchangeably, so we had to split our testing across multiple devices, including an M1 Pro MacBook Pro and an Alienware gaming PC running Windows 11. Because of this, we primarily compared the portable SSDs within each “class” against one another. Before switching OSes, we reformatted each drive to each platform’s standard file system format: APFS for macOS and NTFS for Windows.\nAfter researching which SSDs had enough positive feedback to be worth testing in the first place, we put 13 drives through a range of synthetic and “real-world” benchmark tests. On Windows, these included CrystalDiskMark, PCMark 10’s Data Drive Benchmark and 3DMark’s gaming-focused Storage Benchmark. On macOS, we used AmorphousDiskMark (effectively a Mac version of CrystalDiskMark), BlackMagic Disk Speed Test and ATTO Disk Benchmark.\nWe also timed how long it took for each drive to read and write a custom 70GB folder filled with roughly 11,500 different files, including photos, videos, music files, PDFs and other large and small data types scattered across numerous subfolders. We performed multiple passes for each test to avoid irregularities, and we kept track of each SSD’s heat levels over the course of the whole suite. Our process wasn't a perfect science, but it gave us a general sense of how each drive compares to other models in its price and performance range.\nRecent updates\nFebruary 2025: We’ve checked to ensure the pricing info and links in this guide are still accurate. We’ve also added details on the (relatively) new Thunderbolt 5 interface, which has been implemented in a couple recent portable SSDs like the OWC Envoy Ultra and LaCie Rugged SSD Pro5. We’ll look to include testing notes for those for our next update, as they should be faster than the ADATA SE920, our current premium pick, albeit for a much higher price. For now, though, our top picks remain the same.\nOctober 2024: We’ve taken a sweep through this guide to ensure all pricing and availability info is still correct. Our recommendations are unchanged.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-portable-ssd-120043652.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Welcome to Video Games Weekly on Engadget. Expect a new story every Monday or Tuesday, broken into two parts. The first is a space for short essays and ramblings about video game trends and related topics from me, Jess Conditt, a reporter who's covered the industry for more than 13 years. The second contains the video game stories from the past week that you need to know about, including some headlines from outside of Engadget.\nPlease enjoy — and I'll see you next week.\n\nThis week, I’m fried. Maybe it’s the plodding and ever-present crumbling of society and human decency, or maybe it’s because Love Island USA just ended so I’m feeling extra listless. It’s a familiar summer sensation, but this year everything is exaggerated and extra tense, the stakes of every action seem higher, and instead of melting into the warmth of the season with a popsicle and a smile, I often find myself frozen and numb. I am the popsicle, coo coo ca choo.\nI’m not sure exactly what I’m trying to convey here, but I think it’s clear that I shouldn’t be writing anything too serious at the moment. I’m working on a few reports and trying to keep my composure amid the chaos, and all the while, the video game headlines keep rolling on. I’ve included a few more than usual this week, as penance for my popsicle state.\n\nThe news\nThe Chinese Room escapes from Tencent\nUK studio The Chinese Room, creator of Still Wakes the Deep and Everybody’s Gone to the Rapture, is independent once again. The Chinese Room leaders completed a management buyout with help from VC firm Hiro Capital to fully split the studio from Tencent subsidiary Sumo Digital, which acquired it in 2018. A number of people were laid off as part of the transition and the studio is left with a total of 55 employees. The Chinese Room is still working on Vampire: The Masquerade — Bloodlines 2 for Paradox Interactive, and it also has original projects in development.\nStill Wakes the Deep was one of my absolute favorite games of 2024. Whether you’re a fan of beautiful paranormal horror or you're just really into oil rigs, give it a go.\nRead these stories that Vice censored\nVice’s owner, Savage Ventures, doesn’t want you to read this story. Or this one.\nVice removed two articles about Steam’s new ban on certain “adult-only” content and the organization that pushed for the change, Collective Shout, which has the support of prominent anti-pornography groups with conservative religious foundations. The stories were written by contributor Ana Valens, who said the removals were “due to concerns about the controversial subject matter — not journalistic complaints.” Valens has vowed to never write for Vice again and a handful of reporters there have resigned in solidarity.\nCensoring stories about censorship is certainly a choice, Vice.\nSupermassive delays Directive 8020 and shrinks its team\nThe home of Until Dawn and The Dark Pictures Anthology, Supermassive Games, is laying off 36 people, restructuring its team and delaying one of its projects into 2026. A statement from the studio says the decisions were in response to the video game industry’s “challenging and ever-evolving environment.” It’s estimated that Supermassive had more than 300 employees before the layoffs.\nDirective 8020, the fifth installment in the Dark Pictures Anthology, is now due to come out in the first half of 2026, rather than this fall. Honestly, I’m not surprised to hear Supermassive needs more time to work on Directive 8020. I watched Engadget UK bureau chief Mat Smith play the demo at Summer Game Fest in June, and while it looked great, we were both surprised by how short and non-interactive the segment was. He summed up this feeling in his preview with the line, “Finally, I got to play (but only for a few minutes).”\nSupermassive is also working on Little Nightmares III, a series that it took over from Tarsier Studios. Tarsier created Little Nightmares and its sequel, but lost the rights to the IP when the team was acquired by a subsidiary of Embracer Group in 2019. Series publisher Bandai Namco kept the Little Nightmares brand and commissioned Supermassive to build the third game, while Tarsier is working on its own project, Reanimal.\nIt makes sense that Supermassive would prioritize Little Nightmares III in order to fulfill its obligations with Bandai. The game has already been delayed once, and it’s set to hit PC and consoles on October 10.\nFBC: Firebreak is getting less busted\nI still have high hopes for FBC: Firebreak to be the Left 4 Dead revival we’ve always wanted, but fact is, it’s not quite there yet. Remedy Entertainment is aware of this hard truth and has a plan to fix it. The studio laid out its pipeline for making FBC: Firebreak easier to jump into, more fun to play and less confusing overall, with most major changes coming in an update this winter.\nValve is still the best retirement community in game development\nPCGamesN published an interview with Counter-Strike co-creator Minh Le, who left Valve years ago to try out independent development. One sentiment stuck out to me.\n“They didn't force me out or anything,” Le told PCGamesN. “But a part of me kind of regrets it. Looking back, my decision to leave Valve was, financially, kind of a poor decision. If I had stayed with Valve, I would have been able to retire by now.”\nIt’s not presented as an indictment of Valve, but I find it notable that Le describes the studio as a place to retire, rather than a space to innovate and create the next generation of video games. At this rate, Valve will never outrun its reputation as the studio where talented game developers go to die (professionally speaking). \nBut, hey, at least they're not getting laid off en masse. Which, unfortunately, brings us to the next headline.\nYour favorite studio’s favorite studio faces layoffs\nCyberpunk 2077, Sea of Thieves and Dune: Awakening support studio Virtuos is laying off 270 developers, which is about seven percent of its staff. Virtuos is currently best known as the studio behind The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remastered alongside Bethesda, and it has more than 4,000 employees across Asia, Europe and North America. The cuts affect developers in Asia and Europe, with “fewer than 10” in France, where work on Oblivion Remastered was headquartered.\nHeck yeah, there’s gonna be a Hellraiser game\nMake sure to pin this one on your calendar. Saber Interactive is making Clive Barker's Hellraiser: Revival, a first-person, action-survival horror game that features actor Doug Bradley as Pinhead for the first time in nearly 20 years. Barker himself provided input on the story, too. It’s coming to PlayStation 5, PC and Xbox Series X/S, with no release date yet.\n\"The Hellraiser universe is defined by its unflinching exploration of pain, pleasure, and the thin and terrifying line that separates the two,\" a description from Saber Interactive reads. \"That essence is at the heart of our game.\"\n\nAn inside look at the fallout of the Zenimax layoffs\nGame Developer reporter Chris Kerr spoke with a number of employees at Zenimax who are still reeling from the layoffs that Microsoft enacted in early July. The vibes there sound pretty terrible.\n“This carcass of workers that remains is somehow supposed to keep shipping award-winning games,\" one senior QA tester told Kerr. The developer continued, “Microsoft just took everything that could have been great about the culture and collaboration and decimated it. Morale is terrible. It's grotesque. People are stressed. They're crying.”\nXbox cloud play anywhere\nWhen Xbox isn’t firing thousands of employees in one blow, it’s quietly laying the groundwork for the future of video game distribution. An update for Xbox Insiders this week introduces cross-platform cloud support, bringing your cloud library and play history to the Xbox PC app. This means you can access cloud activity on an Xbox console, PC or Windows handheld, and seamlessly play cloud games across devices. This is just how video games are going to work in the coming decades, and it’s interesting to watch our future slowly roll out in blog posts and software updates.\nSubnautica 2 scandal catch-up\nDid you miss all of the mess around Subnautica 2 last week? Or, more accurately, this past month? To quickly summarize, Subnautica publisher Krafton is being sued by the series creators after it fired them and then delayed their game, allegedly sabotaging a $250 million bonus payout due to developers. To not-quickly summarize, see my complete breakdown of the drama.\nMy Melody & Kuromi hits Netflix this week\nI don’t know who else needs a little levity in their life right now, but I certainly do. Thankfully, the stop-motion show My Melody & Kuromi is coming to Netflix on July 24, and there’s already an adorable tie-in music video by LE SSERAFIM to enjoy. Zen out, watch all of the Sanrio sweetness and finally settle the debate: Are you more of a Kuromi or a My Melody?\n\nAdditional reading\n\nKris Holt's weekly indie game roundup\n\n\nHave a tip for Jessica? You can reach her by email, Bluesky or send a message to @jesscon.96 to chat confidentially on Signal.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/video-games-weekly-censorship-shrinkage-and-a-subnautica-scandal-221839722.html?src=rss",

The AI angle of Bee may be of particular interest for Amazon, especially as the company pushes its Alexa+ generative AI assistant.

If cybercriminals know a ransomware attack against a UK school or hospital won't get them paid, they'll look somewhere else for a more lucrative target. Security Minister Dan Jarvis said that the government is \"determined to smash the cyber criminal business model,\" and added that laws in the proposed package will require even private businesses to seek guidance from the government before paying a ransom.\nSince the WannaCry attack on the NHS in 2017 launched the modern era of ransomware attacks, the UK has suffered a number of serious incidents.

The notifications have helped security researchers who focus on spyware to document abuses in several countries such as India, El Salvador, and Thailand. On Apple’s support page for what the company calls “threat notifications,” last updated in April, the tech giant said that since 2021 it has notified users in “in over 150 countries,” which shows how widespread the use of government spyware is. To help victims, since last year, Apple has recommended those who received these threat notifications to reach out to digital rights group AccessNow, which runs an around-the-clock helpline staffed with researchers who can investigate spyware attacks.

This acquisition signals Amazon’s interest in developing wearable AI devices, a different avenue from its voice-controlled home assistant products like its line of Echo speakers. Apple is rumored to be working on AI-powered smart glasses as well. These products come with a number of security and privacy risks, given that they record everything around them; different companies’ policies will vary in terms of how voice recordings are processed, stored, and used for AI training. Bee previously indicated that it planned to only record the voices of people who have verbally consented. Bee also says it’s working on a feature to allow users to define boundaries — both based on topic and location — that will automatically pause the device’s learning. The company noted that it plans to build on-device AI processing, which generally poses less of a privacy risk than processing data in the cloud. It’s not clear if these policies will change as Bee is integrated into Amazon, however — and Amazon has a mixed record on the handling of user data from its customers’ devices. Ring also settled claims in 2023 brought by the Federal Trade Commission that employees and contractors had broad and unrestricted access to customers’ videos."

    "summary": "Meta is no longer paying creators to post on Threads. The company quietly ended the Threads bonus program, which offered some creators thousands of dollars a month in bonuses, earlier this year, Engadget has confirmed.\nThe company hasn't officially commented on why it stopped the payments, but an Instagram support page that once listed details about the creator incentives no longer references Threads at all. In posts on Threads, creators who were once part of the program have said they stopped receiving payments around the end of April. That's roughly one year after Meta first started paying creators for popular posts. Though Meta never publicly shared a lot of details about how the program worked, creators who previously spoke with Engadget reported that they were able to earn monthly bonuses ranging from $500 to $5,000 in exchange for hitting specific metrics around post counts and views.\nIt's not clear what Meta's strategy for creators on Threads is going forward. The company is still trying to lure more brands and notable faces to the platform, and has tested features to help people find popular creators they previously followed on X. Meta has also added creator-friendly tools, like the ability to add more links to profiles and more detailed analytics for the app.\nBut Meta has yet to clearly explain what it can offer creators in return.

In posts on Threads, creators who were once part of the program have said they stopped receiving payments around the end of April. That's roughly one year after Meta first started paying creators for popular posts. Though Meta never publicly shared a lot of details about how the program worked, creators who previously spoke with Engadget reported that they were able to earn monthly bonuses ranging from $500 to $5,000 in exchange for hitting specific metrics around post counts and views.

    "summary": "Gamers aren't usually known for their sartorial elegance. But that doesn't mean we don't deserve nice things. So after checking out a very utilitarian carrying case for the Switch 2, I wanted to explore the other side of things with a more lavish travel bag. And while Waterfield's Magnetic case for Nintendo's latest console certainly isn't the most rugged or affordable way to lug a handheld console around, it might just be the most luxurious.\nDesign: Drape me in this leather\nCompared to most Switch 2 travel bags that are made out of materials like plastic and polyester, Waterfield's case is an exercise in opulence. It's crafted from buttery full-grain leather that's softer than than a perfectly worn in baseball mitt or fancy Dior gloves. It really is that nice. \n \nI've been using the white leather model as I love how clean and simple it looks while still giving you that irresistible pillowy exterior. But for the kind of folk who get excited about patina, the chocolate model features a more distressed look that isn't afraid to show off oil, scuffs and blemishes. And if the need arises, you can always hit the case with hot air from a hair dryer to reduce the appearance of scratches.\nBut the thing that sets Waterfield's case apart from its competition is that instead of relying on a zipper, the pouch has a series of magnets to keep everything together. And honestly, there's just something really nice about not having any sharp objects near or around the case, so there's no fear of your Switch 2 getting nicked. This enclosure system also makes it super simple to thread a cable inside, allowing you to charge Nintendo's latest handheld without it needing to leave the safety of its case. On a practical level, I've also found that because taking the console in and out is so quick and easy, I'm much better about putting things back when I'm done gaming.\nThe obvious downside to this is that it's easier for stuff like sand to get inside and if you're storing tiny accessories like a microSD Express card, there's no real guarantee it won't fall out while you're in transit. Additionally, the trade-off for the case's fancy leather exterior is that it doesn't have the hard, rigid panels used in a lot of competitors, so it's not the most rugged travel companion. If you press down on the outside of the case, you can feel things like console's buttons and joysticks, so this definitely isn't something you'll want to cram into an already stuffed piece of luggage.\nOn the inside, Waterfield's case is lined with a plush microfiber fabric that will keep the Switch 2 nice and cozy. There are also two pockets for stashing small items like charging cables, game cartridges or Joy-Con straps. But I do mean small, because anything larger will cause the case to bulge, which may put undue stress on the console.\nOptional accessories\n\n\n\n\n   Sam Rutherford for Engadget \n \n\nThis case doesn't come with much in the way of bundled extras. Though like a lot of luxury products (just look at the options list on a Porsche or Ferrari), you can purchase additional accessories such as cord clips, AirTag holders and more. But the most important of these are Waterfield's game card holders, which are available in several sizes (4, 10 and 20). So I went and bought a 10-slot sleeve and it really is the perfect complement to the case. Cartridges fit snug and the holder itself nestles neatly into the pouch's built-in pockets. I just wish one came included, as you're looking at an extra $10 to $30 on top of an already pricey travel protector.\nWrap-up\nStarting at $90 for the nylon or waxed canvas models or $120 for the leather versions, Waterfield's Magnetic Case for the Switch 2 certainly ain't cheap. That's more expensive than Belkin's Charging Case, which comes with its own battery pack. And that's before you factor in a game card holder.\n\n\n\n\n   Sam Rutherford for Engadget \n \n\nBut the sheer suppleness of its leather and its super soft interior might be the comfiest cocoon Nintendo's handheld will ever experience. Then you add in a magnetic enclosure system and it feels like Waterfield has managed to transform a product that might normally be an afterthought into something that's a joy to use all by itself. So for those who want a travel pouch that looks and feels just as good as the console it's protecting (if not better), this case is in a class of its own.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/waterfield-magnetic-case-review-the-most-lavish-way-to-carry-your-switch-2-around-200052731.html?src=rss",

This goes live on July 31, allowing folks to juice up at more than 12,000 Supercharger stations throughout North America. Some of the company's vehicles can already use these charging stations, with the Gravity SUV gaining access earlier this year.\nThat leaves the Air line of luxury EV sedans. These vehicles will be able to roll up to a Tesla Supercharger for a top-off at the end of the month, but there are some major caveats. First of all, Lucid Air EVs will require an official adapter that costs $220, as they don't ship with a built-in NACS ports. This adapter won't work with V1 or V2 charging stations, which whittles down the convenience factor a bit.\nThere's another problem for Air owners. The adapter is limited to a 50kW peak charge rate, which provides around 200 miles of range per hour of charging. The Air can typically achieve a 300kW peak charge rate. Not only is this hobbled charge rate bad for Lucid Air devotees, it's also annoying for people that own other EVs. Remember, the Air will have to sit at the charger for an entire hour, which will increase traffic at the station.\nLuckily, there are other charging stations available that make use of that 300kW peak rate. Air owners can use stations by Electrify America, EVgo and ChargePoint for a quick jolt. It's good to know that the Tesla Superchargers will be there in a pinch, which could come in handy during a road trip.\n\n\nThe company also recently unveiled the 2026 lineup of Air EVs. There's the Lucid Air Pure, which is a relatively streamlined option. Prices for this one start at $70,900. The Lucid Air Touring boasts an estimated range of 431 miles per charge, which is a decent metric. It starts at $79,900. Finally, the Lucid Air Grand Touring is the baddest of the bunch, with an estimated range of 512 miles per charge.

Pokémon Tales: The Misadventures of Sirfetch’d and Pichu isn't coming until 2027 and there's no streaming platform attached just yet. The trailer dropped during today's Pokémon Presents livestream which also gave us footage of the second batch of Pokémon Concierge episodes and a full hour of Pikachu DJing for some reason."

    "summary": "Elgato’s latest capture card supports 4K at 60 fps to capture rich in‑game imagery in all its glory. The Game Capture 4K S works with just about any modern console, PC or handheld gaming device, including the Switch 2. Retailing for $160, this is the CORSAIR subsidiary’s best value yet for capturing in 4K. Elgato's higher-end 4K X supports 4K capture at 144 fps but costs quite a bit more.\nThough a more affordable model, the 4K S doesn't skimp where it matters. The new capture card features zero-latency passthrough to your main display, and Elgato says latency in software previews can be as low as 30 milliseconds. Short of the most competitive FPS games, this is fast enough to play on a single screen if you must. If you are trying to capture a game like Valorant or CS2 and care more about frame rate than raw resolution, the 4K S can record at 1440p120 or 1080p240.\nThe 4K S also supports HDR10 passthrough up to 4K60, HDR10 capture to 1080p60 on Windows, VRR support and it has an analog audio jack for native team chat. The device is plug-and-play over USB-C for Windows 11, macOS and iPadOS. For those whose creative workflow lives on iPad, the 4K S can capture directly to iPad models with a USB-C port. Thanks to UVC compliance, the device is compatible with OBS Studio, Streamlabs, Zoom, TikTok Live Studio and other major broadcast apps.\n\nElgato is also releasing its newest capture application, Elgato Studio, which will replace 4KCU in the coming months. The software auto-detects the 4K S and offers ultra-low latency on previews. It will also include features like a snapshot tool for social media clips and allow creators to try out beta features through the software.\nThe Game Capture 4K S is available now for $159.99.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/elgatos-new-game-capture-4k-s-is-switch-2-compatible-164745527.html?src=rss",

Billed by its maker as the ideal entry-level fitness watch, the $99 Watch 3 Pro is the most advanced CMF wearable to date, promising updated health tracking and various built-in AI coaching features.\nThe Watch 3 Pro introduces dual-band GPS, which should make its route tracking more accurate, as well as a new four-channel heart rate sensor that Nothing says offers \"improved accuracy across all skin tones and workout intensities.\" You can choose from 131 sports modes, which is 11 more than its predecessor, with a personalized AI coach providing post-workout summaries and guidance. This includes long-distance running endurance predictions to help you train for that looming 10K.\nIn addition to the updated heart rate and sleep tracking, the Watch 3 Pro is also capable of blood oxygen (SpO₂) monitoring, stress tracking, guided breathing exercises, hydration and inactivity reminders, as well as women’s health tracking.\nOn-wrist ChatGPT integration allows you to ask questions and set reminders using \"natural language\" voice prompts, and there’s a voice recorder with autotranscription for when you want to quickly log a mid-run thought. You can also use AI to generate custom watch faces using the Watch Face Studio, in which you’ll find more than 120 styles premade out of the box. Widgets can be applied for fitness, weather, music or reminders, with a full-screen option available.\nCMF’s latest wearable has a 1.43-inch AMOLED, always-on display, and you’re getting a 10 percent increase in screen-to-body ratio compared to the Watch Pro 2 before it. Battery life is 13 days with \"typical\" use, which Nothing says is a two-day improvement over its predecessor. If you're hitting the tracking hard you can expect around 11 days of juice on a full charge. With the always-on display enabled, battery life unsurprisingly takes a significant hit to around 4.5 days.\nNothing says the Watch 3 Pro and all other smartwatches in the CMF lineup now use the Nothing X app, with the new control centre promising improved stability and a more intuitive UI. It also plays nice with Strava, Apple Health, and Google Health Connect\nYou’re getting a fair bit of bang for your buck, then, but we’ll have to wait and see how the Watch 3 Pro fares against pricier alternatives where everyday performance is concerned. When TechRadar reviewed the Watch 2 Pro earlier this year, it had lots of positive impressions of the watch, but noted some spotty fitness tracking and sensor detection. 9to5Google was even more critical, finding fault with the heart rate tracking and concluding that the product felt unfinished. And while the Watch 3 Pro covers a lot of the bases for fitness watches with its various sensors, it still lacks NFC for payments, which could be a deal-breaker for some people.\nAvailable in Dark Grey, Light Grey, and Orange colorways, the CMF Watch 3 Pro costs $99 (a not insignificant $30 bump on the Watch Pro 2) is available to buy now.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wearables/nothings-99-cmf-watch-3-pro-offers-better-battery-life-and-ai-fitness-coaching-151058055.html?src=rss",

That means if a user folds their phone roughly 100 times a day, the display could last for over 10 years. In its announcement, Samsung said that \"durability is no longer a limiting factor in the lifespan of foldable smartphones.\"\nThe company took cues from bulletproof glass to create a shock-proof design for the new foldable OLED panel. It increased the thickness of the display's outermost glass by 50 percent and applied high-elastic adhesive to every layer of the panel so that it can better absorb external impact. The new display can also distribute shock more evenly across its surface, and Samsung used titanium plate as support for the whole structure to make it stronger than before. In addition, by using more advanced materials and redesigning the panel layer, the company was able to achieve a thinner profile so that the device looks and feels like any regular handset now. \nPrevious versions of the Galaxy Z Fold, from the first through the sixth, were only rated for 200,000 folds.

But to get the most out of it, you’ll need the right accessories to match. That’s where AirTag accessories come in, helping you attach, protect and style your tracker in a way that suits your daily routine.Whether you're looking for a low-profile AirTag wallet insert, a rugged AirTag mount for your bike or pet’s collar or an Apple AirTag holder with multiple color options that adds a personal touch, there’s no shortage of great options. Some accessories come in hard plastic or hard shell designs for extra durability, while others double as a sleek protective case or minimalist tag holder.

If you're comfortable slipping an AirTag into an interior pocket of a bag or coat, you can do so without an extra accessory. But if you want to use one to keep track of your keys, wallet, backpack or even your pet on their collar, you'll need an accessory that can accommodate that use case.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-apple-airtag-cases-holders-accessories-123036404.html?src=rss",
    "full_text": "AirTags can also help you keep track of larger bags and luggage, and you could easily slip one into an interior pocket and call it a day. But if you’d rather hook the tracker to the outside, you’ll need something a bit larger and more flexible than a standard key ring. Belkin’s Secure Holder with Strap is a good option: it comes in different colors and it’s budget friendly at only $13. The case opens up into two pieces, allowing you to sit the AirTag inside the circle and twist and snap the two halves together to lock it in. You can then attach the AirTag to your luggage handle, dog collar, water bottle or other item with the strap, which feels quite strong. I appreciate the unique design of Belkin’s Secure Holder, although it was hard to twist open when the AirTag was inside of it. But that’s a good thing for daily use; your AirTag isn’t going anywhere when in the Secure Holder. I also liked its slightly raised edges, which provide extra protection against impacts and bumps."

    "summary": "Whether it’s your nephew who wants a new iPad, your sister who needs a new pair of AirPods or your parent who could benefit from an easy-to-use MacBook, Apple devices are some of the most in-demand devices you can get today. That means, unfortunately, that big discounts are few and far between, and they’re often the first to sell out when sales do arise. But make no mistake: you can find good Apple deals across the web, you just have to know where to look.\nEngadget keeps track of deals like these regularly, so we’re here to help. We’ve collected the best Apple deals on items like AirPods, MacBooks, iPads and more that you can get right now. Just note: you’ll find the best Apple deals from retailers like Amazon, Best Buy, Walmart, Target and others — not directly from Apple. Unless you shop refurbished, you’ll always pay top dollar direct at Apple, and for some things (like iPhones), that might be the best route to take.  \nBest Apple Watch deals\n \nApple Watch SE for $169 (32 percent off): We wouldn’t be surprised to see an update to Apple’s budget smartwatch sometime soon (and we have a few suggestions on the matter). But thanks to some serious discounts, the Apple Watch SE has turned out to be the most affordable way to get an iPhone companion for your wrist. Despite the lackluster screen and limited extra features, it handles the basics well. Also at Best Buy and Walmart.\nBest AirPods deals\n \nBest iPad deals\n \niPad Pro (M4, 11-inch) for $899 ($100 off): The most powerful iPad is the iPad Pro, and it’s the one to get if you’re even toying with the idea of using your new slab as a laptop replacement. Both the 11- and 13-inch models have gorgeous displays, thinner and lighter designs, a repositioned front camera and the excessively powerful M4 chip inside. Also at Best Buy. \nBest MacBook deals\n \nApple MacBook Air (15-inch, M3, 24GB RAM) for $1,299 ($400 off): The last-gen M3 MacBook Air has officially been discontinued, but it remains a superb laptop while the last bits of stock remain available. We gave this 15-inch model a score of 90 in our review — outside of its slower chip (which is still plenty fast for everyday use), marginally improved camera and inability to power two external displays with the lid open, it's virtually identical to the newer version. This deal applies to the model with the larger 24GB of memory in the Starlight colorway. \nMacBook Air (M3, 15-inch) for $949 ($350 off): The base model M3 MacBook Air is also available at a sizeable discount..\nApple MacBook Air (15-inch, M4) for $1,049 ($150 off): The 15-inch MacBook Air is nearly identical to the smaller version but features more robust speakers and a more spacious trackpad alongside its roomier display. Also at B&H.\nBest Apple accessories deals\nApple Pencil (USB-C) for $69 ($10 off): This more affordable Apple Pencil doesn’t support pressure sensitivity, but it still makes for a useful stylus for the basics. If you’re a casual note-taker and can live without wireless charging, you’ll save a few bucks by picking this one up. Also available at Walmart.\nApple Pencil (2nd gen) for $90 ($39 off): The Second gen Pencil both attaches and charges magnetically, supports tilt and pressure sensitivity and allows for tool changes with a tap of the flat edge. It’s an older pencil and isn’t compatible with the latest iPad models. This is the lowest price we’ve tracked this year, but it went as low as $80 for last year’s Black Friday sales.\nRead more Apple coverage:\n\nThe best AirPods\nThe best Apple Watches\nThe best MacBooks\nThe best iPhones\nThe best iPads\n\nFollow @EngadgetDeals on X for the latest tech deals and buying advice.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/best-apple-deals-150020110.html?src=rss",

Now there's an actual trailer filled with gameplay footage and it looks pretty nifty.\nDeveloper Alexander \"Red888guns\" Berezin is the brains behind the project and he used the GZDoom engine to recreate the ghoul city of Necropolis from Fallout 1 as an FPS that resembles the newer games. The art style is pretty incredible in this trailer and looks to be a highlight of the project. Take a look for yourself.\n\nThis doesn't look like a full mod of the entire game, as that would be quite the undertaking. Rather, it reimagines the Necropolis section. The trailer ends with a confrontation with the boss of that zone, indicating the mod will be a retelling of the sequence, and not a reimagining of the whole game. This reminds me of the first installment of the Final Fantasy VII remake that was entirely set in Midgar.\nUnfortunately, we have some time to wait before we get our hands on this mod. The trailer indicates a release date in 2027. There's also the Bethesda-sized elephant in the room. Who knows if the company's lawyers will go on a letter-writing spree to get this project shut down. \nReally been pushing Alexander to make sure we've got a living, breathing, retro-futuristic (but sometimes seedy) world for NB RPG.

    "summary": "We are mere days away from the official launch of the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 on July 25. Amazon is enticing customers to try out the foldable handset by throwing in a $300 gift card with every pre-order. This can be used to purchase anything on the platform and is available with every color and both the 256GB and 512GB versions of the Z Fold 7.\nWe strongly recommend going for the 512GB model, as the two storage options are the same price ($2,000) during this pre-order period. Samsung is offering a similar promotion, but that $300 gift card can only be used on the company's official store. This could be a good fit for those looking for accessories, but Amazon offers more bang for your buck. \n \nDespite not actually being out yet, the Z Fold 7 is already making a splash in the foldable scene. We were so impressed with our review unit that we placed the gadget at the top of our list of the best foldable phones. It's a remarkably thin device, with a sleekly-designed hinge that stays out of the way when opened.\nThe 200MP main camera is fantastic, the specs are unparalleled and both displays are gorgeous. We called it a \"stunning device\" in our official review, going on to praise the 120Hz refresh rate of both screens and the peak brightness of 2,600 nits. We said that the displays \"pop a touch more\" compared to rivals like the Pixel 9 Pro Fold.\nThe main downside here is the price. We know foldables are the hot, new thing for the tech-obsessed, but $2,000 is a whole lot of cheddar for a handset. Today's deal (sort of) brings that down to $1,700, which makes things a bit more palatable.\nFollow @EngadgetDeals on X for the latest tech deals and buying advice.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/amazon-includes-a-free-300-gift-card-when-you-pre-order-the-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-151315661.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "If you’ve been shocked by how much you spend on streaming services lately, you’re not alone. Companies like Netflix, Disney, HBO Max and others have been consistently raising prices to the point where you may question if streaming is even worth it anymore. We at Engadget still think it is, but we also think you should be smart with your money — and that’s where streaming deals come in.\nYes, it is possible to get discounts on services like Peacock and Paramount+, even if those deals aren’t as common as a sale on AirPods. If you’re looking to save money and still stream all of the content you want, Engadget can help by laying out the best streaming deals you can get right now, how you can save with bundles and everything you should know before paying for yet another streaming service. \nBest streaming deals\nTrue streaming deals can be hard to come by. Most often, they’ll pop up during the Black Friday shopping period. On occasion, we’ll see them sparingly throughout the year and they usually take the form of a discounted monthly or annual rate for a limited period of time. Also, true streaming deals are typically on the ad-supported versions of a service, but once in a while you’ll find a unicorn of a deal on a tier that has ad-free viewing.\nIf you’re able to wait for a deal before subscribing to a streaming service, we recommend doing so. You’ll save money upfront and in the long run, and you also have the option to cancel your subscription before the price goes back up to the normal rate. Maybe you find you like the service so much that you’re fine paying full price for it — that’s the ideal situation. But if you’re not compelled to keep that app on rotation in your smart TV, most streaming services make it easy for you to cancel at any time. With that said, these are the best streaming deals you can snag right now.\n \nSpotify Premium Individual (1 month) for $0 ($12 off): This is our favorite music streaming service for podcasts and social features. Right now, users who have not signed up for Spotify's Premium service before are eligible to get one month for free. The Premium Individual plan lets you listen ad-free and skip songs at will. You can also organize your listening queue and download content for offline listening. Just be aware, your subscription will auto-renew at the end of the trial period. So if you don't want to be on the hook for the $12 monthly fee, set a reminder to cancel and go back to the free version.\nSling Orange for $23/month for the first month (50 percent off): New customers can get Sling Orange or Sling Blue for half off the usual price for the first month, bringing the final prices to $23/month and $25.50/month, respectively. Orange is likely best for sports fans, with eight exclusive sports and family channels, while Blue includes 19 exclusive news and entertainment channels. You can get both Orange and Blue access also for half off for one month, or $33 total.\nYouTube TV (two months) for $120 ($46 off): You can get two months of our favorite live TV streaming service for $60 per month which works out to $46 less than paying the full $83 each month. And right now, the service is free for the first 21 days. That should give you a decent chunk of time to see if the service is right for you. The discount and trial are only open to new subscribers to YouTube TV’s base plan, which includes access to over 100 channels, unlimited DVR space and six household accounts with the ability to stream on three devices at once. The deal ends July 31.\nFubo Pro for $65/month for the first month ($20 off): Fubo has introductory discounts on most of its packages, and the Pro package is the least expensive plan currently listed. It offers access to 224 channels, unlimited cloud DVR and up to 10 simultaneous streams. It even includes regional sports content from the NHL, MLB and NBA.\nSling TV + MLB.TV for $30 off: New subscribers can get $30 off their first month of Sling TV when they sign up and add MLB.TV to their package. The offer applies to Sling Orange, Sling Blue and Sling Orange & Blue, and MLB.TV gives you access to MLB Network along with access to all out-of-market games during the regular season. This offer runs through May 31.\nHBO Max student discount — subscribe for $5/month (50 percent off): HBO Max offers their ad-supported tier to students for half off the usual rate. You’ll just have to verify that you’re a student through Unidays, and make note that this offer is only good for up to 12 months of service.\nHulu student discount — subscribe for $2/month (75 percent off): Those with a valid student ID can get Hulu’s ad-supported tier for 75 percent off the typical rate. They’ll keep the same sale price for as long as they’re a student as well.\nSpotify student discount — Premium + Hulu with ads for $6/month (72 percent off): Spotify’s student offer continues to be one of the best around, giving you access to the Premium tier of the music streamer and Hulu’s ad-supported plan for only $6 monthly. Purchased separately, you’d pay $22 per month for both of the services. Plus, the first month is free when you sign up.\nNBA League Pass student discount — one year for $120 (40 percent off): Students can get one year of League Pass for only $10 per month, which includes access to NBA TV and the ability to watch classic and archive games on-demand. On the NBA League Pass website, look for the student discount banner at the top and follow the instructions to verify your student status.\nPeacock first responders discount — one year for $48 (50 percent off): Medical professionals and first responders can save 50 percent each year of Peacock. The deal requires annual verification and is open to those who work for either private or public institutions. Peacock has some great stuff to watch, including Poker Face and Killing It and more.\nStreaming bundle discounts\nThere’s more consolidation happening now than ever before in the streaming space, and that means there are more streaming bundle options. These bundles offer you access to more content with one subscription price, but those prices are typically higher than paying for a single service by itself (obviously). It may be tempting to just get the bundle, but if only one of those services in the bundle speaks to you, you’ll spend less overall by just paying for the single service.\nSpeaking of a deep love for a single streaming service: if all of your favorite shows are on Peacock or the latest releases on HBO Max consistently bring you joy, consider paying for one year upfront. Subscribing with an annual plan usually saves you money in the long term over paying on a monthly basis. Unfortunately, not all streaming services (looking at you, Netflix) have an annual subscription option. Here are some of the best streaming bundles you can get right now.\n \nDisney+, Hulu, HBO Max bundle with ads for $17/month: Ad-supported HBO Max is included here, along with full, ad-supported access to Disney+ and Hulu. You’ll save 43 percent with this bundle, as opposed to paying for all three services individually.\nDisney+ and Hulu Bundle Premium for $20/month: Disney and Hulu offer a few different bundles, which you can view in the drop-down lists under Choose Your Plan. This bundle removes the ads from both Disney+ and Hulu (with the exception of select live and linear content) and allows you to download content for offline viewing. You’ll save 42 percent with this bundle, as opposed to paying for both ad-free tiers individually.\nParamount+ with Showtime for $13/month or $120/year: This includes everything in Paramount+’s Essential plan, except the ads, and also provides access to Showtime content, live CBS streams and download features.\nSling TV + HBO Max starting at $53/month: Sling TV and HBO Max have partnered on a discount that gives new subscribers 50 percent off their first month of Sling TV, plus $5 off monthly when you subscribe to the Sling TV + HBO Max bundle. The standard price for the Sling Blue + HBO Max duo is roughly $58/month, so you'll get a monthly discount of $5 off that. In addition, for the first month only, you'll get half off the price of the bundle. The promotion also applies to the Sling Orange & Blue + HBO Max package, which has a standard price of $73/month.\nHulu + Live TV with Disney+ and ESPN+ for $96/month: This streaming bundle amalgamation is a bit confusing but it does offer a lot: you get live TV streaming via Hulu’s service plus access to the following VOD services: Hulu, Disney+ and ESPN+. Out of those three, only ESPN+ will have ads.\nDisney+, Hulu, ESPN+ Bundle Basic for $17/month: You get full access to Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+ content with this package, albeit with ads across the board. This bundle price is 46 percent off the total price of all three separate subscriptions.\nDisney+, Hulu, ESPN+ Bundle Premium for $27/month: Similarly to the Duo bundles, the Premium version of the Trio removes ads from most content in Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+, and you can download content for offline viewing. This price represents a 43-percent savings when compared to paying for all three ad-free tiers separately.\nRead more streaming coverage\n\nThe best live TV streaming services to cut cable\nThe best streaming services: Netflix, Hulu, HBO Max and more\nThe best streaming devices\n\nFollow @EngadgetDeals on X for the latest tech deals and buying advice.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/best-streaming-service-deals-133028980.html?src=rss",
    "full_text": "With that said, these are the best streaming deals you can snag right now. Purchased separately, you’d pay $22 per month for both of the services. NBA League Pass student discount — one year for $120 (40 percent off): Students can get one year of League Pass for only $10 per month, which includes access to NBA TV and the ability to watch classic and archive games on-demand. The deal requires annual verification and is open to those who work for either private or public institutions. These bundles offer you access to more content with one subscription price, but those prices are typically higher than paying for a single service by itself (obviously). Speaking of a deep love for a single streaming service: if all of your favorite shows are on Peacock or the latest releases on HBO Max consistently bring you joy, consider paying for one year upfront. Subscribing with an annual plan usually saves you money in the long term over paying on a monthly basis. You’ll save 43 percent with this bundle, as opposed to paying for all three services individually. You’ll save 42 percent with this bundle, as opposed to paying for both ad-free tiers individually.

    "summary": "If your PlayStation 5’s internal storage is starting to feel a little cramped, you’re not alone. With game installs regularly taking up over 100GB, expanding your storage is one of the easiest ways to get more out of your console. The best SSD for PS5 will not only give you extra space for your game library, but it should also meet Sony’s speed requirements so your games load just as fast as they would on the built-in drive.There’s a wide range of SSDs to choose from, whether you want a simple plug-and-play option with a heatsink or a budget-friendly pick where you add your own. Some offer better cooling, others come with software tools for managing performance — but all the drives we’ve included here are compatible, fast and reliable. Here’s what to look out for when upgrading your PS5 storage, and our top picks to help you get started.Read more: These are the best SSDs in 2025\nTable of contents\n\nBest SSDs for PS5 in 2025\nHow we test PS5 SSDs\nPS5 SSD FAQs\n\nBest SSDs for PS5 in 2025\n \n \n \n \nHow we test PS5 SSDs\nI’ve tested most of the SSDs recommended on this list, either for PS5 or computer use. I also bought and used our top pick in my own PS5. \nPS5 SSD FAQs\nHow much PS5 storage do I need?\nThe PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 5 Pro can accept internal drives with between 250GB and 8TB of storage capacity. If you already own a PS5, chances are you have a reasonable idea of how much storage you need ​​for your game library. If you’re buying an SSD with a new PS5 or PS5 Pro, or buying for someone else, it’s more difficult to tell what you might need for a high-performance experience.\nPS5 games are smaller on average than their PS4 equivalents, typically taking up between 30GB and 100GB, with some notable (and very popular) exceptions. If you’re a fan of the Call of Duty series, installing Black Ops 6 and Warzone 2.0 can eat up to 240GB. In other words, a full Call of Duty install will take up more than one-third of the PS5’s internal storage. If you’re not a CoD fan, though, chances are you’ll be good to store between six to 10 games on a regular PS5 internally before running into problems.\nYou also need to consider your internet speed. If you live in an area with slow broadband, the “you can just download it again” rationale doesn’t really work. At my old home, a 100GB download took me around eight hours, during which time it was difficult to simultaneously watch Twitch or, say, publish articles about upgrading PS5 SSDs. Keeping games around on the off-chance you’ll want to play them at some point makes sense.\n\n\n\n\n   Aaron Souppouris / Engadget \n \n\nOff the bat, there's basically no point in going for a 250GB PS5 SSD. Economically, 250GB drives aren’t that much cheaper than 500GB ones — and practically, that really isn’t a lot of space for modern games to live on. 500GB drives can be a decent option, but after years of declining prices, I think the sweet spot for most people is to opt for a high-capacity 1TB or 2TB drive, which should run you at most $200. The latter will more than double the PS5 Pro’s storage without breaking the bank.\nUnless you’re rolling in cash and want to flex, 4TB and 8TB models should mostly be avoided, as you’ll end up paying more per gigabyte than you would with a 1TB or 2TB drive.\nWhile the 825GB PS5 only provides 667GB of storage, that’s largely due to storage being reserved for the operating system and caching. If you install a 1TB PS5 SSD, you'll have, within a margin of error, 1TB of storage available for games. Out of the box, the PS5 Pro offers 1.86TB of storage for games, though you can eke out more if you delete the pre-installed Astro’s Playroom (gasp).\nSince neither the PS5 Slim nor PS5 Pro feature updated CPU architecture, all of our recommendations will work with whatever PS5 model you own.\nCan you play PS5 games on an external SSD?\nExternal hard drives tend to cost less than internal SSD counterparts (and there’s a good chance you might own one already). Unfortunately, there are restrictions on what you can do with them. An external SSD connects to your PS5 via USB, and is only suitable for playing PlayStation 4 games, or storing PS5 titles. That’s useful if you have anything but the best high-speed internet — it’s faster to move a PS5 game out of “cold storage” on an external drive than it is to re-download it — or want to keep your PS4 library on hand.\nDue to the limitations here, you don’t need the highest-performing model, although you should opt for SSDs over HDDs for improved transfer speeds and load times. Any basic portable drive from a reputable brand will do, with the Crucial X9 Pro and Samsung T7 being options we’ve tried and can recommend.\nWhich SSD cards are compatible with the PS5?\nThe official answer to this question is an “M.2 Socket 3 (Key M) Gen4 x4 NVME SSD.” But even within that seemingly specific description, there are additional factors to consider. The main requirements Sony has laid out for compatibility come down to speed, cooling and physical dimensions.\nFor speed, Sony says drives should be able to handle sequential reads at 5,500MB/s. Early testing showed that the PS5 would accept drives as slow as 4,800MB/s, and that games that tap into the SSD regularly — such as Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart — would cause no issues. Pretty much the only thing the PS5 will outright reject is one that doesn't match the Gen4 x4 spec.\nIn our opinion, though, using a drive slower than the specification is a risk that, if you don’t already have that drive lying around, is not worth taking. Just because we haven’t found issues yet doesn’t mean there won’t be games that could be problematic in the future. The price difference between these marginally slower Gen4 drives and the ones that meet Sony’s spec isn’t huge, and you might as well cover all your bases.\nSlightly more complicated than speed is cooling and size. Most new SSDs are going to be just fine; the PS5 can fit 22mm-wide SSDs of virtually any length (30mm, 40mm, 60mm, 80mm or 110mm, to be precise). The vast majority of drives you find will be 22mm wide and 80mm long, so no problem there.\nIt should be noted that the system can fit a 25mm-wide drive, but that width must include the cooling solution. Speaking of, Sony says SSDs require “effective heat dissipation with a cooling structure, such as a heatsink.” The maximum height supported by Sony’s slot is 11.25mm, of which only 2.45mm can be “below” the drive.\nThis previously meant some of the most popular heatsinked Gen4 SSDs, including Corsair’s MP600 Pro LP, would not fit within the PS5’s storage expansion slot. Since Engadget first published this guide in 2021, most NVMe makers, including Samsung, have come out with PlayStation-specific models that meet those requirements. That said, if you want to save some money, bare drives are often cheaper and it’s trivial to find a cooling solution that will work for the PS5.\nThe only component in an NVMe SSD that really requires cooling is the controller, which without a heatsink will happily sear a (very small) steak. Most SSDs have chips on only one side, but even on double-sided SSDs, the controller is likely to be on top, as manufacturers know it needs to be positioned there to better dissipate heat.\nSo, head to your PC component seller of choice and pick up basically anything that meets the recommended dimensions. A good search term is “laptop NVME heatsink,” as these will be designed to fit in the confines of gaming laptops, which are even more restrictive than a PS5. They’re also typically cheaper than the ones labeled as “PS5 heatsinks.”\nOne recommendation is this $6 copper heatsink, which attaches to the PS5 SSD with sticky thermal interface material. It works just fine, and in performing stress tests on a PC, we couldn’t find anything metal that didn’t keep temperatures under control. When you’re searching, just make sure the solution you go for measures no more than 25mm wide or 8mm tall (including the thermal interface material) and has a simple method of installation that’s not going to cause any headaches.\nOne last thing: When shopping for a PS5 NVMe, there’s no reason to buy a Gen5 model over a more affordable Gen4 model. As things stand, Sony’s console can’t take advantage of the new standard, and though Gen5 drives are backward compatible, they’re more expensive than their Gen4 counterparts. Just buy the fastest and highest-capacity Gen4 model you can afford.\nHow to install an SSD into your PS5\nIf you need guidance on how to install your new NVMe into your PS5 or PS5 Pro, we have a separate guide detailing all the steps here. Installation is pretty straightforward, but our how-to can help you if you're stuck. Just make note: Before attempting to add more storage via a PS5 SSD, ensure that you have Sony’s latest software installed.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/best-ssd-for-ps5-130004175.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Choosing the best Android phone can feel overwhelming as there are so many options from so many brands, it’s hard to know where to start. Unlike Apple, which sticks to its sleek lineup of iPhones, Android offers a world of variety. Whether you're eyeing the latest flagship from Samsung, a budget-friendly smartphone from Motorola or something unique with a foldable design, there’s an Android device out there to suit your needs.The beauty of Android is its flexibility. You’ll find phones with different screen sizes, camera setups, battery life and even quirky extras like stylus support or rugged builds. Plus, Android lets you customize your device to your heart's content – something Apple fans might envy. We’ve tested and researched the top Android phones to help you find the right one for your budget, lifestyle, and tech preferences.\nBest Android phones for 2025\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhat to look for in a new Android phone\nPerformance\nWhen it comes to picking our favorite Android phones, the main things we look for are pretty straightforward: good performance (both compute and AI), a nice display, solid design, sharp cameras, long battery life and a significant commitment to ongoing software support. For performance, not only do we look at benchmarks and other metrics, but we also evaluate phones based on responsiveness. Regardless of whether you’re reading, text messaging, scrolling through social media or playing a game, no one wants a gadget that feels sluggish. \nDisplay\n\n\n\n\nWhen it comes to displays, we generally prefer OLED panels that can produce rich, saturated colors with at least 600 nits of brightness, though many of our top mid-range and high-end phones can hit 1,000 nits or more. And more recently, most of our favorite devices also support screens with fast refresh rates of 90Hz or 120Hz, which adds an extra level of smoothness and fluidity.\nDesign\nNow we will admit there is a bit of subjectivity when deciding which phones look the best, but there are other design aspects like dust and water resistance or screen durability that can make a big difference to long-term survival. It’s also important to consider things like support for wireless charging, power sharing (aka reverse wireless charging) and UWB connectivity, which can have an impact on how your phone interacts with your other devices.\nCameras\nObviously, for photos we’re looking for sharp, colorful shots in both bright and low-light conditions. And we want video clips with high dynamic range, rich audio and smooth image stabilization. Extra cameras for ultra-wide and telephoto lenses are a plus. The best cameras should also include features like dedicated night modes, support for various video recording resolutions, and additional photo modes like timelapse, slow motion and more.\nBattery and software\nFinally, in terms of longevity, we’re looking for all-day battery life on devices that also delivered great results on our local video rundown test (at least 16 hours on a charge, but more is obviously better). Wireless charging capabilities have become almost ubiquitous over the past few years, and most of our top picks have this extra perk. Fast-charging is available on some Android phones, too. Finally, with people holding onto their phones longer than ever, we like to see companies commit to at least three years of software support, upgrades and regular security updates.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/best-android-phone-130030805.html?src=rss",
    "full_text": "Processor: Google Tensor G4 | Display: 6.3-inch Super Actua, up to 120Hz | Cameras: Rear array (50MP wide, 48MP ultrawide with Macro Focus, 48MP 5x telephoto lens), 42MP dual PD selfie front camera with autofocus | Battery: 4,700mAh But it was always a little too big and too cumbersome for those of us who have smaller hands or want our phones to fit in our pockets. Instead of a relatively large 6.8-inch screen like that on its bigger sibling, the standard Pro has a 6.3-inch display that is easy to maneuver. Better yet, with the Pixel 9 Pro, Google hasn't sacrificed any key feature to get to the smaller size, meaning you'll find the same camera setup and performance in both handsets. But the Pixel 9 Pro is also much longer-lasting than the XL, notching almost 25 hours on our battery test. Those distinctions aside, the Pixel 9 Pro lineup is our favorite Android phone because of its top-notch camera performance, intriguing AI features and a general grown-up vibe. While previous Pixel flagships had a colorful, blocky design that felt fresh, this year's devices feel solid and refined. Without the camera bars, they would be pretty hard to tell apart from Apple's phones. The Pixel 9 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro both start at $999, and though some of us have come to think of Google's handsets as the more competitively priced option, this year's model might be good enough to justify a premium price. If you still want something from the Pixel 9 family but don't want to pay $1,000, the base Pixel 9 is still a solid handset for most people."

But, it soon becomes pretty clear that there's a consequence for this. Earth is spinning faster and faster… and faster, and protestors blame CWC and the orbital circuit its travel system relies on. The days grow shorter, the climate events become more extreme and everything is hurtling toward disaster. Circular Motion follows Tanner, a kid from smalltown Alaska who lands a job at CWC, Winnie, a girl who has truly been through it, and Columbia professor Victor Bickle, who shot to viral fame after predicting a public infrastructure catastrophe. They're all connected, as we piece together through multiple POVs.

    "summary": "OpenAI has achieved \"gold medal-level performance\" at the International Math Olympiad, notching another important milestone for AI's fast-paced growth. Alexander Wei, a research scientist at OpenAI working on LLMs and reasoning, posted on X that an experimental research model delivered on this \"longstanding grand challenge in AI.\"\nAccording to Wei, an unreleased model from OpenAI was able to solve five out of six problems at one of the world's longest-standing and prestigious math competitions, earning 35 out of 42 points total. The International Math Olympiad (IMO) sees countries send up to six students to solve extremely difficult algebra and pre-calculus problems. These exercises are seemingly simple but usually require some creativity to score the highest marks on each problem. For this year's competition, only 67 of the 630 total contestants received gold medals, or roughly 10 percent.\nAI is often tasked with tackling complex datasets and repetitive actions, but it usually falls short when it comes to solving problems that require more creativity or complex decision-making. However, with the latest IMO competition, OpenAI says its model was able to handle complicated math problems with human-like reasoning.\n\"By doing so, we've obtained a model that can craft intricate, watertight arguments at the level of human mathematicians,\" Wei wrote on X. Wei and Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, both added that the company doesn't expect to release anything with this level of math capability for several months. That means the upcoming GPT-5 will likely be an improvement from its predecessor, but it won't feature that same impressive capability to compete in the IMO.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/openais-experimental-model-achieved-gold-at-the-international-math-olympiad-182719801.html?src=rss",
