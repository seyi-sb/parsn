    "summary": "Amazon Prime Day 2025 is almost a wrap, so Prime members should take advantage of the long-awaited discounts across Amazon’s site today. The online retailer has hosted its main, annual shopping event in July (almost) without fail for a decade, and it typically brings some of the best prices of the year to clothing, household goods, and yes, even consumer electronics.\nThis year is no different — a number of our top picks for the best tech you can buy right now have been discounted for Prime Day. Most Prime Day deals are exclusively available to Prime members, but there are always a few stragglers that anyone with an Amazon account can get. We’ve gathered the best Prime Day deals on tech that we could find here for the final day of the sale. \nPrime Day deals: Engadget's top picks\nApple AirPods Pro 2 for $149 (40 percent off): The AirPods Pro 2 remain Apple’s best set of wireless earbuds, as they offer the full set of Apple-focused features, strong ANC, onboard volume controls, a comfy in-ear design and a warm sound profile that most should find agreeable. They can even work as a hearing aid now.\nSamsung 55-inch The Frame QLED 4K smart TV for $758 (49 percent off): This is the set that spurred all of the art TV copycats, and it's been a favorite of our staff for a long time. Samsung's set looks like a piece of art hanging on your wall when you're not watching TV, and you can cycle through thousands of images to show on the TV so you'll always have something new to display.\nJisulife Life7 handheld fan for $23 (21 percent off): Jisulife makes handheld fans we've recommended in past gift guides and this is one of its newer models. It can be held, folded so it sits flat on a table or worn around your neck for a cool breeze wherever you're going. It has an easy-to-read display in its center that will show you the fan speed level or current battery life, and its 5,000 mAh battery can last up to 19.5 hours on a single charge when you're running the fan on its lowest setting.\nLeebein Electric Spin Scrubber for $38 (46 percent off): This was my favorite thing I bought last year because it makes the must-detested chore of cleaning my shower less of a pain. It's an electric spin scrubber that comes with multiple cleaning heads so you can use it on your countertops, sinks, tubs and showers and more. It also has an adjustable arm so you can reach tough spots in hard-to-reach places, and it convenient recharges via USB-C.\nSamsung SmartTag 2 for $15.50 (48 percent off): Samsung users looking to keep track of their stuff need look no further than the SmartTag 2. One of our top picks for the best Bluetooth trackers, this accessory easily attaches to keys, bags and other items and uses Samsung's large finding network to show you their last known location.\nSony WH-1000XM5 headphones for $248 (38 percent off): While the XM6 headphones are the latest and greatest, they only make small changes to the already stellar XM5. These were our top pick for the best wireless headphones for a long time before the XM6 launched earlier this year, and we still like them for their excellent sound quality, strong ANC, multi-device connectivity and good battery life. Note that the black model is the only one down to $248 at the moment; all other colors are on sale for $298.\nDyson V15 Detect Plus for $570 ($180 off): You can't get much better than a Dyson if you're on the market for a cordless stick vacuum, and the V15 Detect delivers. It's our current top pick for the best cordless vacuum overall thanks to its excellent suction power, lightweight design, good battery life and the included Fluffy Optic cleaning head that uses a laser to show you where all the debris is while you're using it.\nNintendo Switch 2 + Mario Kart World bundle for $500: We'd be remiss if we didn't mention the fact that Amazon has the Nintendo Switch 2 available to order \"by invitation\" now. The Mario Kart World bundle is listed at the standard $500 price, so it's not a Prime Day deal per se, but considering Amazon was (supposedly) shut out of the initial Switch 2 order process earlier this year, it's notable to see the console listed on the site at all.\nPrime Day deals under $50\n\n\nAmazon Fire TV Stick HD for $18 (49 percent off): Our favorite budget streaming stick, the Fire TV Stick HD is an easy, dirt-cheap way to upgrade an aging TV set. It supports HD video and its revamped remote can control the power and volume of your TV, so you don't have to keep track of two controllers.\nAnker iPhone Nano Power Bank with Built-in USB-C Connector for $20 ($10 off): One of these little guys could represent the difference between a dead phone and a not-dead phone. It’s the size of an oldey-timey lipstick case and delivers a partial charge to any USB-C phone. We tested it out and awarded it a spot in our guide to power banks.\nAmazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max for $35 ($25 off): This stick handles Dolby Vision, Dolby Atmos, 4K video and HDR10+ and supports Wi-Fi 6E. It has the fastest processor of any Fire TV Stick and Engadget’s Jeff Dunn has gotten a lot of use from the stick as a retro gaming emulator. Of course, Amazon’s user interface is less elegant (and less democratic) than others. And it highly prioritizes Prime Video content.\nLexar Professional Silver Plus for $38 ($35 off): Our tests showed this to be the fastest microSD card on the market, beating out the whole Samsung line. Not only is it fast enough to download and upload 4K files without trying your patience, it's also waterproof, cheap and squeezes in both USB-A and USB-C ports.\nAmazon Echo Spot for $45 (44 percent off): Amazon revived the Spot smart alarm clock last year, which features a half-circle shaped display that shows the time, weather and other information like song titles when you're using the speaker to play music. It has a compact design that will make it easy to fit on a desk or a nightstand, and as with any Alexa smart speaker, you can use it to control IoT devices like smart lights, locks and more.\nPrime Day Apple deals\n\n\nApple Watch Series 10 for $280 ($120 off): We consider Apple’s flagship wearable to be the best smartwatch you can buy, period. It's a mostly iterative update, with faster charging, a slightly slimmer design and a marginally larger display than the prior Series 9. That said, it's still a comprehensive fitness tracker, and no other smartwatch can integrate as neatly with iPhones and other Apple devices.\nApple iPad Air (11-inch, M3) for $479 ($120 off): In our opinion, the iPad Air is the best iPad for most people as it strikes an ideal balance between performance, price and features. The M3 chip is almost overkill for a tablet, but it means performance should never be an issue. And upcoming productivity gains from iPadOS 26 should make the tablet even more powerful.\nApple iPad (A16) for $280 (20 percent off): The latest base model iPad comes with a faster A16 chip, 2GB more RAM and 128GB of storage as standard. It earned a score of 84 in our review — if you only need an iPad for roaming the internet, watching shows and doing some lighter productivity tasks, it's a good starter tablet.\nPrime Day audio deals\n\n\nSony WH-CH720N headphones for $78 (48 percent off): The cheapest Sony headphones we'd recommend that are no slouch. They're lightweight and comfy with respectable sound for the price. You also get Adaptive Sound Control, 360 Reality Audio and multipoint Bluetooth on this budget model.\nBeats Pill for $99 (34 percent off): The Beats Pill is one of the few portable bluetooth speakers we liked enough to give it a full review. Those of you who love the classic Beats bluetooth speakers will be happy to know they're back in fine form. Nobody can beat the Pill for bass, and its sound is crisp and lossless at almost any frequency and volume. For some reason, only the Kim Kardashian branded version is on sale, but it's the exact same speaker.\nGoogle Pixel Buds Pro 2 for $160 (30 percent off): The best earbuds for Pixel phone users are down to $160, which makes them a great purchase right now. Live translate and hands-free access to Gemini might be the highlight, but these earbuds have great sound and capable ANC too.\nSonos Beam Gen 2 for $369 (26 percent off): The second-gen Beam soundbar has support for Dolby Atmos and it has a relatively streamlined design that should be easy to fit into most home entertainment setups.\nPrime Day laptop deals\n\n\nMicrosoft Surface Laptop (13.8-inch, Snapdragon X Plus) for $880 (27 percent off): In addition to running on a Snapdragon X Plus processor, this 2024 Surface Laptop has 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD. It's a Copilot+ PC that also has a 13.8-inch touchscreen, and it should last up to 20 hours on a single charge.\nGoogle Pixelbook Go (13-inch, Intel Core M3) for $319 (51 percent off): The Pixelbook Go is a bit old at this point, but if you're a Chrome OS lover and want a Google-made laptop, this is a solid option. It includes an Intel Core M3 processor, 8GB of RAM, 64GB of storage and a 12-hour battery life.\nPrime Day tech deals\n\n\nRing Doorbell Battery + Indoor Cam 2 for $70 (50 percent off): If you're looking to build out a security system in your home, this bundle is a good place to start, giving you a video doorbell and an indoor security camera. You'll be able to see both live feeds in the Ring app, and they can send you motion alerts and let you speak to people on the other end of the camera when you're not at home.\nKindle for $85 ($25 off): Our favorite budget option in our guide to the best ereaders, the latest base Kindle has 16GB of storage — more than enough to hold hundreds of books at a time. It has a compact and durable design that’s easy to take anywhere, and the latest model is faster than before with speedy page turns and a more seamless navigation between books, your library and other parts of the UI.\nCrucial X9 Pro 2TB for $120 ($60 off): The Crucial X9 Pro with 2TB storage space is marked down 33 percent for Prime Day. It's our top pick for the best portable SSD right now thanks to its excellent speeds, compact yet rugged design and five-year warranty.\nSamsung 990 Pro for $150 (29 percent off): The whole Samsung Pro line of SSDs is excellent for gamers, with PS5s in particular seeming to run much faster with one installed. The 990 Pro can reach read speeds of up to 1,400 KB/s — and yes, that's kilobytes, not megabytes.\nNinja Dual-Zone air fryer (10 quart) for $160 ($90 off): This model is one of our favorite air fryers thanks to its dual-zone cooking system, which allows you to prepare two separate foods at different temperatures and settings. There's even a Match Cook feature that ensures both foods will be done at the same time, regardless of their cooking settings.\nLevoit Core 400S air purifier for $183 ($37 off): Our top pick for the best air purifier, Levoit's Core 400S reliably improved air quality in our testing, plus it has easy to use onboard controls and replaceable filters that are not too expensive. We also found it to not be offensively loud, even on its highest setting.\niRobot Roomba 104 Combo robot vacuum and mop for $250 (44 percent off): This combo machine will vacuum and mop on its own, plus it comes with an auto-empty base as well. That means it will automatically empty the dry debris it collects into the base after every cleaning job.\nKindle Scribe for $260 ($140 off): The Scribe is one of the best E-Ink tablets you can buy at the moment, and certainly the top pick if you want a writable table that also excels as an ereader. It provides a great reading and writing experience, thanks in part to its ability to access the entire Kindle ebook library, and it has handy Google Drive, Microsoft OneDrive and Dropbox integration.\nHisense S7N CanvasTV (65-inch) for $898 (31 percent off): Hisense's spin on Samsung's Frame sets, the CanvasTV, comes in much cheaper and with a boatload of features. The S7N sports an anti-glare display and art mode, as you'd expect, but there's also 144Hz support for a bit of gaming. It also comes with a slim wall mount so you can hang it on your wall like a genuine work of art. (The 55-inch model is also a great deal at $689, and the 77-inch is down to $1,399.)\nSamsung The Frame Pro (65-inch) for $1,850 (16 percent off): New for 2025, Samsung's Frame Pro sets offer brighter and higher-quality Mini LED panels for a superior TV watching experience. The 65-inch Frame Pro is a great option for most living rooms since it's large enough to deliver an immersive viewing experience, and it also comes with Samsung's wireless One Connect box for less cable clutter. While there's still no OLED Frame TV yet, this Mini LED set is the closest you'll get today. (If you're looking for something larger, the 75-inch Frame Pro is down to $2,699, and the 85-inch is $4,061.)\nWhat is Prime Day?\nPrime Day is Amazon's members-only shopping event, which means you’ll have to be a Prime subscriber on Prime Day to take advantage of most of the savings. Amazon still offers a 30-day free trial to new Prime subscribers, so you can start your free trial closer to July and participate in the event.\nWhen is Prime Day 2025?\nAmazon Prime Day 2025 will be back this year on July 8 through July 11.\nHow often is Prime Day?\nAmazon Prime Day typically comes around annually in July. In the last few years, Amazon has also had its \"Big Deal Days\" in October, which is effectively a second Prime Day and the unofficial kickoff to the holiday shopping season.\nHow does Prime Day work?\nPrime subscribers can go to Amazon's site on Prime Day to see all of the exclusive deals they have access to. Prime subscribers do not have to do anything additional to get Prime Day sales: the discounts you see on product pages will show up in your cart automatically. If you're not a Prime subscriber and you go to Amazon to shop on Prime Day, you'll likely see tons of items on sale but only \"with Prime;\" those discounts will not be available to those who are not active Prime subscribers.\nIs Prime Day only for Prime members?\nTechnically yes, but even if you do not pay for a Prime membership, you should still check out Amazon on Prime Day. While most Prime Day deals will be exclusively available to subscribers, there are always a handful of sales available to all shoppers. Amazon distinguishes between them very clearly: you'll see \"Prime exclusive\" on product pages near the deal pricing on the discounts that are only available to paying members.\nSeparately, it’s very likely that other retailers like Walmart, Target and Best Buy will have their own competing Prime Day sales during that time frame, too. So if you're not keen on shopping at Amazon at all, it's worth checking out other retailers during the week of Prime Day to see if they are matching Prime Day deal prices.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-amazon-prime-day-deals-for-the-last-day-our-top-picks-on-headphones-tvs-robot-vacuums-and-more-120028336.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Amazon’s big sale is almost ending (today is the last day) and these are the best Prime Day Kindle deals on the site. Currently, Amazon makes four models of its ereader: the basic Kindle, the writing-enabled Scribe, the colorized Colorsoft and the premium Paperwhite, which also comes in an even fancier Signature edition. All of them are currently on sale and many are going for their lowest prices ever. Just note that you'll have to be a Prime member to take advantage of the deals. Members can also save on a subscription to Kindle Unlimited. We've linked to our reviews too so you can read up before diving into these Prime Day Kindle deals.  \n\n\nBest Prime Day deals on Kindle ereaders\n\n\nAmazon Kindle for $85 ($25 off with Prime): The base model Kindle is our recommendation for the best budget ereader. Even when it’s not on sale, it’s the most affordable e-book device from a major manufacturer. It’s compact and durable making it easy to carry. It doesn’t have warm LEDs and it’s not waterproof but it’s the most affordable way to access Amazon’s vast e-book ecosystem. \nKindle case (fabric) for $24 (25 percent off with Prime): If you want to protect your new ereader, you can grab this case while it's 25 percent off. Note that only the blue and pink versions are $24, the black and matcha versions are $2 more expensive. \nKindle Colorsoft for $180 ($100 off with Prime): Amazon didn’t introduce color to its ereader lineup until early this year — long after Kobo and Boox. The list price of $280 makes it more expensive than other color display ereaders, but this discount helps with that. We appreciate the fast page turns, pinch to zoom feature and auto-adjusting warm front light.\nKindle Scribe 2 for $260 ($140 off with Prime): If you want a Kindle that lets you write as well as read, this is the one to get. We gave the Kindle Scribe 2 a score of 86 in our review and it’s our pick for the best e-reader E Ink tablet. It has a smooth reading and writing experience with low latency. It also lets you create multiple notebooks, add pages and change the templates easily.\nKindle Paperwhite for $125 ($35 off with Prime): The Paperwhite is an elevated version of the Kindle, with a larger, seven-inch, flush-front screen and an adjustable warm front light. A faster processor gives it quicker page turns than its predecessor and the device itself is waterproof.\nKindle Paperwhite Signature Edition for $150 ($50 off with Prime): The Signature Edition adds few more premium features to the Kindle Paperwhite with wireless charging, an auto-adjusting front light and more storage (32GB). We gave it an 85 in our review praising the premium build, remarkably clear text and fast page turns. We just wish the power button wasn’t on the bottom.\nKindle Kids for $95 ($35 off with Prime): The Kindle Kids edition is the same hardware as the standard Kindle, but you get a few added perks that are fitting for younger users. To start, a case comes standard. The warranty is extended to two years. And the purchase price includes a six month subscription to Amazon Kids+ for thousands of kid-friendly ebooks and more.\nKindle Paperwhite Kids for $130 ($50 off with Prime): Again, the kids version is the same as the Paperwhite but with a cover, extended warranty and access to Amazon Kids+ for six months. Just remember to cancel at the end of the trial or keep it and pay $6 per month.\nBest Prime Day deals on non-Kindle ereaders\nBoox Palma 2 for $270 ($30 off): This smartphone-shaped device is a delight. It’s built on Android and can run just about any app you can download from the Play Store — just don’t expect it to play video or graphics-intensive games. This is an E Ink screen, after all. But it’s perfect for reading books and running simple apps in a more eye-friendly format.\nKobo Libra Color for $210 ($40 off): Our favorite ereader with buttons has a premium, waterproof build that’s very comfortable to hold. The touch controls and buttons are responsive and deeply customizable. The color display brings more life to book covers and graphic novels, and it’s even stylus-enabled if you want to scribble on your books. This is the lowest price in a few months, but note that it dropped to $200 in January.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/last-chance-prime-day-deals-get-up-to-36-percent-off-kindles-and-ereaders-080957317.html?src=rss",

It applies to both the ad-supported Essential plan and the ad-free Premium subscription. This saves new users $14 for Essential and a whopping $24 for Premium over two months. I suggest going with Premium because ads suck and you can always downgrade or cancel later once the regular price kicks in. \n\n\nParamount+ is a decent service and made our list of the best streaming platforms. It started as a home for all things Star Trek, but that particular bonus is shrinking all of the time. It was recently announced that Star Trek: Strange New Worlds will end after a truncated season five, leaving just the forthcoming Starfleet Academy.

Paramount owns CBS, so subscribers can also access much of that network's programming.

    "summary": "Regardless of if you need a new laptop for the upcoming semester or for general use at home, Amazon Prime Day may have just what you’re looking for at a good price. Amongst the clothing, shoes, household essentials and other tech gear are some decent laptop deals that you can snag if you’re a Prime member — and even some that you can grab without a Prime subscription.\nBut deciphering what constitutes a “good deal” on a laptop during Prime Day can be a bit challenging. That’s due in part to the manic nature of laptop prices on Amazon in particular: they fluctuate often depending on model, brand, configuration, seller and more. But Engadget can help by collecting all of the best Prime Day laptop deals here so you don’t have to go searching for them. \nPrime Day laptop deals: MacBooks\nApple’s latest laptops are the MacBook Air M4 and the MacBook Pro M4, but the M3-powered machines are still available and great values when you can get them at steep discounts. But for the most future-proof options, we recommend going with the M4 MacBooks. Amazon actually has decent MacBook deals throughout the year, most of the time on the base configurations of any given model. In a welcomed update, Apple recently made all base models of the MacBook Air M4 have 16GB of RAM by default (which is the same as you’ll find on the base-level Pros).\n\n\n\nMacBook Air (15-inch, M4, 16GB RAM, 256GB SSD) for $1,049 ($150 off)\nMacBook Air (15-inch, M3, 24GB RAM, 512GB SSD) for $1,299 (24 percent off)\nMacBook Pro (14-inch, M4, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD) for $1,429 (11 percent off)\n\nPrime day laptop deals: Windows laptops\nYou’ve got a lot of variety to choose from when it comes to Windows laptops, and that can be a blessing or a curse. We recommend looking for a laptop from a reputable brand (i.e. Microsoft, Dell, Acer, Lenovo and others like them), and one that can handle daily work or play pressures. That means at least 8GB of RAM and 245GB of SSD storage, plus the latest Intel or AMD CPUs. If you’re looking for a new gaming laptop, you’ll need a bit more power and a dedicated graphics card to boot. Now is a good time to consider upgrading as well since Windows 10 will be sunset in October this year and Microsoft has recommended users upgrade to newer Windows 11 laptops.\n\n\n\nSamsung Galaxy Book5 360 (Windows 11, Copilot+, 15.6-inch, Intel Core Ultra 7, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD) for $1,050 (22 percent off)\nMicrosoft Surface laptop (Windows 11, Copilot+, 13.8-inch, Snapdragon X Plus) for $880 (27 percent off)\nLenovo V15 G2 laptop (Windows 11 Pro, 15.6-inch, Intel Celeron N4500, 32GB RAM, 1TB SSD) for $429 (28 percent off)\nMicrosoft Surface Pro 2-in-1 (Windows 11, Copilot+, 13-inch, Snapdragon X Plus, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD) for $870 (28 percent off)\nDell Inspiron 3520 laptop (Windows 11, 15.6-inch, Intel Core i5, 8GB RAM, 512GB SSD) for $350 (22 percent off)\nAcer Nitro V gaming laptop (Windows 11, 15.6-inch, Intel Core i5, RTX 4050, 8GB RAM, 512GB SSD) for $650 ($150 off)\nASUS ROG Strix G16 gaming laptop (Windows 11, Intel Core i9, RTX 4060, 16GB RAM, 1TB SSD) for $1,360 ($340 off)\n\nPrime Day laptop deals: Chromebooks\nMost Chromebooks start off pretty affordable, so that just means you can get them for even less during an event like Prime Day. If you’re a Chrome OS lover, it’s also a decent time to check out sales on premium Chromebooks, which can usually cost $500 or more. In general, we recommend looking for at least 4 to 8GB of RAM and at least 128GB of SDD storage in a Chromebook that you plan on using as your daily driver.\n\n\n\nHP Chromebook 14 (14-inch, Intel N100, 8GB RAM, 128GB UFS) for $200 (49 percent off)\nGoogle Pixelbook Go (13-inch, Intel Core M3, 8GB RAM, 64GB storage) for $319 (51 percent off)\nAcer Chromebook Plus 514 (14-inch, Intel Core i3, 8GB RAM, 128GB SSD) for $330 (18 percent off)\nHP Chromebook Plus x360 (14-inch, Intel Core i3, 8GB RAM, 128GB UFS) for $326 (46 percent off)\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/prime-day-laptop-deals-save-on-macbooks-windows-11-machines-chromebooks-and-others-before-the-sale-ends-130057009.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "It doesn't take much to play games these days. Phone, console, PC or handheld are all viable options. But why play using the bare minimum when you can upgrade your setup on the cheap by snagging a deal or two during Amazon Prime Day. Just a couple of key improvements can make a huge impact on how you enjoy a game or even how you play it. But instead of wasting your free time combing through thousands of listings yourself, we've collected the best gaming discounts and promos into a single place so you can get back to the action as fast as possible.\nBest Prime Day deals on video games\n\n\nThe Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom (Nintendo Switch) for $52 ($8 off) \nWe rarely see discounts on first-party Nintendo games, especially when it comes to major franchises like The Legend of Zelda. But for Prime Day, Echoes of Wisdom is available for 15 percent off, which is even more impressive when you consider the game the game is less than a year old. Not only is this the first Zelda game to put our beloved princess in the spotlight (instead of Link), it offers a fun twist on the series' classic top-down action RPG formula thanks to Zelda's new ability to summon objects and monsters with the Tri-rod.\nThe Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom (Nintendo Switch) for $53 ($17 off)\nAlternatively, if you are looking for something a bit faster paced, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom may be one of the best sequels in recent video game history. And now for Prime Day, it's available for $17 off its normal retail price. Not only is this a great pickup for anyone who hasn't played it yet, it's also a great showcase of the Switch 2's capabilities as users can purchase a $10 upgrade pack (or get it for free if you have a subscription to Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack) that adds support for HDR, faster loading times, enhanced textures and smoother framerates. \nStar Wars Outlaws - Limited Edition (Amazon Exclusive), PlayStation 5 for $29 ($31 off)\nAt full price, this game was easy to skip. But now that it's available for just $29 (half off its normal retail price), Star Wars Outlaws suddenly becomes a lot more interesting for fans of the franchise. You get to live out your dreams of being an intergalactic scoundrel while taking down bounties or battling secret crime syndicates. And because this is the limited edition, the game includes some pre-order rewards like the Kessel Run bonus pack and the Rogue Infiltrator bundle.\nAssassin’s Creed Shadows - Limited Edition for PS5/Xbox Series X for $48 ($22 off)\nIf you missed the latest entry in Ubisoft's most well-known franchise, this might be the time to jump in because for Prime Day, Assassin's Creed Shadows is available for $48, more than $20 off its regular retail price. This instalment has you explore feudal Japan as either the shinobi Naoe or the legendary samurai Yasuke while encountering some notable figures from the time period. If all you want is a wonderful world to sneak around in, it's hard to go wrong with Assassin's Creed on a discount.\nElden Ring: Shadow of The Erdtree Edition for PS5/Xbox Series X for $60 ($20 off)\nElden Ring is one of the most highly regarded games of this decade so far (and arguably of all time). For Prime Day, you can become a foul tarnished by picking up a version that includes the base game and the Shadow of the Erdtree expansion for $60. Elden Ring typically costs around $50 (though it's down to $30 on PS4, PS5 and Xbox Series X for Prime Day) and the DLC will usually run you another $40, so that's a decent discount compared with buying them separately — or even the Shadow of the Erdtree Edition at its regular price. \nThe Last of Us Part I – PlayStation 5 for $30 ($40 off)\nThe Last of Us is one of the greatest modern video game franchises, spawning both a critically acclaimed sequel and TV adaptation. For Prime Day, you can now get part one of the remastered version for more than 50 percent off. This latest edition for the PS5 features a brand new game engine, improved loading speeds and haptic feedback support for Sony's DualSense controller and more, which is enough to make the series feel like an entirely new experience (even if you played the original back in the day). And while it isn't getting as big of a discount, you can also pick up The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered on Amazon for just $40 (10 off its regular price).\nFinal Fantasy I-VI Collection Anniversary Edition for PlayStation and Switch for $66 ($9 off)\nThis collection of pixel remasters of the first six Final Fantasy games is discounted by $9 during Prime Day. Several other games in the series are on sale for PS5 as well, such as Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade ($30, $10 off), Final Fantasy VII Rebirth ($40, $30 off) and Final Fantasy XVI ($25, $15 off)\nBest Prime Day deals on VR headsets\nMeta Quest 3S 128GB Bundle for $249 ($51 off)\nThe Quest 3S is one of our picks for best VR headsets for good reason. Meta cut just the right corners from the more full-featured Quest 3, enabling it to drop the list price down lower. It has the same Snapdragon chip and controlers, but cheaps out a bit on the lenses, slightly lowering the graphics fidelity in use. Just like the Quest 3, it works standalone for lighter games and streaming, or in concert with a gaming PC for full-fat AAA VR titles. It's well worth the $300 Meta usually asks for it, so at $249 with two games included (Cardboard Hero and the excellent social VR hit Gorilla Tag), it's a steal.\nBest Prime Day deals on PCs and PC components\nRazer Blade 14 with RTX 4070 for $2,300 ($400 off)\nThe Blade 14 is one of my favorite laptop lines because it combines a super sleek chassis with solid performance and truly excellent build quality. And now, as a way to get in on the Prime Day festivities, Razer has an exclusive offer on its website that will knock $400 off configs with RTX 4070 GPUs or up to $300 on models with RTX 4060 cards. These kind of savings go a long way towards neutralizing my biggest issue with Razer's laptops: their price. So if you're looking for a system that can do some serious gaming but is still easy to carry around, you're going to want to snap this deal up fast. \nAMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D 16-Core processor for $664 ($35 off)\nAMD's X3D chips are the cream of the crop when it comes to gaming performance and while it's only enjoying a $35 discount right now, informed buyers know that the real savings are bigger than that because these chips often go for well above their MSRP. But the best thing is that for Prime Day, in addition to the 9950X3D, there are a bunch of other X3D processors on sale right now including the $460 Ryzen 7 9800X3D and $265 Ryzen 7 5700X3D so you can pick the right component for your budget. If you need a new CPU to speed up your gaming rig, now is a great time to upgrade.\nASUS ROG Strix G16 Gaming Laptop with RTX 4060 for $1,360 ($340 off)\nWhile an RTX 4060 isn't the most powerful GPU on the market, getting a whole new laptop with solid specs for just $1,360 isn't something you can just ignore, especially if you're on a budget. This ROG Strix G16 comes with 16GB of RAM and 1TB of storage. And while its Intel Core i9-14900HX CPU is one generation old, it's still plenty fast enough for gaming, video editing or pretty much anything else you need to do. I also appreciate small features like a MUX switch that lets the laptop connect directly to the GPU for increased performance, though if you want, you can also enable automatic switching for better battery life. And with a 16-inch 240Hz QHD display with 100% DCI-P3 coverage, everything on screen is sure to look great.\nAcer Nitro V gaming laptop with NVIDIA RTX 4060 GPU for $1,200 ($150 off, lowest ever price)\nAcer's Nitro gaming laptops are meant to be more affordable alternatives to its flagship Predator systems. But now thanks to Prime Day, this model just got even more budget-friendly while still offering decent specs. You get an Intel Core i9-13900H CPU with 32GB of RAM, 1TB of storage and an RTX 4060 GPU, the latter of which should pair nicely with its 15.6-inch full HD 144Hz display. I also appreciate that unlike some gaming laptops, the Nitro V is stylish without being in your face with too many RGB lights, which makes it feel like an even better deal at $1,200. That's the lowest price we've seen to date for this configuration.\nCorsair Vengeance RGB DDR5 RAM 32GB (2x16GB) RAM for $95 ($25 off)\nAdding some extra memory to your desktop can help unlock its full potential. So for Prime Day, Corsair is offering two 16GB sticks of its Vengeance DDR5 RAM for just $95. Not only do you get built-in RGB lighting, Corsair's onboard voltage regulation makes it simpler to overclock your system. And for those who don't want to mess around in BIOS settings, you can control almost everything from the easy-to-use free iCue app.\nThermaltake GF1 (2024) Fully Modular ATX 850W Power Supply for $80 ($30 off, lowest ever price)\nEven though power supplies aren't the most exciting component you can put in your desktop, the importance of a good one can't be understated. For just $80, which is the lowest price we've seen to date for this product, the Thermaltake GF1 is fully modular (which means you can add or remove power cables as you need them) and has an ample max power of 850 watts along with an 80 Plus Gold rating for efficiency. And thanks to its 140mm fan, it should be pretty quiet, so it won't cause a ruckus if you decide to play some games at night.\nSamsung 990 EVO Plus 2TB PCIe M.2 SSD for $114 ($63 off)\nIf you're like me and are constantly running out of storage, this deal for one of Samsung's 990 EVO Plus 2TB M.2 SSDs is a fantastic way to add extra room on the cheap. With a 36 percent discount for Prime Day — down to $114 — this is the lowest price we've ever seen. And it's not like you're cutting corners on speed either, as the SSD supports both PCIe 4.0 x4 and PCIe 5.0 x2 and read/write rates of up to 7,250/6,300MB/s.\nAMD Ryzen 5 9600X 6-Core, 12-Thread Unlocked Processor for $156 ($123 off)\nThe Ryzen 5 9600X isn't super flashy, but it's a really solid budget CPU. And now, it’s even more affordable during Prime Day where it's going for just $156, which is $123 off its normal retail price. It features six cores and 12 total threads with a max boost speed of 5.4GHz and support for DDR5 RAM and PCIe Gen 5. It's also unlocked, so you have the freedom to overlock if you want. That said, you will need to buy a CPU cooler separately, as one doesn't come in the box.\nAMD Ryzen 9 9950X 16-Core, 32-Thread Unlocked Desktop Processor for $434 ($215 off)\nThe biggest issue with the Ryzen 9 9950X CPU was that at launch, it was a bit overpriced. But during Prime Day, that problem is being addressed thanks to a $215 discount that brings its cost down to under $500. The CPU features 16 cores and 32 threads along with 80MB of cache and support for DDR5 RAM and PCIe Gen 5. However, like some of AMD's other processors on sale this week, you will need to get a CPU cooler separately.\nBest Prime Day deals on gaming peripherals\nRazer Enki Gaming Chair for $450 ($50 off)\nIf you're going to be spending all day in front of a screen gaming, you better make sure whatever you're sitting on is super comfy. And as I've been using the Razer Enki every day for the last four years, I can attest that this chair is worth the money. It has a ton of adjustability for things like the arm rests, seat height and more. For more flexible folks, it was even designed so people can sit cross-legged. I also appreciate that in homes where neon green might not fit your vibe, there's an all-black model (plus a pink one too, though that one is currently sold out).\nSteelSeries Arctis Nova Pro wireless headset for $323 ($50 off)\nSteelSeries makes some of the most comfortable headsets I've ever used thanks to the super soft earcups equipped on every pair. But what separates the Arctis Nova Pro from lesser competitors is support for premium features like 360-degree spatial audio, strong noise cancellation and a hot swap battery system. Butthe best feature is SteelSeries' dedicated base station, which features an OLED screen, physical knobs and dual USB ports so you can connect your headset to multiple devices and swap between audio sources with the touch of a button.\nElgato Stream Deck MK.2 for $110 ($40 off, lowest ever)\nIf you've ever dreamed about becoming a gaming streamer or simply want some extra customizable controls for your PC, Elgato's Stream Deck MK.2 could make a great addition to your setup. It has 15 programmable macro keys with built-in LCD displays so you can make custom buttons for switching scenes, turning on lights and so much more. Elgato also has plugins for services like YouTube, Twitch, Discord, so it'll play nicely with all the major streaming platforms. In short, it's like a command center for all your content creation and livestreaming needs.\nLogitech G305 Lightspeed Wireless Gaming Mouse for $29 ($21 off)\nThe Logitech G305 Lightspeed gaming mouse is just a simple PC peripheral done well. And at just $29, it's super affordable during Prime Day too. It features six programmable buttons, compatibility with both PCs and Macs and a sensor with sensitivity of up to 12,000 DPI. Meanwhile, thanks to a battery that lasts up to 250 hours between charges, you can go weeks between needing to plug it in. And because it's wireless, there won't be any cords or cables to get in your way.\nAmazon Luna Controller and one month of Luna+ for $40 ($30 off)\nThe Luna Controller by itself is down to $40, which matches a record-low price. However, if you're a newcomer to Luna+, you may as well pick up this bundle (which is also matching a record low) for the same price, as it includes one month of access to the service for new subscribers. This gamepad is a solid option for those who want to check out Luna, Amazon's cloud gaming service. Prime subscribers get access to a dedicated channel with a rotating selection of games at no extra cost. This month, for instance, you can check out Death Stranding Director's Cut, Hollow Knight and EA Sports FC 25. \n8BitDo Retro Mechanical Keyboard for $80 ($20 off)\nWith its Retro Mechanical Keyboard, 8BitDo strikes a great balance between a nostalgic design and support for more modern features like wireless connectivity (both BT and 2.4GHz). There are several different versions to choose from, though the one inspired by the classic NES is the model I'd choose. The keyboard features an 87-key layout with PBT keycaps and Kailh Box switches, though because the PCB is hot swappable, you can always change them out for something else.\nSony Inzone H9 Wireless Gaming Headset for $198 ($102 off)\nFor anyone looking for a new pair of over-the-ear wireless gaming headphones to pair with a PS5, it's hard to do better than Sony's Inzone H9 headset. Not only does it have a similar design to the console, they are the only other headphones besides the official Pulse cans that support on-screen status notifications for volume, mic mute, game/chat balance and more. They also share a lot of the underlying tech used in Sony's iconic WH-1000XM line, so you'll get fantastic audio quality and active noise cancellation. But the best part is that at $198, you're looking at a serious discount of 34 percent, which is more than $100 off its regular retail price.\nSeagate Storage Expansion Card 2TB Solid State Drive for $209 ($21 off)\nGames are getting bigger every day, so if you need some extra storage for your Xbox Series S or X, you'd be silly not to pick up one of Seagate's 2TB Expansion Cards for just $209. That's enough room for a dozen or more digital titles (or like three versions of Call of Duty) and it's the biggest SSD storage module that slots into the back of the console without the need for a separate box.\nAmazon Basics UPS Battery Backup & Surge Protector 800VA/450W for $65 ($10 off)\nI'm not here to nag, but if you have a desktop PC, you really ought to consider adding a UPS (uninterruptible power supply) to your setup as they prevent power surges or momentary outages from knocking your system offline. Plus, this one has a beefy 450-watt battery backup and 12 outlets so you can connect all of your other PC gadgets to it. So if you're going to do the smart thing by adding some extra electrical protection to your home during Prime Day, you might as well save some money in the process.\nBest Prime Day deals on mobile gaming gear\nSamsung Galaxy S25 Ultra (512GB) for $1,055 ($365 off)\nWith Samsung's next Unpacked event expected to show off new foldables, it looks like some of the existing models are getting some serious discounts for Prime Day, including the Galaxy S25 Ultra. And at $1,055, this is the lowest price we've seen for Samsung's current flagship phone yet. For gamers, thanks to its Snapdragon 8 Elite chip, the S25 Ultra offers some of the best performance you can get in a phone right now, while its built-in vapor chamber should help prevent throttling. Its 6.9-inch AMOLED display is also one of the best mobile screens on the market today.\nRazer Kishi Ultra for $100 ($50 off)\nRazer doesn't normally run a ton of deals for Prime Day, but it seems this year the company is making an exception as there are discounts on everything from gamepads to headsets and more. That said, one of the standout deals is for the Kishi Ultra gaming controller. On top of just being a well-built gamepad add-on for phones and tablets, its larger dimension and USB-C port means it works with a huge range of devices — both Android and iOS. This even includes more niche devices like foldables like the Galaxy Z Fold series, which often don't fit inside other mobile gamepads due to their unique design.\nBest Prime Day deals on gaming monitors and TVs\nSony 85-Inch Class 4K Ultra HD Bravia 3 LED TV for $1,098 ($500 off)\nThere's no better way to upgrade your living room gaming setup than with a brand-new, big-ass TV. Granted, the Bravia 3 is one of Sony's entry-level models (fancier sets get higher numbers), but with a discounted price of $1,098 for a massive 85-inch panel, this deal represents one of the biggest screens you can get for the money. It also has Google TV built in, so you'll get a very simple and straightforward way to stream your favorite shows and movies from services like Netflix, HBO and more. But perhaps most importantly is that for PS5 owners, the Bravia 3 supports exclusive features when connected to a PS5, such as Auto HDR Tone Mapping and Auto Genre Picture mode.\nBy the way, for a more in-depth look at the best TV discounts, check out our dedicated guide covering the best TV deals for Amazon Prime Day 2025.\nLG UltraGear 32-inch OLED Dual Mode gaming monitor for $1,000 ($400 off)\nLG's dual mode 32-inch UltraGear monitor is one of the best displays for PC gaming out right now and as part of Prime Day, Best Buy has it on sale for $400 off. You can set it to 4K at 240Hz for when you want a sharp, high-resolution view. Or you can switch it to full HD, which allows its refresh rate to jump all the way up to 480Hz, which is more than enough for even the most demanding competitive gamer. It also supports AMD FreeSync Pro and because it's based on an OLED panel, you get pure blacks and vibrant colors along. The one small downside is that it doesn't have the most impressive peak brightness. But considering everything else this monitor offers, getting one for $1,000 feels like a steal.\nAlienware AW2725DF 26.7-inch OLED gaming monitor for $600 ($300 off)\nFor anyone who has been waiting for prices of OLED gaming monitors to drop, this may be your chance to pounce on a great deal. That's because at $600, Alienware's 26.7-inch OLED display strikes a good balance between price and performance with a 360Hz refresh rate, 2560 x 1440 resolution and support for AMD FreeSync Premium Pro. And of course, you get those lovely pure blacks and vivid colors that OLED panels have become known for.\nSamsung Odyssey Neo G9 Series 57-inch 4K 240Hz 4K gaming monitor for $1,600 ($700 off)\nThis 57-inch monitor isn't for people with limited space. But if you've got the room, at $1,600, this is the lowest we've ever seen the Neo G9 as this deal represents a whopping $700 savings compared to its regular list price. This thing features a solid 240Hz refresh rate along with support for AMD FreeSync Premium Pro, a 1000R curve and Quantum mini LED tech with 2,392 local dimming zones. For people who love ultra-wide displays, this should be at the top of your upgrade list during Amazon Prime Day.\nAcer Nitro 27-inch WQHD IPS gaming monitor for $170 ($120 off)\nAnyone looking for a solid and affordable 1440p gaming monitor during Prime Day should really check out this 27-inch IPS display from Acer. For just $170 (matching a record-low price), it features a relatively speedy 180Hz refresh rate along with support for AMD FreeSync Premium and a good color range that covers 95 percent of DCI-P3. The height-adjustable stand can also swivel and pivot, while thin bezels on top and on the sides will make sure it won't look dated in a few years. So while this thing isn't super fancy, it's simple and competent in the best ways.\nBest Prime Day deals on batteries and power packs\nUGREEN Magnetic Power Bank 10,000mAh fast charging battery pack for $30 ($3 off)\nThe Switch 2 is a fantastic handheld, but its longevity could be better. So if you're planning to take it on a long trip, pick up UGREEN's 10,000mAH fast charging battery pack to help keep running when you're away from a plug. This power pack almost has enough juice to fully refill a Switch 2 twice, which can add between five and 12 hours of additional game time (depending on the title). It also has an output of 20 watts, which is as much as the Switch 2 can suck down at once, but it's still super pocketable measuring just four inches long and 0.7 inches thick. And if you need a convenient way to recharge your phone, the battery pack also comes with Qi wireless support.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-prime-day-gaming-deals-on-video-games-hardware-and-more-to-get-before-the-sale-ends-144228893.html?src=rss",
    "full_text": "The Blade 14 is one of my favorite laptop lines because it combines a super sleek chassis with solid performance and truly excellent build quality. Not only do you get built-in RGB lighting, Corsair's onboard voltage regulation makes it simpler to overclock your system. And for those who don't want to mess around in BIOS settings, you can control almost everything from the easy-to-use free iCue app. But what separates the Arctis Nova Pro from lesser competitors is support for premium features like 360-degree spatial audio, strong noise cancellation and a hot swap battery system. They also share a lot of the underlying tech used in Sony's iconic WH-1000XM line, so you'll get fantastic audio quality and active noise cancellation. Plus, this one has a beefy 450-watt battery backup and 12 outlets so you can connect all of your other PC gadgets to it. Razer doesn't normally run a ton of deals for Prime Day, but it seems this year the company is making an exception as there are discounts on everything from gamepads to headsets and more. For people who love ultra-wide displays, this should be at the top of your upgrade list during Amazon Prime Day. Anyone looking for a solid and affordable 1440p gaming monitor during Prime Day should really check out this 27-inch IPS display from Acer. This power pack almost has enough juice to fully refill a Switch 2 twice, which can add between five and 12 hours of additional game time (depending on the title)."

    "summary": "If you’re considering updating your kitchen setup, first check out the best Prime Day kitchen deals we could find from Amazon’s sale. Engadget editors and reporters have tested and reviewed a whole bunch of kitchen tech and now that the sale is almost over (it ends today) it may be the last chance to save on many of the gadgets we recommend (until another sale, like Black Friday rolls around). Right now, some of our favorite Ninja air fryers, Kitchen Aid appliances, Anova sous vide machines and a Breville soda maker are on sale. We linked to our testing so you can get some background before diving in. Here are the best deals on kitchen tech in Amazon’s Prime Day sale.\nEditor's note: We've been waiting to see if Ninja's Creami ice cream maker would see a good discount. Right now, a bundle with extra containers is selling for $200, but that's still well above the low of $160 we saw as recently as January. We'll continue to monitor the sale and will update this guide if the price goes lower.  \nPrime Day air fryer deals\n\n\nNinja Foodie Dual Zone Air Fryer (10 QT) for $160 ($70 off): This is the air fryer to pick if you’ve ever wished you could air fry two different things at the same time. We named it the best dual-zone air fryer you can get — it even has a feature that makes sure the two different foods are ready at the same time. This $160 price tag is the lowest price we've seen since Black Friday last year. \nInstant Vortex Plus Air Fryer (6 QT) for $100 ($70 off): After studious testing (and dutiful eating) our reviewers named this one the best air fryer you can buy. And, after reading that assessment, I bought one myself so I can verify this is one great machine. The Odor Ease tech really does keep the cooking smells at bay and the window lets me keep an eye on all the crisping that’s going on in there.\nInstant Pot Vortex Plus Air Fryer (4QT) for $65 (50 percent off with Prime): Here’s a smaller version of the Instant air fryer we named best overall. It has a four-quart capacity, which is perfect for one person and small kitchens. And, like its larger sibling, pre-heats quickly.\nCosori Air Fryer 9-in-1 for $90 ($30 off): The runner up pick in our air fryer guide has a spacious cooking capacity yet takes up surprisingly little counter space. Little features like an intuitive touchscreen, a safety release button on the basket and an auto-pause feature set this cooker apart.\nBreville Smart Oven Air Fryer Pro for $320 ($80 off): This is the premium pick in our air fryer guide — but really, it does far more than just air fry. As our reviewer noted, its massive cubic-foot-capacity and numerous cook modes make this more like an auxiliary oven. (It can even cook an entire 14-pound turkey.) It went on sale for $300 during last year's Black Friday sales. \nInstant Vortex Plus Air Fryer (6 QT) for $100 ($70 off): After studious testing (and dutiful eating) our reviewers named this one the best air fryer you can buy. And, after reading that assessment, I bought one myself so I can verify this is one great machine. The Odor Ease tech really does keep the cooking smells at bay and the window lets me keep an eye on all the crisping that’s going on in there.\nNinja Air Fryer (4 QT) for $80 ($50 off): The budget pick from our air fryer guide isn’t currently on sale, but this four-quart Ninja fryer has twice the capacity and is nearly the same price. It can also roast and dehydrate in addition to air frying and reheating.\nCheck out our guide to air fryers to read our testing results.\nPrime Day Instant Pot and rice cooker deals\n\n\nCuckoo Twin Pressure Rice Cooker for $190 ($70 off with Prime): This is the best premium rice cooker in our guide to those machines. We like how quickly it cooks all types of rice to perfection (we tested it with long-grain white basmati, brown and sushi-grade white rice). Just keep in mind that it can be a little difficult to clean and the manual isn’t the most user-friendly.\nHamilton Beach Digital Programmable Rice Cooker for $40 ($10 off with Prime): Our top pick for a budget rice cooker is on sale for Prime members. The brown rice came out particularly good in our tests and the cooker is easy to clean with a dishwasher-safe cooker pot and steamer basket. Just note that it’s pretty small and doesn’t have the granular controls of pricer models.\nPrime Day kitchen tech deals\n\n\nOoni Volt 12 Electric Indoor Pizza Oven for $630 ($270 off) from Ooni: Note: This deal has expired at Amazon, but is still available directly from Ooni. The Volt 12 is our pick for the best indoor pizza oven — but it can be used outdoors as well thanks to its weather-resistant design. It has front-mounted controls that let you individually control the upper and lower heating elements and it can get up to 850 degrees Fahrenheit in as little as 20 minutes.  \nNinja CREAMi Ice Cream Maker (bundle) for $200 ($30 off): We said this machine “makes your frozen dreams come true.” It’s easy to use and makes thick, dense ice cream with flavors that are more intense and textures that are smoother than rival ice cream makers. Plus most of the parts are machine washable or easily rinsed. This bundle comes with extra containers and is the lowest price we’ve seen in a few months, but note that the Creami sold for $160 as recently as January.\nBreville Joule Turbo Sous Vide Machine for $200 ($50 off): The premium pick in our guide to sous vice machines has a powerful 1,100-watt heater that cuts down on cooking times. It also uses your phone as the controller (just don’t get it if you’re hoping for on-device buttons).\nAnova Sous Vide Cooker 3.0 for $138 (40 percent off): Our top pick for a sous vide machine delivers 1,100 watts of power and a flow rate of eight liters per minute which will get your water up to the right temperature faster. It also has intuitive digital touch controls and Wi-Fi connectivity.\nBreville Juice Fountain Plus for $120 ($60 off with Prime): The extraction abilities on this machine are impressive. Plus we found it relatively easy to clean (as long as you do it right after you juice). It takes up a good amount of space, but can extract an impressive amount of juice from even the driest-seeming carrot. This is the lowest price in a while, but it went down to $110 in January.\nPrime Day KitchenAid and blender deals\n\n\nKitchenAid Classic Series (4.5 QT) for $300 ($50 off): Prime Day and Black Friday sales are usually the best times to snag Kitchen Aid’s iconic mixers — unfortunately, this discount isn’t even as good as the $250 it sold for in May. Still you can save $50 on a classic appliance that we recommend in our guide to essential kitchen gadgets. These mixers are durable, reliable and, with the wide range of attachments, can truly expand your cooking arsenal.\nVitamix 5200 Blender Professional-Grade for $350 ($150 off with Prime): I can personally attest to the nearly magical abilities of Vitamix blenders. It can make chunky salsas, smooth-as-silk soups and smoothies in which the chia and hemp seeds seem to disappear into the fruit. This pro-grade model is down to the lowest price we’ve tracked this year.\nKitchenAid Variable Speed Corded Hand Blender for $55 ($15 off): We recommend the cordless version of this immersion blender in our guide to those appliances. This corded version has the same variable speed trigger which makes it easy to control your recipes. Note that this sold for $5 less as recently as May.\nVitamix E310 Explorian Blender for $330 ($50 off): Note that we've seen this go for as little as $255 in past sales, and it dropped to $300 as recently as May. But this is still a decent $50 discount on a blender that will make any food you put in it smooth. We recommend it in our guide to the best kitchen tech.\nExpired deals\nFellow Stagg EKG Pro electric kettle for $160 ($35 off with Prime): This exquisitely designed kettle has an LCD panel built into the base so you can choose a specific temperature down to the degree. And the hold feature keeps water hot for up to an hour. I bought this after reading our tea guide and have appreciated the steady pour every morning since. You’ll likely only see the sale price if you’re a Prime member.\nMannkitchen Pepper Cannon for $160 ($40 off): Not everyone needs a super expensive pepper mill. But it nonetheless became one of our reviewer’s favorite pieces of kitchen gear. A side-by-side comparison showed us just how much more pepper came out of the cannon compared to a standard store-bought mill.\nInstant Pot Duo Plus 9-in-1 (6 QT) for $70 ($70 off): Perhaps you know someone who has somehow gotten this far in life without owning an Instant Pot — perhaps that someone is you. Amazon’s Prime Day is a golden opportunity to remedy that. We named it the best multi-cooker you can buy in our guide to kitchen tech.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/amazon-prime-day-kitchen-deals-its-the-last-day-to-get-up-to-50-percent-off-air-fryers-instant-pots-blenders-and-more-180019300.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Air fryers have quickly become a go-to kitchen gadget, letting you whip up everything from crunchy fries to golden brown chicken using much less oil than traditional methods — sometimes just a drizzle of olive oil is all you need. The best air fryers in 2025 come from trusted air fryer brands and offer handy extras like digital presets, dual baskets and easy cleanup with accessories like parchment paper. Our current favorite is the Instant Vortex Plus air fryer, but there are a number of others we like that may better suit your lifestyle. Whether you're cooking for one or feeding the whole family, these air fryers deliver fast, tasty results without the mess.\nTable of contents\n\nWhat does an air fryer do?\nBest air fryers for 2025\nBuying guide for air fryers\nAir fryer pros and cons\nBest air fryer accessories\nHow to clean an air fryer\nHow to find air fryer recipes\nHow we test air fryers\n\nWhat does an air fryer do?\nLet’s clear one thing up first: it’s not frying. Not really. Air fryers are more like smaller convection bake ovens, ones that are often pod-shaped. Most work by combining a heating element and fan, which means the hot air can usually better crisp the outside of food than other methods. They often reach higher top temperatures than toaster ovens – which is part of the appeal. \nFor most recipes, a thin layer of oil (usually sprayed) helps to replicate that fried look and feel better. However, it will rarely taste precisely like the deep-fried or pan frying version when it comes out of the air fryer basket. Don’t let that put you off, though, because the air fryer, in its many forms, combines some of the best parts of other cooking processes and brings them together into an energy-efficient way of air fryer cooking dinner. Or breakfast. Or lunch.\nRead more: We’ve also rounded up the best pizza ovens and the best sous vide machines.\nBest air fryers for 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuying guide for air fryers\nConvection ovens\nYou can separate most of these machines into two types of air fryers, and each has different pros and cons. Convection ovens are usually ovens with air fryer functions and features. They might have higher temperature settings to ensure that food crisps and cooks more like actually fried food. Most convection ovens are larger than dedicated air fryers, defeating some of the purpose of those looking to shrink cooking appliance surface area. Still, they are often more versatile with multiple cooking functions, and most have finer controls for temperatures, timings and even fan speed.\nYou may never need a built-in oven if you have a decent convection oven. They often have the volume to handle roasts, entire chickens or tray bakes, and simply cook more, capacity-wise, making them more versatile than the pod-shaped competition.\nThe flip side of that is that you’ll need counter space in the kitchen to house them. It also means you can use traditional oven accessories, like baking trays or cake tins, that you might already own.\nPod-shaped air fryers\nPod-shaped air fryers are what you imagine when you think “air fryer.” They look like a cool, space-age kitchen gadget, bigger than a kettle but smaller than a toaster oven. Many use a drawer to hold ingredients while cooking, usually a mesh sheet or a more solid, non-stick tray with holes to allow the hot air to circulate. With a few exceptions, most require you to open the drawer while things cook and flip or shake half-cooked items to ensure the even distribution of heat and airflow to everything.\nThat’s one of a few caveats. This type of air fryer typically doesn't have a window to see how things are cooking (with only a few exceptions), so you’ll need to closely scrutinize things as they cook, opening the device to check progress. Basket-style air fryers also generally use less energy – there’s less space to heat – and many have parts that can be put directly into a dishwasher.\nSome of the larger pod-shaped air fryers offer two separate compartments, which is especially useful for anyone planning to cook an entire meal with the appliance. You could cook a couple of tasty chicken wings or tenders while simultaneously rustling up enough frozen fries or veggies for everyone. Naturally, those options take up more space, and they’re usually heavy enough to stop you from storing them in cupboards or shelves elsewhere.\nAs mentioned earlier, you might have to buy extra things to make these pod fryers work the way you want them to. Some of the bigger manufacturers, like Philips and Ninja, offer convenient additions, but you’ll have to pay for them.\n\n\n\n\nAir fryer pros and cons\nBeyond the strengths and weaknesses of individual models, air fryers are pretty easy to use from the outset. Most models come with a convenient cooking time booklet covering most of the major foods you’ll be air frying, so even beginners can master these machines.\nOne of the early selling points is the ability to cook fries, wings, frozen foods and other delights with less fat than other methods like deep frying, which gets foods the crispiest. As air fryers work by circulating heated air, the trays and cooking plates have holes that can also let oil and fat drain out of meats, meaning less fat and crisper food when you finally plate things up. For most cooking situations, you will likely need to lightly spray food with vegetable oil. If you don’t, there’s the chance that things will burn or char. The oil will keep things moist on the surface, and we advise refreshing things with a dash of oil spray when you turn items during cooking.\nMost air fryers are easy to clean – especially in comparison to a shallow or deep fryer. We’ll get into cleaning guidance a little later.\nWith a smaller space to heat, air fryers are generally more energy-efficient for cooking food than larger appliances like ovens. And if you don’t have an oven, air fryers are much more affordable – especially the pod options.\nThere are, however, some drawbacks. While air fryers are easy enough to use, they take time to master. You will adjust cooking times for even the simplest types of food – like chicken nuggets, frozen French fries or brussels sprouts. If you’re the kind of person that loves to find inspiration from the internet, in our experience, you can pretty much throw their timings out of the window. There are a lot of air fryer options, and factors like how fast they heat and how well distributed that heat is can – and will – affect cooking.\nThere’s also a space limitation to air fryers. This is not a TARDIS – there’s simply less space than most traditional ovens and many deep fat fryers. If you have a bigger family, you’ll probably want to go for a large capacity air fryer – possibly one that has multiple cooking areas. You also might want to consider a different kitchen appliance, like a multicooker, sous vide or slow cooker to meet your specific cooking needs.\nYou may also struggle to cook many items through as the heat settings will cook the surface of dishes long before it’s cooked right through. If you’re planning to cook a whole chicken or a roast, please get a meat thermometer!\nBest air fryer accessories\nBeyond official accessories from the manufacturer, try to pick up silicone-tipped tools. Tongs are ideal, as is a silicon spatula to gently loosen food that might get stuck on the sides of the air fryer. These silicone mats will also help stop things from sticking to the wire racks on some air fryers. They have holes to ensure the heated air is still able to circulate around the food.\nSilicone trivets are also useful for resting any cooked food on while you sort out the rest of the meal. And if you find yourself needing oil spray, but don’t feel like repeatedly buying tiny bottles, you can decant your favorite vegetable oil into a permanent mister like this.\n\n\n\n\nHow to clean an air fryer\nWe’re keeping clean up simple here. Yes, you could use power cleaners from the grocery store, they could damage the surface of your air fryer. Likewise, metal scourers or brushes could strip away the non-stick coating. Remember to unplug the device and let it cool completely.\nRemove the trays, baskets and everything else from inside. If the manufacturer says the parts are dishwasher safe – and you have a dishwasher – the job is pretty much done.\nOtherwise, hand wash each part in a mixture of warm water, with a splash of Dawn or another strong dish soap. Use a soft-bristled brush to pull away any crumbs, greasy deposits or bits of food stuck to any surfaces. Remember to rinse everything. Otherwise, your next batch of wings could have a mild Dawn aftertaste. Trust us.\nTake a microfiber cloth and tackle the outer parts and handles that might also get a little messy after repeated uses. This is especially useful for oven-style air fryers – use the cloth to wipe down the inner sides.\nIf Dawn isn’t shifting oily stains, try mixing a small amount of baking soda with enough water to make a paste, and apply that so that it doesn’t seep into any electrical parts or the heating element. Leave it to work for a few seconds before using a damp cloth to pull any greasy spots away. Rinse out the cloth and wipe everything down again, and you should be ready for the next time you need to air fry.\nHow to find air fryer recipes\nBeyond fries, nuggets and – a revelation – frozen gyoza, there are a few ways to find recipes for air-fried foods. First, we found that the air fryer instruction manuals often have cooking guides and recipe suggestions for you to test out in your new kitchen gadget. The good thing with these is that they were made for your air fryer model, meaning success should be all but guaranteed. They are often a little unimaginative, however.\nMany of the top recipe sites and portals have no shortage of air fryer recipes, and there’s no harm in googling your favorite cuisine and adding the words “air fryer” on the end of the search string. We’ve picked up some reliable options from Delish, which also has a handy air fryer time converter for changing oven and traditional fryer recipes. BBC Good Food is also worth browsing for some simple ideas, as is NYT Cooking, with the ability to directly search for air fryer suggestions. Aside from that, you can also grab plenty of cookbooks from your local bookshop with lots of recipes that you can use in your favorite air fryer.\nAnd if you have a killer recipe or unique use for your air fryer, let us know in the comments. What’s the air fryer equivalent of the Instant Pot cheesecake? We’re ready to try it.\nHow we test air fryers\nWe put each air fryer we test through its paces by cooking a variety of foods in it including raw proteins like fish and chicken, raw vegetables like potatoes and cauliflower and frozen snacks like mozzarella sticks. We attempt to use each cooking method that the machine has pre-programmed, and when possible, follow a couple of recipes in any provided recipe booklets that come with the air fryer. We also clean the cooking basket and all other removable components as many times as possible, and will put those components into a dishwasher if they claim to be dishwasher-safe. We also make note of how loud the machine is when using different cooking settings and how warm the surrounding area becomes.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/kitchen-tech/best-air-fryers-133047180.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Robot vacuums are some of the pricier smart home gadgets you can get, making them great items to look for during sales like Amazon Prime Day. The annual shopping event always includes solid deals on electronics, and that includes smart home gear like autonomous dirt-suckers. Prime Day 2025 is no different, as it has brought deep discounts to many of our top picks for the best robot vacuums you can get today. And if you’re on the market for a cordless vacuum, those sales are abundant as well. Here are the best Prime Day vacuum deals you can get for the last day of the sale.\nBest Prime Day robot vacuum deals\n\n\nEufy 11S Max robot vacuum for $140 (50 percent off): A favorite budget robot vacuum of ours, the 11S Max has a slim profile that allows it to easily get other some furniture that other robovacs can't reach. It does a good job of sucking up dirt and debris, and even though it doesn't have Wi-Fi connectivity, it comes with a remote control that gives you most of the functions an app would have. \nShark AV2501S AI Ultra robot vacuum for $250 (55 percent off): A version of our favorite robot vacuum, this Shark machine has strong suction power and won't choke at the first sight of pet hair or big dust bunnies. Its self-emptying base is bagless as well, which means you won't have to buy propriety bags to refill it with over time. This auto-empty base has a 30-day capacity, but you can spend a bit more if you want a model with a 60-day capacity.\nShark PowerDetect NeverTouch Pro robot vacuum and mop for $700 (42 percent off): This Shark machine is one of our favorites in part because it truly lives up to its name. Thanks to its self-emptying dock that handles vacuumed debris along with clean and dirty mopping water, you really don't have to touch the thing for at least 30 days in between cleanings. We found it to be a solid autonomous dirt sucker, and its mopping capabilities are quite good to match.\nRoborock Q7 M5+ for $250 (42 percent off): This robovac has 10,000Pa suction power, LiDAR navigation, an anti-tangle brush design and Wi-Fi connectivity. It also comes with a self-cleaning base that can hold up to seven weeks of debris before it needs to be emptied.\nBest Prime Day vacuum deals\n\n\nDyson V15 Detect Plus for $570 ($180 off): You can't get much better than a Dyson if you're on the market for a cordless stick vacuum, and the V15 Detect delivers.

It also sports a single-button start and Tineco's iLoop smart sensor.\nShark PowerDetect Clean & Empty cordless vacuum for $400 (33 percent off): Shark's cordless vacuums are just as good as their robot vacuums, and you can usually find them on sale for less than other major brands. This one has great suction power and a relatively lightweight design, but the fact that it comes with a self-emptying base makes it an ultra-convenient choice.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-amazon-prime-day-robot-vacuum-deals-end-tonight-save-on-machines-from-shark-irobot-dyson-and-others-140049071.html?src=rss",

And if you’re on the market for a cordless vacuum, those sales are abundant as well.

    "summary": "If you've been holding an SSD or external HDD for your PC build in a cart, waiting to take advantage of an Amazon Prime Day discount, today is your last chance to grab your hardware at that cheaper price. Solid-state drives (SSDs) come in many shapes, from thumbnail-sized microSD cards to larger external SSDs. But all classes of SSDs have one thing in common: at least one of the best brands is on sale right now. Take a look at our curated list of the best deals on external and portable SSDs, HDDs and microSD cards.\nBest Prime Day SSD deals\n\n\n\nCrucial BX500 for $57 (40 percent off): The Crucial BX500 SSD is compatible with any computer that uses a 2.5-inch SATA drive — which is still plenty of them. For very cheap, you can get ahold of 1TB storage space and read speeds up to 540 MB/s, close to the very best possible for a SATA SSD.\nWD_BLACK SN850X for $150 (25 percent off): Our current favorite Gen4 NVMe drive is on sale for Prime Day, making a read speed of over 7,000 MB/s more accessible than ever. In our tests, we found the 1TB SN850X significantly boosted our Windows operating speeds without adding much heat.\nWD Blue SN5000 for $200 (33 percent off): Here's a great deal on an internal SSD with 4TB capacity and compatibility with the fast-performing NVMe protocol. Western Digital, the same brand behind the WD_BLACK (see above) claims the Blue model can hit read speeds of 5,500 MB/s.\nLexar 1TB NM790 for $67 (29 percent off): The NM790 is a single-sided SSD that can post sequential read speeds of 7400 MB/s. The one-sided design means it stays cooler for longer, and this 1TB deal includes a heatsink. It's a great budget alternative to the also single-sided Samsung 990 Pro (see below).\nSabrent Rocket 2230 for $150 (15 percent off): The Sabrent Rocket 2230 is a thumbnail-sized NVMe card that we found to be perfect for the M.2 slot on a Steam Deck. Thanks to this deal, you can save a lot by buying a lower-end Steam Deck and upgrading it with one of these.\nSamsung Fit Plus for $23 (34 percent off): The Fit Plus is our favorite thumb drive, and it's not close. Running on USB 3.1 with transfer speeds between 300 and 400 MB/s, it even comes with a keychain hook. The current deal takes 34 percent off an already cheap product.\nSamsung 870 EVO for $76 (24 percent off): The 870 EVO is a great budget choice for general users, who are likely to get a speed boost on any PC activity once it's installed. At 560 MB/s of maximum reading speed, it's not for hardcore gamers, but everyday users should see real benefits.\nSamsung 990 Pro for $150 (29 percent off): The whole Samsung Pro line of SSDs is excellent for gamers, with PS5s in particular seeming to run much faster with one installed. The 990 Pro can reach read speeds of up to 1,400 KB/s — and yes, that's kilobytes, not megabytes.\nSamsung 9100 Pro for $220 (31 percent off): Samsung's first NVMe SSD dropped earlier this year, and currently, they're still a bit faster than most people can use. However, if you want to get a jump on the next console generation with 14,800 MB/s sequential reading speed, this deal is your opportunity.\nKingston Fury Renegade for $420 (33 percent off): Although it sounds like a Jamaican kung fu movie we'd watch the hell out of, the Kingston Fury Renegade is actually a 5th-gen NVMe SSD that can reach hardcore read speeds of up to 14,800 MB/s. It's expensive, but Prime Day discounts knock off 33 percent.\nCorsair MP600 Pro LPX 2 TB for $160 (20 percent off): Earlier this year, we named the Corsair MP600 Pro LPX as the top SSD for PS5, partly due to its affordability. It's even more affordable now — and the low price even includes a heatsink.\nAcer FA100 1TB for $51 (15 percent off): The Acer FA100 isn't the fastest SSD, but it is at least competitive, and may be one of the cheapest ways to harness the considerable power of NVMe 3.0. Only the 1TB version is marked down for Prime Day.\n\nBest Prime Day portable SSD deals\n\nSamsung T7 for $114 (39 percent off): The T7 spent a long time as our reigning champion portable SSD, and it's still an amazing deal — being technically outdated means record-low prices on hardware that's more than fast enough for a Steam Deck or Switch.\nSamsung T9 for $170 (43 percent off): We once named the Samsung T7 as our favorite portable SSD, but the T9 handily outdoes it, nearly doubling data transfer speeds. It's marked down 43 percent from now until the end of Prime Day on the 11th.\nSanDisk 1TB Extreme for $78 (40 percent off): SanDisk designed the Extreme for portability, and it shows — this is an almost indestructible SSD you can keep in just about any bag or pocket. It's also reasonably fast, though it only works with USB-C. This 1TB deal knocks off 40 percent of the price.\nSanDisk 2TB Extreme for $120 (43 percent off): The 2TB version of the SanDisk Extreme is on sale for 43 percent off, saving you $90 on 1,050 MB/s of read speed.\nSanDisk 4TB Extreme PRO for $270 (32 percent off): This deal doubles not only the storage space of the 2TB Extreme above, but also its read and write speeds, with each hovering around 2000 MB/s. It's a very cheap way to get your hands on a USB 3.2 Gen 2x2 drive.\nCrucial X9 Pro 1TB for $75 (17 percent off): As a Gen 2 USB drive, the Crucial X9 Pro loses out to some newer competitors on speed — but it's much cheaper, and far more compatible with everyday personal computers. The 1TB model is on sale at 17 percent off its normal price.\nCrucial X9 Pro 2TB for $120 (33 percent off): The Crucial X9 Pro with 2TB storage space is marked down 33 percent for Prime Day.\nCrucial X10 1TB for $82 (24 percent off): The Crucial X10 is a portable SSD for power users, only working at full strength on devices that support the latest version of USB 3.2. If that's what your build needs, you're not likely to see it much cheaper than this.\nCrucial X10 2TB for $135 (18 percent off): A 2TB version of the X10 is almost 20 percent off right now.\nCrucial X10 Pro 2TB for $150 (28 percent off): The Crucial X10 Pro is perfect for a fairly small range of users. If your PC build currently works with USB 3.2 Gen 2x2 but isn't yet handling USB4 or Thunderbolt, you won't find a faster portable SSD for your needs.\nKingston XS1000 for $80 (15 percent off): We named the Kingston XS1000 the second-best portable SSD in our current roundup, so it's great to see it going for 15 percent off today. It's almost as fast as the Crucial X9 Pro, just not quite as tough.\nADATA SE920 for $142 (5 percent off): The piddly 5 percent off is disappointing, but there's nothing disappointing about the ADATA SE920 itself. This is the ideal model for anyone regularly making huge downloads. The SE920's maximum read speed of 3,800 MB/s would be impressive for a full-size SSD, but it's fully portable, weighing less than half a pound.\nGarmese 1TB Portable SSD for $64 (20 percent off): This portable SSD uses USB3.2 to achieve read speeds of around 1000 MB/s, which is very impressive for a device not much larger than a flash drive. While it downloads fast, it's not fantastic for transferring multiple files at a time.\n\nBest Prime Day microSD card deals\n\nLexar Professional Silver Plus for $38 (48 percent off): Our tests showed this to be the fastest microSD card on the market, beating out the whole Samsung line. Not only is it fast enough to download and upload 4K files without trying your patience, it's also waterproof, cheap and squeezes in both USB-A and USB-C ports.\nLexar E-Series for $31 (15 percent off): While the Silver Plus beats it out, the Lexar E-Series remains more than fast enough for 4K video, and is sufficiently rugged to fit in your adventure camera. This deal includes a five-pack of microSD cards, working out to about six dollars per 64GB of storage.\nSamsung Pro Plus for $17 (35 percent off): The Samsung Pro Plus is a great microSD card for most needs, so if it's cheaper than the Lexar option, go for it. We've found that it's particularly good in handheld game systems. Just make sure to get the version rated for 180 MB/s, nothing less (it should say on the package).\nSanDisk Ultra 256GB microSDXC for $17 (35 percent off): If you're still rocking the Switch 1 (thanks, Target) and want a cheap storage expander, this deal on a SanDisk 256GB microSD card is for you. It's going for $17 right now, far less than most of the games you're likely to store on it.\nSamsung Evo Select for $22 (27 percent off): This one's by far the best option if you're after a cheap microSD card — we've seen it on sale for less than $25 more than once. It's a bit too slow for cameras, but fine for any kind of undemanding passive storage.\n\nBest Prime Day external hard drive deals\n\nSeagate Portable for $65 (19 percent off): All the Seagate hard drives we've used are refreshingly good at combining thin, light hardware with consistent speeds, and the Portable is no exception. At 4TB, this is a great deal on an external HDD with no tradeoffs.\nSeagate Game Drive for $76 (16 percent off): Seagate's Game Drive is a prime choice for adding extra space to a PS5 or Xbox Series X. Formerly overpriced, it's now dropped down to $90 for 2 TB, and that's before Prime Day makes it even cheaper.\nWD My Passport for $140 (24 percent off): The Western Digital My Passport line is ancient by computer hardware standards, but it's been updated as far as USB 3.0 and 3.1, and remains one of the cheaper options for a 6 TB hard drive. This version includes automatic backup software.\nWD Elements for $130 (26 percent off): The Elements HDD from Western Digital has gotten consistently positive feedback from our staff over the years, and as an older model, it's now wildly cheap for 6 TB of storage. It's compatible with both PC and Mac out of the box.\nWD_BLACK P10 Game Drive for $155 (18 percent off): We're big fans of the WD_BLACK SSD, and the gaming-focused external P10 is a worthy companion. It comes with 6 TB of storage for your PC, PS5, or Xbox gaming library.\nUnionSine 500GB External Hard Drive for $27 (19 percent off): UnionSine's HDD is fast and USB3 compatible. Despite how thin and light it is, we've found it remarkably hard to damage. 500GB may be a bit tight with the size of files these days, but at this price, you could just buy two of them.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/amazon-prime-day-deals-on-ssds-and-external-hard-drives-for-the-last-day-save-on-samsung-crucial-sandisk-and-more-090355730.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "We've officially hit the last day of Amazon’s July Prime Day sale. But there's still time to stock up on accessories and smaller electronics. Every Prime Day tech deal we listed here is on sale for $50 and under — some deals are even all-time lows. Right now, Anker cables and chargers, the Echo Spot smart speaker, microSD cards, Roku streaming sticks, Samsung Bluetooth trackers and more are on sale. And all of them are products and brands we recommend based on Engadget’s own testing and reviews. Read on for the best Prime Day deals we could find on tech that costs less than $50.\nEngadget's top picks\nAnker Nano USB-C charger block for $12 ($8 off): Remember when tiny bricks like this all maxed out at a dinky five-watts? This tiny but mighty cube is the best cheap fast charger in our guide to fast chargers and it outputs a generous 30 watts, plus the prongs fold down to make it even more teensy. \nBlink Mini 2 security camera (two-pack) for $35 ($35 off with Prime): Our pick for the best budget security camera is now even more budget friendly. We appreciated this diminutive camera’s ease of setup and excellent integration with Alexa devices, like Echo speakers and displays. It requires a subscription for person detection and cloud storage, and the image quality wasn’t the best of the bunch. If you just need one camera, you can pick one up for $20.\nSamsung Galaxy SmartTag2 Bluetooth tracker for $16 ($14 off): If you have a Samsung phone, the company’s own Bluetooth tracker may make the most sense for you. We say as much in our guide to these finding fobs. The design is attractive and the finding network admirable, drawing on the signals of nearby Galaxy devices to pinpoint your lost keys.\nAmazon Echo Spot for $45 ($35 off with Prime): The Spot speaker was resurrected last year with a slightly different design than it first had. Now the display is a half-circle on the round face of the clock and it can show you the weather, time and song title. The speaker itself brings you all Alexa can do, like setting timers, adding stuff to your grocery lists and answering questions about the weather.\nThe best Prime Day tech deals under $25\n\n\nAmazon Smart Plug for $13 ($12 off with Prime): This plug and an Alexa Echo device makes a perfect smart home starter kit (and a number of Echos are on sale for Prime Day, too). Snap this into your outlet and Alexa should automatically detect it (if not, a few taps in the Alexa app should get things connected). Then you can use it to control any lamp, fan or other simple device you plug into it — just by asking the assistant.\nAnker Right-Angle USB-C braided charging cable (two-pack) for $10 ($6 off with Prime): This is the cable I used to turn an old iPad into a digital picture frame. The right-angle looks much neater than a straight cable, plus this one can shuttle up to 240 watts of power during charging.\nAnker iPhone Nano Power Bank with Built-in USB-C Connector for $20 ($10 off with Prime): One of these little guys could represent the difference between a dead phone and a not-dead phone. It’s the size of an oldey-timey lipstick case and delivers a partial charge to any USB-C phone. We tested it out and awarded it a spot in our guide to power banks. The current discount only applies to the black colorway, and this is a few dollars higher than the all-time low of $16 it hit for Black Friday.\nJLab Go Sport+ workout earbuds for $19 ($11 off): Anyone looking for a cheap set of beater earbuds for the gym should check this out. It’s a recommendation in our guide to the best budget wireless earbuds and offers a solid eight-to-nine hours of battery life, passable (if somewhat compressed) sound and a water-resistant, around-the-ear design.\nAmazon Echo Buds for $20 (60 percent off with Prime): In our guide to the best budget earbuds, we called Amazon’s latest earbuds the best option for an open-ear design. That means they don’t go all the way in your ear canal, which is far more comfortable for some people. They’re sturdy, comfortable and the sound is decent once you’ve fiddled with the EQ settings to bring down the treble. This matches a previous low price — but is a bit more than a temporary Lightning deal for $15 that hit early on Tuesday.\nTP-Link Kasa Smart Bulbs for (four pack) for $22 (31 percent off with Prime): After testing a bunch of bulbs we deemed these the best value. Installation is easy, even for those new to smart devices, thanks to Kasa’s clean and simple app. Just note that voice control is only available with Alexa or the Google Assistant; Siri is unfortunately incompatible with these.\nAnker USB-C Cable 240W Bio-Braided for $13 ($6 off with Prime): We recommend this in our guide to iPhone accessories. It’s a reliable cable that’s durable and capable of fast charging (provided you have the right wall adapters). This matches its price in past sales.\nKasa TP-Link Smart Wi-FI outdoor plug for $17 ($8 off with Prime): We tested this one for our buying guide to smart plugs and named it the best outdoor pick for HomeKit users — but it’ll work with Alexa and the Google Assistant too. The range was decent and setup was easy, like most TP-Link plugs. Grab this now and have automatic control of your holiday lights.\nBlink Mini 2 security camera for $20 ($20 off with Prime): If you only want one Blink security camera, snag this deal. But if you can spring for a two-pack at $35, it's actually a better deal. Either way, it's our pick for the best budget security camera. Just note it requires a subscription for person detection and cloud storage, and the image quality wasn’t the best of the bunch. \nAmazon Fire TV Stick HD for $18 ($17 off with Prime): We name this the best budget streaming stick on our list of the best streaming devices. It's easy to set up and so you can access all of the major streaming platforms. Just note that it only streams content at 1080p, not 4K and the UI is more ad-heavy than competing streamers.\nApple AirTag for $20 ($9 off): Here’s our pick for a Bluetooth tracker for iPhone users. These little discs have the most accurate finding ability of any fob we tested, thanks to Apple’s vast Find My network that taps into all nearby iPhones to track down your missing stuff. They could be louder and hole would be nice, but nothing beats its accuracy. Just note that you'll get a cheaper per-tag price if you buy a four-pack. \nSamsung Fit Plus 56GB flash drive for $23 ($12 off): We named this the best thumbstick drive in our guide to the best SSDs. It has a sleek design, five-year warranty and has a USB 3.1 connection. There’s even a small attachment point for a keychain so you can take your extra storage drive with you when you go.\nJ-Tech Digital Ergonomic Mouse for $16 ($10 off with Prime and on-page coupon): The lowest price we’ve seen for one of our favorite ergonomic mice is $17 and now it’s even cheaper. This is the budget pick in our ergonomic mouse guide thanks to its vertical format, programmable buttons and nifty RBC lights (which you can turn off).\nThermacell E55 Rechargeable Repeller for $18 ($17 off with Prime): The mosquitos aren’t going anywhere. Even places that didn’t used to have these evil bloodsuckers are now overrun. If you would like some reprieve from the bites, this is the repeller we recommend in our guide to outdoor tech.\nTP-Link AC1200 WiFi extender for $20 ($10 off): If you’ve got some dead spots in your home’s internet coverage and aren’t quite ready for a mesh setup, a Wi-Fi extender can help. This is our favorite budget option in our guide to these plug-in devices thanks to its easy setup and user-friendly app.\nAmazon Echo Pop for $22 ($18 off with Prime): The smallest (and cheapest) Echo speaker is ideal for small apartments or rooms. The half-sphere design comes in purple and teal in addition to the standard black and white colorways. It's gone as low as $18 in past Prime Day sales. \nSoundcore Select 4 Go Bluetooth speaker for $19 ($16 off with Prime): One of the newest additions to our guide to the best Bluetooth speakers is this ‘lil guy from Soundcore (Anker). We found it had decent sound quality and was loud enough to fill a standard-sized living room. It's gone as low at $20 in the past.\nChipolo POP Bluetooth tracker for $25 ($4 off): The top pick in our guide to the best Bluetooth trackers was finally knocked off its throne — by another tracker from the same brand. This is our current recommendation for most people. It taps into either Apple’s Find My or Google’s Find My Device network (but just one at a time) and has a loud ring, quick Bluetooth connection and comes in fun colors.\nRoku Streaming Stick HD for $20 ($10 off): Roku just released two new streaming sticks this year. This standard model and the Plus model that supports 4K resolution. We recommend the latter in our guide to streaming sticks as the best way to catch free and live content, but if you don't have a 4K TV (or don't care about the resolution) you can grab this stick for 33 percent off. The Plus model is also on sale. \nThe best Prime Day tech deals under $35\n\n\nTP-Link Kasa Smart Plug Mini EP25 (4-pack) for $30 ($14 off with Prime): This is our favorite smart plug overall because it works with all four major smart home assistants (Alexa, Siri, Google Assistant and Samsung’s Bixby). In our tests, it connected easily and reliably controlled our lamps and other simple appliances.\nStar Wars Outlaws (Amazon Exclusive, PS5) for $29 ($31 off): At full price, this game was easy to skip. But now that it's available for just half price, it's a lot more compelling for Star Wars fans. The limited edition includes pre-order rewards like the Kessel Run bonus pack and the Rogue Infiltrator bundle.\n-> For more Prime Day gaming deals, check out our guide.\nRoku Streaming Stick Plus for $30 ($10 off): Roku replaced the Streaming Stick 4K with this model (which also supports 4K) earlier this year. We think it’s the best streaming stick for people who want to access free and live content on their TV. Roku’s interface is easy to use, colorful and lets you watch thousands of hours of free stuff, through Roku’s own content and more. You also get decently organized access to your paid content.\nAnker USB C Charger (Nano 65W) for $26 ($14 off with Prime): This is a similar model to the travel pick in our fast charger guide. It has three ports, two USB-C that deliver up to 65 watts each and a USB-A that can output 22 watts. That should refill your laptop, tablet and maybe some earbuds while not taking up too much space.\nAmazon Echo Dot Kids with Alexa for $32 ($28 off with Prime): The kids version of Amazon's smart speaker is the same hardware but with a kid-themed cover (owl or dragon) and it comes with a free year-long subscription to Amazon Kids+ with audiobooks, games and educational Alexa skills. The standard Echo Dot is on sale too, but we're disappointed in the sale price.  \nBlink Video Doorbell for $30 ($30 off with Prime): If you already use Alexa in your home and want a compatible video doorbell, you may want to check out this deal. Note that you’ll need a Blink subscription and a Blink Sync Module to store clips and to access other features. You can wire it to your existing doorbell wires or use it wirelessly with two AA batteries that can last up to two years.\nMoft Magnetic Phone Tripod for $32 ($8 off with Prime): I was impressed with how sturdily this small tripod held my phone. It folds down super thin but pops up to hold the phone in landscape or portrait orientation. The only downside is you’ll need to pop it off to wirelessly recharge (obviously) but removal and reattachment is quick.\nEarFun Free 2S wireless earbuds for $28 (30 percent off with Prime): These are fairly comfortable, have a good waterproof rating and deliver a decent amount of bass. They’re not going to deliver the fullest or most nuanced sound as more expensive buds, but for far less than $50, they’re a fine knockaround pair.\nAnker Soundcore 2 for $28 (38 percent off): The Soundcore 2 is an older bluetooth speaker, but it holds up — fully waterproof, with 24 hours of battery life and bass you can hear on the other side of a pool. It's on sale for less than $30. \n-> If you're looking for more speaker deals, check out our Prime Day speaker guide. \nThe best Prime Day tech deals under $50\n\n\nUGreen Revodok Pro 109 USB-C Hub for $32 ($22 off): The top pick in our guide to the best USB-C hubs has a good array of ports, including an HDMI 2.0 connection that supports 4K monitors at 60Hz, plus three USB-A ports, Ethernet and one USB-C (plus another for delivering 90W of power to your device. The hub has gone as low as $30 in prior sales.\nAnker 555 USB-C Hub (8-in-1) for $36 ($6 off with Prime): If you get a MacBook Air for Prime Day, you might find yourself needing more ports than the ultraportable offers. This is our favorite hub in our guide to MacBook accessories.  \nRazer Basilisk V3 gaming mouse for $36 ($34 off with Prime): Some prefer a wired connection when playing games. Razer’s Basilisk V3 is our top budget pick for a wired mouse in our gaming mouse guide. It’s comfortable, well-built, accurate and a good value — particularly with a Prime Day discount.\nHyperX Cloud Stinger 2 gaming headset for $37 ($14 off): In our guide to gaming headsets, we ultimately recommend getting an external mic along with a good pair of wired headphones for chatting. But if you really want a two-in-one, the Cloud Stinger 2 is our pick for a budget gaming headset.\nLexar Professional Silver Plus (512GB) for $38 ($35 off): We found this microSD card to be the best value of all the cards we tested. It consistently delivered faster sequential reads and writes than other models. If you need storage for your gaming handhels, camera, drone or other devices, may as well stock up now. \nLeebin Electric Spin Scrubber for $38 (46 percent off with Prime): This was Deputy Editor Valentina Palladino's favorite thing she bought last year because it makes the must-detested chore of cleaning her shower less of a pain. It's an electric spin scrubber that comes with multiple cleaning heads so you can use it on your countertops, sinks, tubs and showers and more. It also has an adjustable arm so you can reach tough spots in hard-to-reach places, and it convenient recharges via USB-C.\nAmazfit Band 7 fitness tracker for $38 ($12 off with Prime): The runner up in our guide to the best, cheap fitness trackers has a comfortable design we found easy to sleep with and a great, mutli-week battery life. The screen isn’t as bright and it wasn’t quite as speedy as our top pick, but it does let you easily set custom goals.\nHamilton Beach Digital Programmable Rice Cooker for $40 ($10 off with Prime): Our top pick for a budget rice cooker is on sale for Prime members. The brown rice came out particularly good in our tests and the cooker is easy to clean with a dishwasher-safe cooker pot and steamer basket. Just note that it’s pretty small and doesn’t have the granular controls of pricer models.\n-> See more kitchen tech Prime day deals in our guide.\nRing Pan-Tilt Indoor Cam for $40 ($40 off with Prime): This indoor security camera can spin 360 degrees and has a tilt range of 169 degrees so you can keep tabs on pets and other happenings at home. It'll let you drop in for a live view from your phone, and supports two-way talk for telling your pup to get off the couch.\nAmazon Echo Buds with Active Noise Cancellation for $45 ($95 off with Prime): These buds are a bit old at this point, as they came out in 2021, but the 68 percent discount could be compelling. In our review, we said the buds were much improved over the last generation. They're more comfortable and have a better sound quality. Plus the Alexa integration makes them a decent pick for those who've gone all-in on Amazon's ecosystem.\nMoft Folding Sit-Stand Laptop Stand for $48 ($12 off with Prime): I take this with me when I have to work somewhere away from my standing desk. It holds a 16-inch MacBook Pro 10 inches off a desk, which is just enough for you to stand up and work. It also configures into four other positions for better ergonomics as you sit. It’s one of our favorite MacBook accessories.\nAnker’s PowerConf C200 2K Webcam for $48 ($12 off with Prime): This deal matches the low from last Black Friday. It's the budget pick in our guide to the best webcams. If you want to bump up the look of your video calls, we think this will do the trick.\nExpired deals\nBlink Outdoor 4 for $45 ($55 off): We named this outdoor camera the best for Alexa homes in our security cameras guide. It can go just about anywhere you want as the wireless design runs on AA batteries and can last for two years before needing to be replaced. The motion alerts are accurate, but keep in mind you’ll need a subscription to enable person detection and cloud storage.\nJBL Go 3 for $28 (30 percent off): The JBL Go 4 gets a shout out in our guide to Bluetooth speakers, this is its predecessor. It's got a carabiner-friendly design, five hours of battery life, and IP67-rated waterproofing and dustproofing. It's not exactly powerful, but it's way better than a phone speaker for driving, trekking or camping.\nAmazon Echo Buds for $15 (70 percent off with Prime): In our guide to the best budget earbuds, we called Amazon’s latest earbuds the best option for an open-ear design. That means they don’t go all the way in your ear canal, which is far more comfortable for some people. They’re sturdy, comfortable and the sound is decent once you’ve fiddled with the EQ settings to bring down the treble. This is a lightning deal and the lowest price we've seen yet.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-amazon-prime-day-deals-under-50-that-you-can-get-before-the-event-is-over-160028359.html?src=rss",
    "full_text": "Every Prime Day tech deal we listed here is on sale for $50 and under — some deals are even all-time lows. The right-angle looks much neater than a straight cable, plus this one can shuttle up to 240 watts of power during charging. It’s the size of an oldey-timey lipstick case and delivers a partial charge to any USB-C phone. That means they don’t go all the way in your ear canal, which is far more comfortable for some people. Just note that it only streams content at 1080p, not 4K and the UI is more ad-heavy than competing streamers. This is the budget pick in our ergonomic mouse guide thanks to its vertical format, programmable buttons and nifty RBC lights (which you can turn off). We think it’s the best streaming stick for people who want to access free and live content on their TV. Plus the Alexa integration makes them a decent pick for those who've gone all-in on Amazon's ecosystem. The motion alerts are accurate, but keep in mind you’ll need a subscription to enable person detection and cloud storage. That means they don’t go all the way in your ear canal, which is far more comfortable for some people."

    "summary": "Prime Day will soon come to a close, and when it does, you’ve missed your chance at some of the best headphone and earbud deals of the year. There are still great options available from a lot of big names, and since we’ve reviewed nearly the entire list, we know what the best choices are during Amazon’s annual sale days. So, put our expertise to good use before it’s too late and let us guide you through the best Prime Day deals on still left to get on headphones and earbuds. Time is short, so don’t waste it trying to figure out meaningful features on your own.\n\nPrime Day Sony deals\n\n\nSony WH-1000XM6 headphones for $428 ($22 off): Sony's latest flagship headphones have only been out a few months and we're already seeing a small discount on them. These are my top pick in our headphones guide for the combination of advanced features, comfy fit, great sound and improved active noise cancellation (ANC).  \nSony ULT Wear headphones for $128 ($72 off): If you're after a solid set of Sony cans but don't want to splurge for the 1000X line, the ULT Wear is a good option. There are a bunch of handy features and robust sound with ULT bass boost.\nSony WH-CH720N headphones for $78 ($72 off): The cheapest Sony headphones we'd recommend for Prime Day are no slouch. They're lightweight and comfy with respectable sound for the price. You also get Adaptive Sound Control, 360 Reality Audio and multipoint Bluetooth on this budget model. \nSony WF-1000XM5 earbuds for $198 ($102 off): My top pick for best earbuds is also on sale for Prime Day. No other company comes close to the list of features Sony offers here, and that's on top of excellent sound, improved fit and effective ANC. \nSony LinkBud Fit earbuds for $128 ($72 off): Sony's much smaller earbuds offer big sound and a lot of features for less than the 1000X model. These are a big improvement over the company's LinkBuds S, which were already a low-key hit for affordable earbuds.\nSony WF-CH710N earbuds for $78 ($42 off): The CH710N is still quite new, but the earbuds are a steal at $80 for Prime Day. The compact, comfy design is a highlight, as are all the features Sony managed to pack in. Plus, they're available in a lovely transparent blue that allows you to see all of the internal components. \nSonos Prime Day deals\n\n\nPrime Day Bose deals (also available at Bose.com)\n\n\nBose QuietComfort Earbuds for $129 (28 percent off): The best Bose earbuds for most people are getting a decent discount this week. This model gives you the company's powerful ANC and great sound for less than flagship prices. You also get spatial audio and dependable battery life in this affordable option.\nBose Ultra Open Earbuds for $199 (33 percent off): If you thought Bose's clip-on open earbuds were a bit too pricey to splurge on, now's your chance to get them for less. And two colors are available at an even bigger discount than the rest, putting this set just under $200. Plus, this model works with the company's soundbars for an enhanced living room listening experience. \nBeats Prime Day deals\n\n\nBeats Solo 4 headphones for $98 (50 percent off): Beats' popular on-ear headphones are half off for Prime Day, which makes them a great deal for fans of that wear style. While they may look similar to their predecessor, the Solo 4 have improved sound and longer battery life compared to that older model.\nBeats Powerbeats Pro 2 earbuds for $180 (28 percent off): Apple's first earbuds with heart rate tracking are slightly discounted for Prime Day. This your chance to try the tech without paying full price. What's more, the Powerbeats Pro 2 have an improved design, the smarts of Apple's H2 chip and powerful bass. \nPrime Day Samsung deals\n\n\nSamsung Galaxy Buds FE for $52 (48 percent off): Samsung's budget earbuds are solid option if you're looking to spend less than $60. Like the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro, these are best-suited for Samsung devices where you'll find features like live translation and automatic switching.\nApple and Google Prime Day deals\n\n\nApple AirPods 4 for $89 (31 percent off): The redesigned \"regular\" AirPods that debuted last year are currently available well below their normal $129 price tag. Here, you'll get the new, more comfortable shape as well as updated features. \nApple AirPods 4 with ANC for $119 (34 percent off): And if you need some ANC to go with your AirPods, but don't want to go for the Pro 2, here's your best bet. These retain the open-style fit of regular AirPods but add surprisingly effective ANC to the mix. \nApple AirPods Max (USB-C) for $430 (22 percent off): Apple's over-ear headphones are $119 off during Prime Day, which softens the blow to your wallet for this pricey set. They're comfy and offer a lot of handy features for Apple devices. Plus, you can unlock lossless listening with a wired connection. \nGoogle Pixel Buds Pro 2 for $160 (30 percent off): The best earbuds for Pixel phone users are down to $160, which makes them a great purchase right now. Live translate and hands-free access to Gemini might be the highlight, but these earbuds have great sound and capable ANC too. \nPrime Day deals on Dyson\nDyson OnTrac headphones for $300 (40 percent off): This set isn't without its flaws, but I can understand why you'd be drawn to the almost infinitely customizable design and long battery life. There's also real-time hearing health features and the sound is crisp and clear even though it lacks depth and immersion. \nJBL Prime Day deals\nJBL Tour One M2 headphones for $150 (50 percent off): The biggest discount on JBL headphones or earbuds comes on the flagship over-hear Tour One M2. These ANC headphones have Smart Ambient sound, Smart Talk automatic pausing and other advanced features. \nJBL Live Beam 3 for $150 (25 percent off): If you're looking for a discounted way to get your hands on JBL's touchscreen earbud case, the Live Beam 3 is your chance. In addition to the fancy case, you'll get up to 12 hours of use on a charge, adaptive ANC and high-res audio compatibility. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/prime-day-2025-the-best-headphone-and-earbud-deals-from-sony-beats-bose-and-more-for-the-last-day-of-the-sale-082347142.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "The last day of Amazon’s sale has arrived. Throughout the sale, we've been updating this with the best Apple Prime Day deals we could find. Since last July, Apple has released around a dozen new products, including the AirPods 4, the Apple Watch Series 10, an M4 MacBook Air and a new iPad mini and iPad Air. Every one of those devices is currently on sale — some at the lowest prices we've ever seen. Of course, new Apple gear is inevitable, with M5 chips, possibly some new AirTags, a rumored home hub, and of course, the iPhone 17 all on the horizon. But one thing we love about Apple products is the longevity, so whatever you buy today should serve you well for a good long while. \nBest Prime Day iPad deals\n\n\nApple iPad (A16) for $280 ($69 off): The latest edition of Apple’s standard iPad isn’t powerful enough to run Apple Intelligence, but we don’t think that’s an issue. In his review, Enadget’s Jeff Dunn praised the tablet’s speed, calling it “plenty fast” for browsing the web, streaming video, editing photos and playing most games. It’s the most affordable iPad (especially now) and it easily handles the basics. This is a new all-time low price.  \nApple iPad Air (11-inch, M3) for $479 ($120 off): In our opinion, the iPad Air is the best iPad for most people as it strikes an ideal balance between performance, price and features. The M3 chip is almost overkill for a tablet, but it means performance should never be an issue. And upcoming productivity gains from iPadOS 26 should make the tablet even more powerful. This is the lowest price we've seen so far for this model, and it's still in stock. \nApple iPad Mini (A17 Pro) for $379 ($120 off): Apple’s smallest iPad earned an 83 review score from us when it came out late last year. Despite its compact size, it’s still a fully-featured iPad, with support for accessories and a laminated, anti-reflective screen. It’s not a laptop-replacer, but rather the perfect couch companion, handling games, video, web browsing and email triage. This deal is the cheapest the mini has ever been.  \nApple iPad Air (13-inch, M3) for $679 ($120 off): This is Apple’s most affordable large-screen iPad. Engadget’s Nate Ingraham awarded it a review score of 89 upon its debut this March. When you pair it with accessories like a keyboard folio and mouse, it becomes a true productivity machine — though those add-ons make it a pricey package. Good thing iPads are on sale for Prime Day. This $120 discount matches the lowest price we've seen over the past couple months.  \nApple iPad Pro (11-inch, M4) for $899 ($100 off): We named the iPad Pro the best tablet money can buy. The screen is one of the best we’ve seen and Apple somehow managed to make the Pro model lighter than Air models. If you plan on handling heavy productivity — video rendering and editing, machine learning apps and the like, this is the way to go.\nBest Prime Day AirPod deals\n\n\nAirPods Max (USB-C) for $430 ($119 off): Apple’s only over-ear headphones are due for an update. The company outfitted the AirPods Max with a USB-C port late last year, but the internals haven’t had an overhaul since 2020. Still, we named them the best (and only) over-ear AirPods. They are comfortable and relatively lightweight, have a balanced sound and the noise cancellation is solid. The headphones dipped down to $399 (in starlight) on Tuesday, but have now popped back up to $430.\nAirPods 4 (with ANC) for $119 ($60 off): Apple introduced the fourth generation of its basic earbuds alongside the iPhone 16 last September. This model includes ANC — a first for Apple’s “regular” buds — and Billy awarded them an 86 in his review. Just note they don’t have a fully closed design like the Pro models — but some may prefer the open fit, which Apple completely redesigned to fit more securely.\nAirPods 4 (without ANC) for $89 ($40 off): Apple introduced two models of its fourth generation basic earbuds alongside the iPhone 16 last September. This one doesn't have the extra features of ANC or Transparency Mode (which makes them cheaper). This pared down model benefits from a shape redesign — which our headphone expert, Billy Steele, found both more comfortable and more secure — as well as improved sound quality that’s more immersive than before.\nBest Prime Day MacBook deals\n\n\nMacBook Air (M4, 13-inch) for $849 ($150 off): Engadget’s Devindra Hardawar named the M4 MacBook Air the best laptop overall. It’s remarkably thin and light, with an excellent battery life, and the M4 chip is powerful, making this an ideal ultraportable productivity machine. Apple reduced the starting price by $100 compared to the last MacBook Air, and this deal only makes it an even better buy.\nMacBook Air (M4, 15-inch) for $1,049 ($150 off): If you want a little more screen real estate, go for the 15-inch Air. Devindra found the screen more immersive than the smaller model, and only slightly less portable. The slightly larger battery gave it a few more minutes of life. Whichever size you go for, the MacBook Air will be able to handle all but the most demanding rendering tasks without breaking a sweat.\nMacBook Air (15-inch, M3, 24GB RAM) for $1,249 ($450 off with coupon): This higher-specced version of the M3 MacBook Air from last year has a 15-inch screen and a little extra internal memory. We gave the 15-inch model a score of 90 in our review when it came out in early 2024. Outside of its older M3 chip (which is still plenty fast for everyday use), marginally improved camera and inability to power two external displays with the lid open, this MacBook is virtually identical to the M4 version. Note this discount applies to the Starlight colorway and you'll need to click the on-page coupon to get the full deal. \nWe found a few non-Apple laptops on sale for Prime Day, too.  \nBest Prime Day Apple Watch deals\n\n\nApple Watch Series 10 for $279 ($120 off): Apple only announced one new smartwatch last September and this is it. It’s a little wider than the Series 9, but thanks to a slimmer design, it doesn’t feel clunky. The health and fitness tracking is still better than most smartwatches out there and the integration with an iPhone is seamless. There’s a reason it’s our favorite smartwatch overall. This is the lowest price we've ever tracked on the wearable, though throughout the day, Amazon has been oscillating between limiting the deal to Prime members and opening the price to anyone.  \nApple Watch SE for $169 (32 percent off): We wouldn’t be surprised to see an update to Apple’s budget smartwatch sometime soon (and we have a few suggestions on the matter). But thanks to some serious discounts, the Apple Watch SE has turned out to be the most affordable way to get an iPhone companion for your wrist. Despite the lackluster screen and limited extra features, it handles the basics well.\nApple Watch Ultra 2 for $650 ($149 off with Prime): The second generation of Apple’s premium smartwatch came out in 2023 along with the iPhone 15 (last September it just got a new Titanium Black colorway. The Ultra model is geared towards serious athletes and outdoor adventurers, packing specialized features like a 40-meter depth gauge, dual-frequency GPS and an on-board siren.\nBest Prime Day deals on Apple accessories\n\n\nApple Pencil (USB-C) for $59 ($20 off): Before you buy an Apple Pencil, check this compatibility page to make sure it’ll work with your model and generation of iPad. To say the least, it’s confusing. This model has the widest compatibility, but note that it doesn’t charge through its magnetic attachment, you’ll need to use the USB-C for refilling it.  \nApple Pencil Pro for $99 ($30 off): Apple announced the Pro version of its pencil at the same time as the iPad Pro with the M4 chip. It adds haptic feedback, squeeze gestures and roll capabilities to the usual stylus tricks. It works with the newest iPad Pro, Air and Mini models.\nApple Pencil (2nd gen) for $90 ($39 off): The Second gen Pencil both attaches and charges magnetically, supports tilt and pressure sensitivity and allows for tool changes with a tap of the flat edge. It’s an older pencil and isn’t compatible with the latest iPad models. This is the lowest price we’ve tracked this year, but it went as low as $80 for last year’s Black Friday sales.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-prime-day-apple-deals-on-airpods-ipads-macbooks-and-more-for-the-last-day-of-the-sale-150005300.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "If you're ready to upgrade how you listen to music and experience TV, the July Amazon Prime Day sale is almost certain to be your best chance this year — but today's the final day. Amazon is knocking chunks off the prices of premium Sonos soundbars, bluetooth speakers from JBL and Soundcore, its own Echo smart speakers and more of the best audio hardware. The deals below are drawn from our curated lists of the best smart speakers, best soundbars and best portable bluetooth speakers. We recommend taking a look now, as it's not likely any of these products will be so cheap again until at least Ocrober.\nBest Prime Day Bluetooth speaker deals\nOur portable bluetooth speaker picks are some of the best all-around mobile music devices to ever hit the shelves: smaller and lighter than a boombox, better audio than an iPod, and way easier in the long run than learning to play guitar. We've sifted through Prime Day offerings to find the best portable speakers in all shapes and sizes. \n\n\n\nBeats Pill for $99 (34 percent off): The Beats Pill is one of the few portable bluetooth speakers we liked enough to give it a full review. Those of you who love the classic Beats bluetooth speakers will be happy to know they're back in fine form. Nobody can beat the Pill for bass, and its sound is crisp and lossless at almost any frequency and volume. For some reason, only the Kim Kardashian branded version is on sale, but it's the exact same speaker.\nSoundcore Motion 300 for $53 (34 percent off): The Motion 300 is that rare portable speaker that outperforms at both high and low frequencies. Its upper range goes into 40 kHz, while its bass can deliver bone-shaking thumps even outdoors. All that in 1.7 pounds with 13 hours of battery life — and it's even partially waterproof.\nAnker Soundcore Motion+ for $75 (24 percent off): Tough, sturdy construction makes this speaker an excellent choice for home bluetooth. Its battery lasts for 12 hours in the wild, and it always sounds great, but it's a bit heavy for pedaling through the park. There's also an option for wired connections, and it even works as a backup soundbar.\nAnker Soundcore 2 for $28 (38 percent off): The Soundcore 2 is an older bluetooth speaker, but it holds up — fully waterproof, with 24 hours of battery life and bass you can hear on the other side of a pool. It's on sale for less than $30.\nSoundcore Select 4 for $19 (46 percent off): This 9.3-ounce speaker is a massive improvement over built-in smartphone audio. It can fill a room at a decent range of frequencies, and works well in room-sized outdoor spaces — plus, with IP67 waterproofing, it can survive a dip in the pool. It's currently almost half off.\nUE Everboom for $190 (30 percent off): If you want something stronger than the Wonderboom but the Hyperboom isn't portable enough, the Everboom is a great middle ground. Its ideal range is a little narrow, but it makes up for that with 360-degree sound and extreme durability (i.e. so waterproof it literally floats).\nJBL Pulse 5 for $197 (21 percent off): The Pulse 5 is JBL's latest and greatest party speaker, throwing out 360-degree light bursts that sync up to the music. There's substance behind the flash, too, with speakers designed around the bass frequencies and 12 hours of battery life.\nBose SoundLink Flex 2nd Gen for $99 (34 percent off): This mini speaker from Bose is one of our favorites on the list for hands-free phone calls. It supports both Google Assistant and Siri and runs up to 12 hours on one charge, all while being smaller than a clutch purse. It also kills as a portable music player, though the sound doesn't stretch far enough to fill a room.\nBose Soundlink Revolve+ Series II for $179 (40 percent off): The Revolve series was Bose's first line of 360-degree outdoor speakers, and they're still a strong choice today. The Revolve+ weighs about two pounds and can run for 17 hours without recharging.\nBose Soundlink Max for $299 (25 percent off): Bose's Soundlink Max marries a classic carrying-case design with audio that sounds like it's coming from a much bigger unit. It comes with a 20-hour battery and IP67-rated protection against the elements.\nMarshall Emberton II for $95 (47 percent off): Marshall has been making audio equipment for more than 60 years, and still has a thing or two to teach the young'ns. The Emberton II looks like a classic amp, but weighs a quarter of a pound and provides balanced sound for more than 30 hours per charge.\nMarshall Acton III for $200 (33 percent off): All right, so a six-pound speaker isn't exactly portable — but if you can stand lugging it around, the Acton III can be a highly versatile device. From music to outdoor parties to pulling double duty as a soundbar, this is a low-setup, low-overhead option for nearly all audio tasks.\nOrtizan X10 for $30 (41 percent off): Ortizan is a newer brand from China, but we like what we've seen from them so far. The X10 is the size of the Beats Pill but comes at the price of a belt-clip speaker like the JBL Go 3. If you do have a problem, Ortizan's customer service is highly responsive.\n\nBest Prime Day smart speaker deals\nSmart speakers aren't just about getting a disembodied voice to do your bidding (or at least as much of your bidding as Alexa can do without hands). On top of assistant support, the picks below serve up legitimately great audio quality alongside useful extra features. The only downside is that they're often overpriced, but that's what Prime Day is for.\n\nAmazon Echo Dot for $32 (36 percent off): Amazon may not have updated the Echo Dot since 2022, but that just goes to show how well this spherical smart speaker serves as the perfect host for Alexa. Both music and speech sound clear, and it's easy to integrate with other smart home devices. Right now, it's marked down more than a third.\nAmazon Echo Pop for $22 (45 percent off): The latest Echo Pop release continues the trend of making Alexa's best features available on a mini-sized, reasonably priced device. Its half-spherical design fits on any desk or shelf, and its sound output is consistently clear — and gets louder than you might believe.\nSonos Era 100 for $179 (10 percent off): Smart speakers from the Amazon Echo line play perfectly good music, but true audiophiles in need of assistant support should look to Sonos. The Era 100 has tweeters and woofers precisely arranged for clear, full-room sound, and it's easy to hook up to your other audio gear. Just be warned it only supports Alexa, not Google Assistant.\nJBL Authentics 200 for $200 (47 percent off): JBL's Authentics line is modeled after a product it sold in the 70s. Its old-school bookshelf-friendly design belies its advanced feat of running Google Assistant and Alexa simultaneously (as opposed to other smart speakers where you have to pick just one).\nJBL Authentics 300 for $285 (37 percent off): The JBL Authentics 300 can host both Alexa and Google Assistant at the same time, which impressed us enough that we gave it a full review. While we had some issues — namely its tendency to over-emphasize vocals — we can't quibble with its high-range performance or retro design.\n\nBest Prime Day soundbar deals\nFlatter, lighter and larger TV screens are nice for visuals, but often sacrifice sound quality to lose weight. If you've found yourself turning on the subtitles for your shows more often lately, you might need a soundbar to augment your TV's built-in speakers. We found a few of the best on sale for Prime Day — Sonos leads this space, but it's not without competitors.\n\nBose Smart for $400 (20 percent off): In our full review of the Bose Smart, we noted that two drivers in the center make its sound feel directional without any other speakers needed — simply cranking up those makes any audio more immersive. You can also link it to a pair of Ultra Open Earbuds (not included) for a private surround sound experience.\nBose Smart Ultra for $700 (22 percent off): The Smart Ultra upgrades the Bose Smart with a more sophisticated calibration system which adjusts sound settings to fill whatever room it's in. If you want the Smart's personal surround experience for more than one person, the Smart Ultra is for you.\nSonos Beam for $369 (26 percent off): The Sonos Beam is a fantastic choice for a mid-budget soundbar. It's one of the most accessible Dolby Atmos systems, and uses careful audio alterations to achieve a much more immersive sound than other bars of its size.\nSonos Ray for $169 (15 percent off): If you're looking to pay a bit less, go with the Sonos Ray to maximize sound quality on a budget. The audio won't wrap around your room like it might from a more premium model, but it's still a vast improvement on nearly all built-in TV speakers.\nAmazon Fire TV Plus for $150 (40 percent off): Amazon's latest Fire TV soundbar is built for streaming TV and emphasizing dialogue. If you have any other Amazon TVs or streaming devices, you'll find it easy to integrate with your existing hardware — you can even use the same remote to control them all.\nSony HT-S400 for $178 (41 percent off): Sony built the HT-S400 for everyone who wants a soundbar but not an entire home theater. It's a 2.1-channel system that still manages immersive surround sound and is easy to integrate with Sony TVs. Right now, it's 40 percent off, one of the best prices we've seen on any soundbar.\nSony Bravia Theater Bar 6 for $448 (31 percent off): One of Sony's newest audio products, the Bravia Theater Bar 6 is a 3.1.2 soundbar that can bend audio in more directions to fill your theater space. It can handle Dolby Atmos, and has an integrated AI feature that recognizes and clarifies human voices.\nVIZIO 2.0 for $78 (22 percent off): Vizio's budget soundbar makes a worthy alternative to the Sonos Ray. It punches above its weight and gets as close as possible to Dolby Atmos surround sound as a single unit can manage. For less than $100, you'll never mishear a line of dialogue again.\nJBL Bar 9.1 for $760 (37 percent off): The 9.1 is JBL's first sound bar to be compatible with Dolby Atmos, and it doesn't disappoint. Each unit comes with two wireless speakers you can move around your viewing room, and there's even a 4K passthrough input to ensure your sound system doesn't mess with image quality.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-prime-day-speaker-deals-last-chance-to-get-up-to-47-percent-off-on-jbl-bose-sonos-and-others-085948445.html?src=rss",
    "full_text": "Amazon is knocking chunks off the prices of premium Sonos soundbars, bluetooth speakers from JBL and Soundcore, its own Echo smart speakers and more of the best audio hardware. We recommend taking a look now, as it's not likely any of these products will be so cheap again until at least Ocrober. We've sifted through Prime Day offerings to find the best portable speakers in all shapes and sizes. Smart speakers aren't just about getting a disembodied voice to do your bidding (or at least as much of your bidding as Alexa can do without hands).

Anker makes some of our favorite charging gear and I always end up picking up an accessory or two during Prime Day to ensure I have what I need when I need it most, and I feel better knowing I didn't spend full price on it.\nLast year, for example, I picked up a couple of extra USB-C charging cables so I could keep one in my carry-on luggage so I always have one when I travel. Also, every year it seems I need yet another surge protector, so even though I picked one up last year, I'll probably do the same this year, too.

    "summary": "Amazon Prime Day is always a great time to consider a TV upgrade (aside from Black Friday, of course). While the prices for big screen TVs have fallen quite a bit over the years, even for coveted tech like OLED, there’s always room for additional discounts. For the last day of July Prime Day, we’re seeing prices slashed on Samsung, Sony and LG sets, in addition to several other manufacturers. And as usual, we’ve also collected a few solid deals on streaming devices and soundbars to upgrade your setup even more. Who needs to shell out for the cinema when you can get an enormous screen and bombastic sound at a huge discount?\nBest Prime Day OLED TV deals\n\n\n\n\nLG OLED Evo C5 (65-inch) for $1,797 (down from $2,700): LG has steadily improved its C-series over the years, and the C5 Evo is its best model yet. In addition to the usual benefits of OLED, it also sports a brightness booster that can help it work well in bright rooms, as well as LG’s own “Perfect Color” technology. It doesn’t have quantum dots like Sony and Samsung’s OLEDs, but it’s also coming in significantly less than those models. The C5 Evo also has a fast 144Hz refresh rate for gaming, as well as support for NVIDIA’s G-SYNC and AMD FreeSync variable refresh rate technology. (If you’re looking for something larger, the 77-inch model has also been discounted to $2,800.)\nSony Bravia 8 II (65”) QD OLED for $2,998 (down from $3,500): Sony’s top of the line set has everything you’d want in a high-end TV, like quantum dots for improved color and brightness, as well as the inky dark blacks and infinite contrast of a modern OLED panel. You’ll always pay a bit of a premium for Sony TVs, but partially that’s due to their world-class image processing – in this case, that’s handled by Sony’s XR chip. (You can also snag the 55-inch model for $2,500.)\n\nBest Prime Day Mini LED TV deals\n\n\n\nTCL QM8K (65-inch) QD Mini LED for $998 (down from $1,800): TCL's QM8 sets feature the company's best and brightest Mini LED screens with Quantum Dots. It has an ultra-thin bezel, 144Hz refresh rate for fast gaming and one of the best contrast ratios you'll see outside of an OLED screen. Basically, it's one of the best screens you'll find that's not an OLED. While we think the 65-inch model is a great deal for most rooms, you can also step up to the 75-inch for $1,500, the 85-inch for $2,199 and the massive 98-inch set for $3,000. \nTCL QM6K (98-inch) QD Mini LED for $1,800 (down from $3,000 MSRP): The QM6K is one of the best deals we’ve seen on a 98-inch TV under $2,000, and best of all, it's not just a bargain bin screen. It has a bright Mini LED display with quantum dots for enhanced color, and it sports a fast 144Hz refresh rate for gaming. It’s also a pretty solid Prime Day deal, coming in much lower than the previous $2,200 low price. (If you don’t have the wall space for a nearly 100-inch set, the 65-inch model is similarly great and is down to $550, nearly half off its $1,000 MSRP and $100 off its lowest price. The 75-inch model is also a great deal at $850.)\nSony Bravia 5 (85-inch) Mini LED for $2,298 (down from $2,800): The Bravia 5 pairs a super bright Mini LED panel with Sony’s XR image processing chip. It won’t reach the deep dark black levels of OLED, but Mini LED achieves something close, and it can also get much brighter than OLED panels. That makes this model, as well as any Mini LED TV, an excellent option for bright rooms. (You can also scale down to the 65-inch and 75-inch Bravia 5 for $1,300 and $1,800, respectively. And there’s also the truly massive 98-inch model, which is now $1,000 off at $5,000.)\n\nBest Prime Day Frame-style TV deals\n\n\n\n\nSamsung The Frame (55-inch) for $798 (down from $1,498): This is one of the best deals we've seen on Samsung's Frame TVs, and it's a great option if you have a small living room. Frame sets don't look like typical electronics, instead their customizable bezels and glare-free screens make them look like works of art. The latest Frame sports Quantum Dots for enhanced color, a customizable bezel and offers access to 2,500 pieces of artwork in Samsung's online store.  \nSamsung The Frame Pro (65-inch) for $1,899 (down from $2,200): New for 2025, Samsung's Frame Pro sets offer brighter and higher-quality Mini LED panels for a superior TV watching experience. The 65-inch Frame Pro is a great option for most living rooms since it's large enough to deliver an immersive viewing experience, and it also comes with Samsung's wireless One Connect box for less cable clutter. (If you're looking for something larger, the 75-inch Frame Pro is down to $2,699, and the 85-inch is $3,799.) \nHisense S7N CanvasTV (65-inch) for $898 (down from $1,300): Hisense's spin on Samsung's Frame sets, the CanvasTV, comes in much cheaper and with a boatload of features. The S7N sports an anti-glare display and art mode, as you'd expect, but there's also 144Hz support for a bit of gaming. It also comes with a slim wall mount so you can hang it on your wall like a genuine work of art. (The 55-inch model is also a great deal at $689, and the 77-inch is down to $1,399.)   \n\nBest Prime Day budget TV deals\n\n\n\n\nAmazon Fire TV (50-inch) for $260 (down from $400): Amazon’s budget Fire TV sets handle the basics just fine, and at this price the 50-inch model is a compelling deal as a second or third TV set. It supports HDR10 (but not Dolby Vision), and as you’d expect, it also has the Amazon Fire TV OS built-in, giving you access to over 23,000 apps. It also sports Amazon’s Alexa Voice Remote to help you find content quickly. (You can also go up and down in size, depending on your needs. The 43-inch model is now down to $220, and it’d be a solid choice for a small bedroom or office.)\nHisense QD6 (55-inch) for $240 (down from $380): Hisense is on a roll delivering tons of TV features at a very low cost, and the QD6 line is a prime example of that. It has Amazon's Fire TV and Alexa support built in, and it also supports Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos. It can even handle a bit of fast gaming with a 120Hz refresh rate.\nTCL QM6K (55-inch) for $448 (down from $600): TCL's mid-range sets finally fall below $500 for Prime Day, and that makes the QM6K one of the higher quality options in this price range. It features a bright Mini LED panel, a 144Hz refresh rate for gaming and it even includes an Onkyo speaker setup built-in. While it's technically a budget set at this price, it certainly won't look like a low-grade TV.\nRoku Smart TV (32-inch) for $100 (down from $143): Not every room needs a large TV — this Roku Smart TV is perfect for a small bedroom or office. It's powered by Roku's OS and it comes with a Voice Remote. While it only offers a 720p resolution, that will still look decently sharp on a screen this small.\nRoku Smart TV (65-inch) for $250 (down from $350): Roku's basic smart TVs offer most of what you need: A decent 4K screen, a large selection of apps on Roku's platform and a Roku Voice Remote for easy browsing. These sets are ideal as secondary (or tertiary) TVs in rooms where you don't demand the best quality. (There are also some great deals on larger Roku Smart TVs: the 85-inch model is just $800, and the 75-inch version is $700.)   \n\nBest Prime Day soundbar and speaker deals\n\n\n\nSonos Beam Gen 2 for $369 (down from $499): Sonos's latest Beam is one of the best mid-range soundbars on the market. It's compact, but it also delivers expansive sound. And it also supports Dolby Atmos through a bit of speaker virtualization. The Beam is also ideal if you've already got Sonos speakers, since you can pair them all together for some household jams (or just bring your TV audio to different rooms).\nTCL S55H soundbar for $100 (down from $160): At this price, the TCL S55H delivers a ton of audio bang for the buck. It comes with a wireless subwoofer, features auto room calibration and supports virtualized surround sound like Dolby Atmos and DTS Virtual:X. With 220W of power behind its sound, the S55H should be powerful enough to fill most rooms.\nSony Bravia Theater Quad for $2,000 (down from $2,500): Leave it up to Sony to do something different in the world of home entertainment. The Bravia Theater Quad are a set of four flat modules, containing a total of sixteen speakers, which deliver truly enveloping surround sound. They’re the ideal solution for anyone who wants a theatrical experience, but doesn’t want to see gigantic tower or bookshelf speakers in their space. They support Sony’s 360 Spatial Sound Mapping, as well as Dolby Atmos and DTS:X.\nSony Bravia Theater Bar 9 for $998 (down from $1,400): The Bravia Theater Bar 9 is Sony’s most capable self-contained soundbar, with 13 speakers and support for virtualized surround sound with Dolby Atmos, DTS:X and Sony’s own 360 Spatial Sound Mapping technology. It’s the best option if you want to enjoy your favorite movies and music loud, but also don’t want to see speakers all over your living room. (The Bravia Theater 8 is also discounted to $698 and very well-equipped, with 11 speakers and the same surround sound support. )\nSony Bravia Theater System 6 for $568 (down from $770): If you want real surround sound from an actual subwoofer and satellite speakers spread around your room, the Bravia Theater System 6 is a solid choice. It pairs together a soundbar, wireless subwoofer and two rear satellites (connected by a wireless amplifier). It’s a great option for apartments and small living rooms where you just can’t live with virtualized surround sound. (You can also snag the soundbar on its own for $448, down from $650.)\n\nBest Prime Day streaming device deals\n\n\n\n\nRoku Ultra for $69 (down from $100): Roku's ultimate set-top box is the best streamer for home theater enthusiasts who want to avoid the more expensive Apple TV. It handles every video and audio format you'd want — including Dolby Vision, Atmos and HDR 10+ — and it also comes with Roku's rechargeable Voice Remote Pro. The Roku Ultra is the fastest device from the company, so you can expect to zip around Roku's interface and apps far quicker than the cheaper streaming sticks.\nRoku Streaming Stick+ for $30 (down from $40): The Roku Streaming Stick+ is the easiest way to bring Roku's robust app selection to any 4K TV. It's a great option for first-generation 4K sets that either had no streaming apps, or are way too slow by now. And it's a great gadgets to bring on trips to maintain access to all of your favorite streaming services.  \nRoku Streaming Stick HD For $20 (down from $30): The basic HD Roku Streaming stick is a solid option for bringing streaming apps to older TVs, which likely don't support 4K or any fancy HDR standards. Sure, it's as no frills as you can get, but for $20 it's worth having a backup streaming device. (or one you won't mind losing during a trip). And if you have an older TV that's still working, it's definitely worth investing a bit to get modern apps.\nAmazon Fire TV Stick 4K for $25 (down from $50): Amazon’s Fire TV Stick 4K is a simple way to add some streaming smarts to any TV with an HDMI port. Alternatively, you can load it up with your favorite streaming apps and bring it on the road – it sure beats fighting with apps built into hotel or AirBnb TVs. As a bonus, you can also play Xbox cloud streaming games when you pair a controller (Xbox GamePass membership required).     \nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/these-are-the-best-amazon-prime-day-tv-deals-from-sony-lg-samsung-and-others-to-get-before-the-sale-ends-084705582.html?src=rss",
    "full_text": "Who needs to shell out for the cinema when you can get an enormous screen and bombastic sound at a huge discount? Sony Bravia 8 II (65”) QD OLED for $2,998 (down from $3,500): Sony’s top of the line set has everything you’d want in a high-end TV, like quantum dots for improved color and brightness, as well as the inky dark blacks and infinite contrast of a modern OLED panel. (If you’re looking for something larger, the 77-inch model has also been discounted to $2,800.) It’s also a pretty solid Prime Day deal, coming in much lower than the previous $2,200 low price. Hisense S7N CanvasTV (65-inch) for $898 (down from $1,300) : Hisense's spin on Samsung's Frame sets, the CanvasTV, comes in much cheaper and with a boatload of features. The 65-inch Frame Pro is a great option for most living rooms since it's large enough to deliver an immersive viewing experience, and it also comes with Samsung's wireless One Connect box for less cable clutter. Samsung The Frame (55-inch) for $798 (down from $1,498): This is one of the best deals we've seen on Samsung's Frame TVs, and it's a great option if you have a small living room. The latest Frame sports Quantum Dots for enhanced color, a customizable bezel and offers access to 2,500 pieces of artwork in Samsung's online store. These sets are ideal as secondary (or tertiary) TVs in rooms where you don't demand the best quality. With 220W of power behind its sound, the S55H should be powerful enough to fill most rooms."

    "summary": "Amazon Prime Day can be a good time to upgrade your home theater setup thanks to all the tech deals we usually see. As was to be expected, Amazon has discounted nearly all of its own streaming devices, including the Fire TV Stick 4K Max, which is on sale for only $35 right now. That's nearly a record-low price and it represents a 42-percent discount, and today is the last day you can get it at that price.\nWhile we still prefer Amazon's Fire TV Stick HD as a budget streaming option, the Fire TV Stick 4K Max could be worth the upgrade for you. Amazon's device supports 4K video, Dolby Atmos, HDR10+ and if you have a newer router, Wi-Fi 6E. It's the best option if you're committed to the dongle-lifestyle — the even-more-powerful Fire TV Cube needs a TV stand to rest on — and a surprisingly great choice if you're looking for a capable retro game console. \n\n\nAmazon's also added in several features to the Fire TV Stick 4K Max that take it beyond a basic streamer. The built-in Ambient Experience lets the dongle display art and widgets when you're not using your TV, not unlike Samsung's The Frame and The Frame Pro. The Fire TV Stick 4K Max can also stream games from Xbox Game Pass using the Xbox app or Amazon Luna.\nThe only real reasons to not consider Amazon's platform is if you don't like using Alexa, which acts as the main voice interface for all Fire TVs, don't want to be pushed towards Amazon's services or your subscriptions are tangled up in another platform. You can buy subscriptions to a variety of streaming services and live channels through Amazon Prime Video, but if you've already done that on Apple TV+ for example, you might want to wait out your subscription before jumping ship. \nThis is just one of a few Fire TV deals you can snag for Prime Day. Others include the Fire TV Cube for $90 and the Fire TV Stick HD for $18.\n\n\n\n\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/prime-day-deal-its-the-last-day-to-get-the-fire-tv-stick-4k-max-for-only-35-122512498.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "While you can often find discounts on Echo speakers, Fire tablets, Kindles and other Amazon devices throughout the year, Amazon Prime Day is the best time to buy them, period. Prime Day is basically Black Friday for all Amazon-made gear, provided you’re a Prime member who can actually participate in the members-only shopping event. In recent years, Prime Day discounts on these gadgets have even been better than those we’ve seen during the holiday shopping season. For Amazon Prime Day 2025, you’ll find most of Amazon’s devices on sale for record-low prices (or close to them). These are the best Prime Day deals you can get on Kindles, Fire TVs, Echos and more for the last day of the sale.\nPrime Day Echo deals\n\n\nEcho Pop speaker for $22 (45 percent off): One of the newer Echo devices available, the Pop it sports a 1.95-inch front-facing speaker and a physical mic mute switch for extra privacy. The Pop also has built-in eero compatibility, so it can extend the area of your home Wi-Fi network if you already have an eero router system. \nEcho Buds for $45 (68 percent off): Amazon's main earbud offering, the Echo Buds are one of our top picks for the best budget wireless earbuds you can get right now. Their design allows some outside sound in, which some will prefer over total noise cancellation, and they have a comfortable design with a pocket-friendly case, automatic wear detection, multi-device connectivity and, of course, built-in Alexa voice controls.\nEcho Show 5 for $60 (33 percent off): This model is one of our favorite smart displays thanks to its compact design, ambient light sensor and sunrise alarm feature, all of which make it an excellent smart alarm clock. Amazon improved the speaker quality on this latest model, which gives sound deeper bass and clearer vocals.\nEcho Show 8 for $110 (27 percent off): This is our current top pick for the best smart display with Amazon’s Alexa thanks in part to its 8-inch touchscreen, 13MP camera that supports auto-framing for better video chats and its built-in Zigbee smart home hub. The 2023 model supports Visual ID, which will show personalized information on the device’s display depending on who’s using it, and video streaming from Netflix, Hulu, Prime Video and other services.\nPrime Day Kindle deals\n\n\nKindle Kids for $95 ($35 off): This is the same device as the base Kindle, but it becomes more kid-friendly thanks to the included cover, two-year warranty and the included year of Amazon Kids+, which gives children ages 3-12 access to hundreds of appropriate ebooks and audiobooks. Just be sure to take note when you activate that subscription because it will renew after one year at the standard $6/month rate.\nKindle Paperwhite for $125 ($35 off): The latest version of the Paperwhite has a seven-inch display, thinner bezels, an adjustable warm light, speedier page turns and a battery that can last up to 12 weeks on a single charge. This model is also IPX8 waterproof and has built-in Audible integration.\nKindle Colorsoft for $180 ($100 off): Amazon's only color e-reader has a seven-inch, high-contrast display, an auto-adjusting front light, a color highlighting feature and an eight-week battery life.\nKindle Scribe for $260 ($140 off): The Scribe is one of the best E-Ink tablets you can buy at the moment, and certainly the top pick if you want a writable table that also excels as an ereader. It provides a great reading and writing experience, thanks in part to its ability to access the entire Kindle ebook library, and it has handy Google Drive, Microsoft OneDrive and Dropbox integration.\nPrime Day Fire TV deals\n\n\nFire TV Stick 4K for $25 (50 percent off): This is the cheapest Fire TV Stick you can get to stream 4K content, plus it has support for Wi-Fi 6 and Dolby Vision and Atmos. With its live picture-in-picture feature, you can view security camera feeds right on your TV while you’re watching your favorite show or movie.\nFire TV Stick 4K Max for $35 (42 percent off): In addition to 4K HDR streaming with Dolby Vision and Atmos support, the 4K Max dongle includes Wi-Fi 6E connectivity, 16GB of built-in storage and live picture-in-picture capabilities. It also supports the Fire TV “ambient experience,” which lets you display photos and images on your TV screen when you’re not actively watching something.\nFire TV Cube streaming box for $90 (36 percent off): This model will provide the best performance of any Fire TV streaming device, and it supports 4K HDR content, Dolby Vision and Atmos and an enhanced version of the Alexa Voice Remote. Along with live picture-in-picture view and the Fire TV ambient experience, you can also hardware other devices to the Fire TV Cube including a cable box or a game console.\nPrime Day Fire tablet deals\n\n\nFire HD 8 tablet for $55 (45 percent off): This is Amazon's most bare-bones tablet, featuring an eight-inch HD touchscreen, hexa-core processor and 13 hours of battery life. The improvements in the screen quality alone from the old-school Fire 7 tablet make it a better buy for most people, and this slab would make a good couch device for general web browsing, email checking, online shopping and more.\nFire Max 11 tablet for $140 (39 percent off): Amazon’s most powerful tablet, the Fire Max 11 sports an 11-inch 2,000 x 1,200 touchscreen, an octa-core processor, up to 128GB of storage and 14 hours of battery life. It also works with a number of optional accessories, including a stylus and keyboard case.\nFire HD 10 Kids tablet for $105 (45 percent off): This slab is designed for kids aged three to seven, with full parental controls plus one year of Amazon Kids+ for free with the tablet purchase. This model has a 10-inch FHD touchscreen, an octa-core processor and 13 hours of battery life, plus it comes with a two-year warranty and a protective case.\nFire HD 10 Kids Pro tablet for $105 (45 percent off): This model is designed for kids aged six to 12 and comes with a slimmer protective case, a two-year warranty and one year of access to Amazon Kids+. Otherwise, you get a very similar experience here that you would with the non-Pro version, including parental controls, a 10-inch touchscreen, solid performance and a 13-hour battery life.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/best-prime-day-deals-on-amazon-devices-its-the-last-day-to-get-up-to-68-percent-off-kindle-ereaders-echo-speakers-and-more-082012880.html?src=rss",

Let's dive a little deeper into the main considerations, starting with our performance tests. To find out, we use sand as an analog for finer particles. It tends to be more challenging for robot vacuums (though again, not always). From there, we repeat each run two more times and average the results. We now use the sand test as our primary benchmark in evaluating cleaning performance. We consider anything 50% and above to be a good score for sand. The ideal cleaner will make easy work of finding its way from room to room and automatically avoiding obstacles along the way, all of which makes for proper, low-maintenance automated cleaning. Below is an example from the Ecovacs Deebot T30S, our best overall. In large part, it comes down to the tech at play."

    "full_text": "Starlink has brought high-speed internet to millions of rural Americans for the first time. So, how is it available in New York for just $15 a month? That’s thanks to the Affordable Broadband Act, a New York state law passed in January. The law says that major ISPs (those serving 20,000 households or more) operating in New York must offer plans starting at $15 per month with download speeds of at least 25Mbps to qualifying households, or a $20-per-month plan with minimum download speeds of 200Mbps. Some providers, like AT&T, chose to pull out of the state entirely rather than offer the discounted prices that New York’s law requires. Households are eligible for these plans if they have an annual income up to 185% of the federal poverty level -- $59,477.50 for a family of four -- or if they participate in programs like the National School Lunch Program, Medicaid or SNAP. (PCMag is owned by the same parent company as CNET, Ziff Davis.) According to 2023 data from the Benton Institute for Broadband & Society, nearly 30% of households making under $35,000 per year do not have internet in the state, compared with 13% for households earning between $35,000 to $75,000 and only 4% for households earning over $75,000. But access to fast and reliable internet is still a challenge for many people in rural New York. The most recent FCC data shows that about 3% of homes in New York don’t have access to the FCC’s definition of minimum broadband speeds: 100Mbps download and 20Mbps upload."

Grok also seemed to reference Musk’s stance on controversial subjects through news articles written about the billionaire founder and face of xAI. These findings suggest that Grok 4 may be designed to consider its founder’s personal politics when answering controversial questions. Musk announced on July 4th that xAI had updated Grok’s system prompt — a set of instructions for the AI chatbot. Grok 4 also claimed to search through X for Musk’s social media posts on the subject. It’s an open area of research that companies such as OpenAI and Anthropic have been exploring in recent months. Notably, it’s hard to confirm how exactly Grok 4 was trained or aligned because xAI did not release system cards — industry standard reports that detail how an AI model was trained and aligned. Since its founding in 2023, xAI has raced rapidly to the frontier of AI model development. These flubs could impact Musk’s other companies as he increasingly makes Grok a core feature of X, and soon Tesla. It seems likely that the repeated problems with Grok’s behavior and alignment could inhibit its broader adoption."

    "full_text": "Cloud seeding is basically an attempt to make precipitation fall from clouds. This creates heavier ice particles that can eventually fall down to the ground. After horrific flash floods in central Texas killed at least 120 people over the July 4th weekend, a flurry of social media posts blamed cloud seeding. One startup called Rainmaker has borne the brunt of attacks that have turned into violent threats. “Anyone who calls this out as a conspiracy theory can go F themselves,” Flynn wrote on X. Inflaming things further, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) announced on July 5th that she would introduce a bill that would make a felony offense out of “the injection, release, or dispersion of chemicals or substances into the atmosphere for the express purpose of altering weather.” There isn’t even consensus on how helpful cloud seeding can be to help ease a water shortage. So it’s even less likely to have the opposite problem. Cloud seeding does not add more moisture to the atmosphere than what’s already present, Swain explains in his YouTube office hour.

In California, companies that want to test and eventually deploy autonomous vehicles have to receive a series of different permits from the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV). Those permits cover the various stages of testing autonomous vehicles with and without a human safety operator behind the wheel, and eventually deploying a driverless vehicle. However, companies that want to operate a robotaxi service must also receive permits from the California Public Utilities Commission. A California DMV spokesperson said in an emailed statement that Tesla has held an autonomous vehicle testing permit for public road testing with a safety driver since 2014. “To date, Tesla has not applied for either a driverless testing or deployment permit.” The process in Arizona isn’t as arduous, although there are steps to navigate. Under Arizona statute, autonomous vehicle companies are required to follow a self-certification process for either testing with or without a driver, as outlined on the ADOT website."

    "full_text": "Bailey’s press release and letters to all four companies accuse Gemini, Copilot, ChatGPT, and Meta AI of making “factually inaccurate” claims to “simply ferret out facts from the vast worldwide web, package them into statements of truth and serve them up to the inquiring public free from distortion or bias,” because the chatbots “provided deeply misleading answers to a straightforward historical question.” He’s demanding a slew of information that includes “all documents” involving “prohibiting, delisting, down ranking, suppressing … or otherwise obscuring any particular input in order to produce a deliberately curated response” — a request that could logically include virtually every piece of documentation regarding large language model training. “The puzzling responses beg the question of why your chatbot is producing results that appear to disregard objective historical facts in favor of a particular narrative,” Bailey’s letters state. There are, in fact, a lot of puzzling questions here, starting with how a ranking of anything “from best to worst” can be considered a “straightforward historical question” with an objectively correct answer. Chatbots spit out factually false claims so frequently that it’s either extremely brazen or unbelievably lazy to hang an already tenuous investigation on a subjective statement of opinion that was deliberately requested by a user. As Techdirt points out, the site itself says Copilot refused to produce a ranking — which didn’t stop Bailey from sending a letter to Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella demanding an explanation for slighting Trump. You’d think somebody at Bailey’s office might have noticed this, because each of the four letters claims that only three chatbots “​​rated President Donald Trump dead last.” Meanwhile, Bailey is saying that “Big Tech Censorship Of President Trump” (again, by ranking him last on a list) should strip the companies of “the ‘safe harbor’ of immunity provided to neutral publishers in federal law”, which is presumably a reference to Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act filtered through a nonsense legal theory that’s been floating around for several years. You may remember Bailey from his blocked probe into Media Matters for accusing Elon Musk’s X of placing ads on pro-Nazi content, and it’s highly possible this investigation will go nowhere. Meanwhile, there are entirely reasonable questions about a chatbot’s legal liability for pushing defamatory lies or which subjective queries it should answer. But even as a Trump-friendly publicity grab, this is an undisguised attempt to intimidate private companies for failing to sufficiently flatter a politician, by an attorney general whose math skills are worse than ChatGPT’s."

Hoto’s mini electric screwdriver has become indispensable in my household for little projects, even beyond fixing kids toys. The compact electric screwdriver features dual torque settings, with a simple one-button start. It’s roughly the size of a permanent marker, and on the rear end, there’s a USB-C port for charging. Everything comes housed in a rugged case, which features tiny labels for every component, ensuring they’re always in their correct place. But for my needs, this kit has come in clutch more times than I can count. That’s far from the only Hoto gear on sale for Prime Day. It can inflate tires up to 150PSI and features a digital display where you can assign two customizable presets, which is perfect for frequently filling the same tires."

    "full_text": "Sonos Roam: Available in white or black for $179, the Roam is currently the smallest and most affordable Sonos speaker (if you don't count those $99 Sonos-compatible Symfonisk Ikea Wi-Fi bookshelf speakers), although it's fairly expensive for a mini wireless speaker. Besides sounding decent for streaming your favorite music and more, this affordable Bluetooth speaker is also fully waterproof. (There's a companion app for iOS and Android that allows you to alter the colorful lighting effects.) Its 2-inch full-range driver and two passive radiators put out more sound than you'd think it would for its tiny size, and it offers decent clarity as well as just enough bass to avoid sounding tinny (you can choose from three preset sound modes). Bang & Olufsen Beosound A1 (2nd Gen): A couple of years ago, Bang & Olufsen upgraded its dome-shaped aluminum-clad A1 speaker with improved battery life, better speakerphone performance (it now has a three-microphone array) and slightly improved sound. You can learn more about the small-but-mighty B&O Beousound A1 in our full review. It's a good value thanks to its ability to play big sound with strong bass and decent clarity, with 50 watts of power that drives a 5.25-inch \"concave aluminum cone woofer\" flanked by two 1-inch silk-dome tweeters. Tribit is billing the XSound Mega as more of an outdoor speaker — a lanyard is included for toting it around as a sort of mini boombox — but it works just fine indoors. Additionally, it can be used as a power bank to charge your mobile devices. Tribit's XSound speakers are probably a better value, but the StormBox is more stylish."

Wired home security cameras that don't use Wi-Fi at all are generally more secure. (Read more about the pros and cons of wired vs. wireless systems here.) In simplest terms, your camera won't be effective if the only footage being recorded is grainy and unreadable. The average security camera tends to top out around 130 degrees, although some go beyond that. They tend to be more reliable, secure and consistent in video quality while not requiring monthly cloud storage fees. Some Wired home security cameras (like the Google Nest Cam Indoor) typically have better video and audio quality. You have two main options and picking one is up to your personal preference. These make the video quality poor and home security cameras a pain to use. Take a look at my home security camera buying guide and the below FAQs."

    "summary": "We're continually updating this list of the best Apple deals. This week, thanks to Amazon's Prime Day, we're seeing some of the best prices on Apple gear we've seen so far. And other retailers, like Best Buy, Walmart, Target and B&H Photo are matching those discounts. So if you don't feel like shopping on Amazon, you have options. Of course, that also means that most of the discounts will expire when Amazon's sale ends on Friday. So if you see something on sale, you may want to buy. For iPads, Apple Watches, AirPods and MacBooks, these are the best Apple deals you'll find on the web right now. \nBest iPad deals\n\n\nApple iPad Air (M3, 11-inch) for $479 ($120 off): The only major difference between the latest iPad Air and the previous generation is the addition of the faster M3 chip. We awarded the new slab an 89 in our review, appreciating the fact that the M3 chip was about 16 percent faster in benchmark tests than the M2. This is the iPad to get if you want a reasonable amount of productivity out of an iPad that's more affordable than the Pro models. Also at Best Buy and Walmart. \nApple iPad Air (13-inch, M3) for $679 ($120 off): This is Apple’s most affordable large-screen iPad. Engadget’s Nate Ingraham awarded it a review score of 89 upon its debut this March. When you pair it with accessories like a keyboard folio and mouse, it becomes a true productivity machine — though those add-ons make it a pricey package. Good thing iPads are on sale for Prime Day. This $120 discount represents the lowest price we've seen. Also at Best Buy. \niPad Pro (M4, 11-inch) for $899 ($100 off): The most powerful iPad is the iPad Pro, and it’s the one to get if you’re even toying with the idea of using your new slab as a laptop replacement. Both the 11- and 13-inch models have gorgeous displays, thinner and lighter designs, a repositioned front camera and the excessively powerful M4 chip inside. Also at Best Buy. \niPad mini (7th gen) for $399 ($100 off): This is the iPad to get if you prefer small tablets, akin to ereaders. The latest mini is equipped with an A17 Pro chipset, an 8.3-inch Liquid Retina display and Apple Intelligence. We consider it to be the best small tablet, period, and we appreciate its Apple Pencil Pro support, 128GB of storage on the base model and compact design. Also at Target.\nBest Apple AirPods deals\n\n\nAirPods Pro 2 for $199 ($50 off): These are the best wireless earbuds for Apple users, period. The latest models have improved ANC and transparency mode, along with good battery life, spatial audio and hands-free Siri. They also have MagSafe charging support and work with Apple’s \"clinically validated” hearing test. Also at Walmart. \nAirPods 4 (with ANC) for $119 ($60 off): Apple introduced the fourth generation of its basic earbuds alongside the iPhone 16 last September. This model includes ANC — a first for Apple’s “regular” buds — and Billy awarded them an 86 in his review. Just note they don’t have a fully closed design like the Pro models — but some may prefer the open fit, which Apple completely redesigned to fit more securely.\nAirPods 4 (without ANC) for $89 ($40 off): Apple introduced two models of its fourth generation basic earbuds alongside the iPhone 16 last September. This one doesn't have the extra features of ANC or Transparency Mode (making them cheaper). This pared down model benefits from a shape redesign — which our headphone expert, Billy Steele, found both more comfortable and more secure — as well as improved sound quality that’s more immersive than before. Also at Walmart. \nBest MacBook and Mac deals\n\n\nApple MacBook Air (15-inch, M3, 24GB RAM) for $1,249 at Amazon ($450 off with coupon): The last-gen M3 MacBook Air has officially been discontinued, but it remains a superb laptop while the last bits of stock remain available. We gave this 15-inch model a score of 90 in our review — outside of its slower chip (which is still plenty fast for everyday use), marginally improved camera and inability to power two external displays with the lid open, it's virtually identical to the newer version. This deal requires you to click the on-page coupon and applies to the model with the larger 24GB of memory in the Starlight colorway. \nApple MacBook Air (15-inch, M4) for $1,049 at Amazon ($150 off): The 15-inch MacBook Air is nearly identical to the smaller version but features more robust speakers and a more spacious trackpad alongside its roomier display. Also at B&H.\nMacBook Air (M3, 15-inch) for $999 at B&H ($400 off): The last-gen M3 MacBook Air has officially been discontinued, but it remains a superb laptop while the last bits of stock remain available. We gave this 15-inch model a score of 90 in in our review — outside of its slower chip (which is still plenty fast for everyday use), marginally improved camera and inability to power two external displays with the lid open, it's virtually identical to the newer version.  \nBest Apple Watch deals\n\n\nApple Watch SE for $169 (32 percent off): We wouldn’t be surprised to see an update to Apple’s budget smartwatch sometime soon (and we have a few suggestions on the matter). But thanks to some serious discounts, the Apple Watch SE has turned out to be the most affordable way to get an iPhone companion for your wrist. Despite the lackluster screen and limited extra features, it handles the basics well. Also at Best Buy and Walmart. \nApple Watch Ultra 2 for $650 ($149 off with Prime): The second generation of Apple’s premium smartwatch came out in 2023 along with the iPhone 15 (last September it just got a new Titanium Black colorway. The Ultra model is geared towards serious athletes and outdoor adventurers, packing specialized features like a 40-meter depth gauge, dual-frequency GPS and an on-board siren. Also at Best Buy. \nBest Apple accessories deals\nApple Pencil (USB-C) for $59 at Amazon ($20 off): This more affordable Apple Pencil doesn’t support pressure sensitivity, but it still makes for a useful stylus for the basics. If you’re a casual note-taker and can live without wireless charging, you’ll save a few bucks by picking this one up. Also at Best Buy, Walmart.\nApple AirTags (4-pack) for $65 at Amazon ($35 off): We think most iPhone owners will appreciate how easy it is to keep track of things like wallets, keys or handbags with a set of AirTags. These Bluetooth trackers monitor the location of your belongings so you can check in on them using the Find My app. Those with newer iPhones can also use UWB technology to get turn-by-turn directions to find their stuff when the AirTag is within close range. Also at Walmart.\nApple Pencil (2nd gen) for $90 ($39 off): The Second gen Pencil both attaches and charges magnetically, supports tilt and pressure sensitivity and allows for tool changes with a tap of the flat edge. It’s an older pencil and isn’t compatible with the latest iPad models. This is the lowest price we’ve tracked this year, but it went as low as $80 for last year’s Black Friday sales. Also at Walmart. \nRead more Apple coverage:\n\nThe best AirPods\nThe best Apple Watches\nThe best MacBooks\nThe best iPhones\nThe best iPads\n\nFollow @EngadgetDeals on X for the latest tech deals and buying advice.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/best-apple-deals-150020110.html?src=rss",

And every single investor in Silicon Valley is bullish on startups building them — even if there is some disagreement on exactly what defines an AI agent. The term is somewhat ambiguous and is loosely used to describe computer programs that can make decisions and perform tasks independently, such as interacting with software, by using an AI model at the backend. Anthropic, which already has Amazon’s backing and is reportedly in line for another multibillion-dollar investment from the e-commerce company, views AI’s future primarily in terms of agents — at least for the coming years. Anthropic builds AI agents in-house and enables developers to create them using its API. Save $450 on your TechCrunch All Stage pass Build smarter. Anthropic’s involvement in the marketplace could also attract more developers to use its API to create more agents, and eventually increase its revenues. Like any other online marketplace, AWS will take a cut of the revenue that startups earn from agent installations. The marketplace model will allow startups to charge customers for agents. Amazon is not the first tech giant to offer a marketplace for agents."

It also comes with three months of free ink, based on a standard use if you sign up for HP Plus. While HP Plus gives you extra helpful app choices free and the ink, the downside is you can only use HP inks while subscribed to it. The last model had some issues with graphics and imagery, but this new upgrade is much better. If you work from home but need all the advantages of an office printer, the OfficeJet Pro is an excellent choice. In terms of sheer printing speed, the HP is ahead of most inkjets in its price range. It printed the 10 pages in just 32 seconds and scanned and printed them in 58 seconds. If you're a hard-core image connoisseur looking to print dozens of high-resolution images, there are better machines for you. The OfficeJet Pro 9125e is so good because it's a generalist for the average person working from home or a small family. You'll need a laserjet for that."

    "full_text": "The Creative Stage delivers a compelling mix of sound quality and features at an ultra-affordable price. It includes both a separate subwoofer and an HDMI ARC input, something that's unheard of at this price. The system comes with a comprehensive remote control, which includes four sound modes and independent volume control for the sub. When set to gaming mode, the Creative system was able to keep up with gunfire, explosions and spatial cues without folding into a hard ball of distortion. The Creative Stage is especially well-suited for PC gamers who want to make every penny count. Its compact dimensions make it ideal for smaller spaces and TVs for those on a tight budget -- its sound will trounce the built-in speakers of just about any TV. The connectivity options make it versatile for various setups: it includes Bluetooth wireless, an optical input, HDMI ARC and even a USB port for playing MP3s from an external drive. Due to the physical length restrictions of the cabinet, it offers little stereo separation when heard from a couch -- it's all vocals and mostly mono at that distance. The subwoofer is tethered by an 8-foot cable that, while perfect for going under a desk, isn't long enough to be effective when placed alongside a couch in a living room setup. Music enthusiasts might find the Creative less engaging than competitors, and while it does well with movies and TV shows compared to systems without a soundbar, it can't compete with its competitors’ ability to go much louder without losing control."

Samsung unveiled three new foldables at Unpacked: The premium book-style Galaxy Z Fold 7, the clamshell Galaxy Z Flip 7 and the more affordable clamshell Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE (for Fan Edition). Preorder any of them and get a free storage upgrade -- the Z Fold 7 and Z Flip 7 at 512GB (up from 256GB), while the Z Flip 7 FE at 256GB (up from 126GB). At 8.9mm thick when folded closed and weighing 215 grams, it's about the size and heft of a standard flat smartphone. Measuring 4.2mm thick when unfolded, it's even thinner than the 5.8mm Galaxy S25 Edge that came out earlier this year. As rumors suggested, the $900 Z Flip 7 FE appears similar to the Galaxy Z Flip 6 and is $200 cheaper, though it swaps out the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chip for an Exynos 2400 processor to keep that price down. If you're eager to get your hands on one of the latest devices, you can head to Samsung's site and preorder your future phone and score free storage upgrades.

Shark Week officially runs this year from July 20-26 and features more than 20 new specials or shows about one of the most deadly and/or misunderstood creatures around. Not only has Netflix released these two original titles to great success in the past two weeks, but you can also catch all four Jaws films on the platform starting on July 15 (that film is celebrating its 50th anniversary and is also available on Peacock as of this summer, which makes it feel like an especially momentous season for sharks). That film is part of Nat Geo's Sharkfest slate of programming, which has been running this week and is a different beast from Shark Week... even though it's all about the same beast. (It really feels like ABC missed an opportunity by not airing new episodes of Shark Tank this summer. After 37 years of programming, it's hard to believe Shark Week hasn't actually jumped the shark (although there is a new show hosted by Tom Bergeron called Dancing With Sharks that actually features divers \"dancing\" with sharks... but I admit my curiosity is piqued). Shark Week appears stronger than ever and seems to have unofficially become Shark Month thanks to the shows that Netflix and other platforms have already released. To be clear, Netflix never officially said it's a Shark Week competitor; it's just been savvy about scheduling its new programs when people might be looking for shark content -- and it turns out there's room for all of them. If we've learned anything in the past 50 years, it's that it's never a bad thing to have a bigger boat."

I have a very tight and small jaw, so this brush was uncomfortable for me to use. I also couldn’t justify the price when a less expensive brush could clean my teeth better.

The post says that this doesn't apply to reused content that adds \"significant original commentary, modifications, or educational or entertainment value to the original video.\" YouTube cites as examples of \"mass-produced content\" channels that upload narrated stories with only superficial differences between them and channels that upload slideshows that all have the same narration. What's not mentioned in the post or the video is that YouTube has been battling a problem with AI-generated videos, particularly \"AI slop\" that is of low value to users but that is inundating social media networks and platforms. YouTube's guidelines don't mention AI slop specifically, but some of its examples of \"altered or synthetic content\" would seem to include some types of AI-generated videos.

This carpet cleaner isn’t ideal for anyone who struggles with dexterity or carrying it up and down stairs. As the second loudest, this carpet cleaner might not be good for those with sensitive hearing or for use while children are sleeping, as you might wake them (like I did)."

On Thursday, the former Intel CEO revealed one piece of his next chapter: trying to ensure AI models support a flourishing humanity. In partnership with a “faith tech” company he first invested in roughly 10 years ago called Gloo, Gelsinger launched a new benchmark — Flourishing AI, or FAI — to test how well AI models align with certain human values. The FAI benchmark is based on The Global Flourishing Study, a survey directed by Harvard and Baylor University, to measure human well-being around the world. Gloo took six core categories from the study — Character and Virtue, Close Social Relationships, Happiness and Life Satisfaction, Meaning and Purpose, Mental and Physical Health, Financial and Material Stability — and added one more, Faith and Spirituality, to test LLMs. In an interview with The New Stack, Gelsinger said he’s “lived at the intersection of faith tech my entire life.”"

The move to terminate a line of smart home products leaves consumers without access to technology that has become integrated into their daily lives — this isn’t just a child’s toy going offline; it’s more essential. It’s becoming increasingly common for companies to simply end support for their older smart home products without any technical reason to do so. In April, the tech giant said it would no longer support its earliest generation of Nest Learning Thermostats. While that may be a good deal, being forced to upgrade due to obsolescence does not go over well with many customers whose devices still work just fine, despite their age. However, this process does protect Google from facing class action lawsuits, which could result if it just shut down this many smart devices and the Nest app at once. By pushing these customers off the Nest app and incentivizing them to upgrade to newer devices, Google could argue that usage of the older devices was actually fairly low if a lawsuit were raised. That could reduce any fines or compensation that such a suit could result in and make it easier for Google and, perhaps, eventually shut down the Nest app."

    "summary": "Amazon's Prime Day is in full swing, and now that two full days have passed, some of us have gotten past our decision paralysis and checked out our online shopping carts. It's no surprise that the Engadget team consists of people who are fans of tech (and non-tech) products, and we also love a good deal. As we've put together roundups and news stories about the best things to buy this week, we've also been tempted by the savings. Here's a list of what several of our team members bought, not only to share our lives with you but to also show you some of the deals we deemed good enough to spend our own money on. \n\n\n(Ed. note: Igor Bonifacic saved a whopping $2 on this guitar tuner, but it was worth it to him. I'll let him explain.) \nIn Canada, the D'Addario tuner I ended up buying is normally a little more expensive at $20 CAD, but I figured there was a chance it would go on sale for Prime Day. So I set up a Camelcamelcamel alert, and on the morning of July 8 I got an email from the website saying it was… $2 off. Not the greatest discount, but hey, in such an expensive hobby, every dollar counts, right?\nThis past spring, I picked up the guitar for the first time in about 15 years. How it happened doesn't matter. What does matter is that now I play everyday, and I've been asking myself why did I ever stop in the first place. I feel more creative, my eyes feel healthier from less screen time and I'm better now than I ever was as a teenager.\nAs I've gotten back into the hobby, I've slowly been buying all the little accessories that can make it easier to maintain your guitar. With Prime Day around the corner, I set my sights on a headstock tuner. These little gadgets weren't around when I first started learning the instrument, but let me tell you they're great.\nLike the name suggests, you attach one to the headstock of your guitar. It then allows you to tune the instrument by measuring the vibrations produced by the strings. While you could just as easily use an app like GuitarTuna to do the same, clip-on tuners aren't affected by ambient noise, making the entire tuning process fast and easy. Best of all, they're cheap. In the US, you can spend as little as $15 to buy the model I purchased for Prime Day. — Igor Bonifacic, senior reporter\n\n\nWithout even trying, I've become a devotee of Apple's Continuity Camera over the last few years. I think with my laptop and monitor setup, it's just always made more sense to use my iPhone as a camera rather than buying some kind of USB-C docking station or giving up another port on my computer. Unfortunately, I also find having my phone within arm's reach while I'm writing to be pretty distracting. Taking advantage of a Prime Day deal on a dedicated webcam this year is my solution.\nI purchased an off-white Logitech Brio 500, which normally costs $130, but is $50 off for Prime Day through Amazon or Logitech. It's a kind of a long, tube-shaped 1080p webcam, so not the sleekest or best option out there, but it has the basics I need, like a manual shutter and auto-framing, and critically, it matches my Logitech mouse. If, like me, you can't stand the idea of paying over $100 for a webcam, I think it's a pretty appealing option at $80. — Ian Carlos Campbell, contributing writer\n\n\n\nI recently discovered that as all my gear transitioned to USB-C, I no longer had any compatible thumb drives. Rather than buy an adapter dongle that I would inevitably lose, I figured it would be smart to have a new thumb drive that could handle both USB-C and USB-3. The discount on the SanDisk drive I bought wasn't huge, but Prime Day seemed like a good time to save a few bucks on a practical purchase. — Anna Washenko, contributing reporter\n\n\nEven though it wasn't on sale this week, I pre-ordered a re-issue for the Studio Series version of Blaster from Amazon because he is one of my favorite Transformers of all time. And then I added Soundwave to my shipment because he's another one of my top 10 favorite bots and you can't really have one without the other. And then I found a small deal on Heatwave, so we picked that up too as a way to save a couple bucks on a present for my son's birthday next month.\nIt's a bit weird to say that as an adult I'm still this fascinated by plastic toys, but sometimes it feels like we're living through a golden age for Transformer figures despite the awful movies we've been subjected to over the last decade and a half (aside from Transformers One). As bad as the Bayverse films are, there's still a rich history of shows and toys and I've had a blast diving back into all of that with my kid. — Sam Rutherford, senior reviewer\n\n\nI made a very short, focused list of three things to buy on Prime Day — a Nori Press, a walking pad and the Ms. Rachel Tonie toy for the kids in my life. But when I was looking through our roundup of the best deals this week, the discounted entry-level iPad caught my eye. \nMy dad had been asking me repeatedly for weeks about an iPad for watching videos and movies while him and my mom were traveling, and I wasn't able to give them an answer as I was weighing a lot of concerns. What is the best operating system for them? Do they need something released recently, or could they save some money on an older model? \nSeeing this current-generation iPad on sale prompted me to just buy it for them. It simplifies things as my dad uses an iPhone and is familiar with iPadOS, and apps like YouTube and Netflix would satisfy their desires to download videos to watch offline. Saving $70 on what is a very solid device felt like a great deal, but more importantly it earned me points with my family. — Cherlynn Low, managing editor\nWhat we're still considering\nAs Prime Day goes on till the end of the week, many on the Engadget team are still weighing their decisions. Executive editor John Falcone, for example, hasn't bought Anker's UFO 3-device charger, but says he wishes he did. I'll update this post if he does, because he will save almost 30 percent on it.\nNot all our purchases have been through Amazon, either. Editor-in-chief Aaron Souppouris is thinking about buying \"a weird camera for too much money not on Amazon.\" It's a full-spectrum conversion camera, and if and when he does make that purchase, we will be sure to shame him here.\nFinally, senior editor Billy Steele has made arguably the best shopping decision all week, on or off Amazon. He bought \"three Happy Meals trying to get the cool toys. I got three of the same toy. :(\" \nUpdate, July 10 2025, 5:00PM ET: This story has been updated to add a section on what senior reviewer Sam Rutherford bought.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/amazon-prime-day-2025-the-deals-that-the-engadget-team-spent-our-hard-earned-money-on-154509453.html?src=rss",

    "full_text": "There are a ton of laptops on the market at any given moment and almost all of those models are available in multiple configurations to match your performance and budget needs. If you're feeling overwhelmed with options when looking for a new laptop, it's understandable. When deciding on a screen, there are a myriad number of considerations: How much you need to display (which is surprisingly more about resolution than screen size), what types of content you'll be looking at and whether you'll be using it for gaming or creative work. You can always make things bigger on a high-resolution screen, but you can never make them smaller -- to fit more content in the view -- on a low-resolution screen. There are some games and creative software that won't run unless they detect a dGPU or sufficient VRAM. For memory, I highly recommend 16GB of RAM (8GB absolute minimum). Most manufacturers disclose this but if the RAM type is LPDDR, assume it's soldered and can't be upgraded. Some PC makers will solder memory on and also leave an empty internal slot for adding a stick of RAM. Not all SSDs are equally speedy, and cheaper laptops typically have slower drives; if the laptop only has 4GB or 8GB of RAM, it may end up swapping to that drive and the system may slow down quickly while you're working. The one exception is gaming laptops: I don't recommend going with less than a 512GB SSD unless you really like uninstalling games every time you want to play a new game."

It's worth adding that while TVs can get really big indeed, 4K resolution is sufficient for even the biggest models, and CNET doesn't recommend any 8K TVs as they represent a poor comparative value. It's also best to shop for a TV in the fall when prices are lower. While I do test the audio on each model, if you are serious about sound quality then buying a separate soundbar (from $100) or home theater system will instantly improve vital aspects such as speech and bass reproduction."

    "summary": "Subnautica 2 is one of the most highly anticipated games around. It's the second-most wishlisted game on Steam behind (you guessed it) Hollow Knight: Silksong. However, you'll need to wait longer than anticipated to try Subnautica 2 in four-player co-op, as the survival game's early access release has been delayed until early 2026.\nDeveloper Unknown Worlds said that community members who took part in playtests provided positive feedback about the story, creatures, environment and general direction of the game. However, the studio said, they \"also provided some insight that there are a few areas where we needed to improve before launching the first version of Subnautica 2 to the world. Our community is at the heart of how we develop, so we want to give ourselves a little extra time to respond to more of that feedback before releasing the game into early access. With that in mind, we’ve made the decision to delay Subnautica 2’s early access release to 2026.\"\n\nThe delay will afford Unknown Worlds a chance to add more biomes, tools, vehicle upgrades and creatures while expanding the story, the studio said. Players can expect more details in the coming months.\nBut news of the delay comes amid behind-the-scenes drama at Unknown Worlds. Bloomberg reports that the studio had been in line for a $250 million bonus (which the leadership group planned to share with employees) from Krafton if it hit revenue goals by the end of this year. The delay reportedly means Unknown Worlds is very unlikely to hit those targets. As such, Bloomberg's sources suggest that means the team of around 100 people may not be eligible for the payout.\nLast week, Krafton — which bought Unknown Worlds in 2021 — turfed out the studio's leadership team of CEO Ted Gill and co-founders Charlie Cleveland and Max McGuire. The publisher brought in Steve Papoutsis, a former executive at The Callisto Protocol developer Striking Distance, as the new CEO of Unknown Worlds.\n\"There is nothing more important than the gamer experience. Given the anticipation around Subnautica 2, we owe our players nothing less than the best possible game, as soon as possible,\" Krafton CEO CH Kim said in a statement, \"We are thrilled Steve is joining us in our shared commitment at Krafton and Unknown Worlds to deliver Subnautica 2 as a more complete and satisfying entry in the series — one that truly lives up to player expectations.\"\nPer Bloomberg, Papoutsis told employees this week that Krafton didn't believe Subnautica 2 was ready for an early access release and claimed he didn't know the specifics of the contract regarding the quarter-billion-dollar bonus. \"It’s never been told to me that we’re making this change specifically to impact any earnout or anything like that,\" he reportedly told staff.\nAccording to Cleveland, however, Subnautica 2 is actually \"ready for early access release.\" The studio's co-founder wrote in a lengthy X post on July 5 that \"while we thought this was going to be our decision to make, at least for now, that decision is in Krafton’s hands.\"\nA Krafton spokesperson told Eurogamer that the decision to delay Subnautica 2 was \"based solely on our commitment to quality and to delivering the best possible experience for players\" and it was not \"influenced by any contractual or financial considerations.\" They added that \"the decision had already been under discussion prior to recent leadership changes at the studio.\"\nUpdate, July 10, 3:15PM ET: In a statement shared with Engadget, Krafton provided additional context around the terms of the $250 million bonus payment and reiterated its commitment to Unknown Worlds going forward. The studio said the current version of Subnautica 2 falls short of expectations, and laid the blame at Cleveland and McGuire's feet.\n\"The former leadership abandoned the responsibilities entrusted to them,\" the statement said. \"Subnautica 2 was originally planned for an Early Access launch in early 2024, but the timeline has since been significantly delayed. Krafton made multiple requests to Charlie and Max to resume their roles as Game Director and Technical Director, respectively, but both declined to do so. In particular, following the failure of Moonbreaker, Krafton asked Charlie to devote himself to the development of Subnautica 2. However, instead of participating in the game development, he chose to focus on a personal film project. Krafton believes that the absence of core leadership has resulted in repeated confusion in direction and significant delays in the overall project schedule.\"\nKrafton's full statement reads as follows:\nTo Our 12 Million Fellow Subnauts,—  Inevitable Leadership Change Driven by Project Abandonment–Despite Holding 90% of Earnout for ThemselvesFirst and foremost, we sincerely thank you for your continued support, passion, and unwavering dedication to Subnautica. We wish to provide clarity on the recent leadership changes at Unknown Worlds, a creative studio under KRAFTON.Background of Leadership Change\nKRAFTON deeply values Subnautica’s unique creativity and immersive world-building. To provide fans with even better gaming experiences, we acquired Unknown Worlds, fully committed to supporting Subnautica’s future success. We collaborated closely with the studio’s leadership, who were central to the creation of the original Subnautica, to foster the optimal environment for a successful Subnautica 2.Specifically, in addition to the initial $500 million purchase price, we allocated approximately 90% of the up to $250 million earn-out compensation to the three former executives, with the expectation that they would demonstrate leadership and active involvement in the development of Subnautica 2.However, regrettably, the former leadership abandoned the responsibilities entrusted to them. Subnautica 2 was originally planned for an Early Access launch in early 2024, but the timeline has since been significantly delayed. KRAFTON made multiple requests to Charlie and Max to resume their roles as Game Director and Technical Director, respectively, but both declined to do so. In particular, following the failure of Moonbreaker, KRAFTON asked Charlie to devote himself to the development of Subnautica 2. However, instead of participating in the game development, he chose to focus on a personal film project.KRAFTON believes that the absence of core leadership has resulted in repeated confusion in direction and significant delays in the overall project schedule.The current Early Access version also falls short in terms of content volume.We are deeply disappointed by the former leadership’s conduct, and above all, we feel a profound sense of betrayal by their failure to honor the trust placed in them by our fans.KRAFTON’s Full Support for the Dedicated Development Team\nTo uphold our commitment to provide you with the best possible gaming experience, we made the difficult yet necessary decision to change the executive leadership. Subnautica 2 has been and continues to be actively developed by a dedicated core team who share genuine passion, accountability, and commitment to the game. We deeply respect their expertise and creativity and will continue to provide full and unwavering support, enabling them to focus solely on delivering the exceptional game you deserve.KRAFTON’s Commitment to its Promises in Rewarding Employees\nAdditionally, KRAFTON has committed to fair and equitable compensation for all remaining Unknown Worlds employees who have continuously and tirelessly contributed to Subnautica 2’s development. We believe that the dedication and effort of this team are at the very heart of Subnautica’s ongoing evolution, and we reaffirm our commitment to provide the rewards they were promised.Fans will always remain at the center of every decision we make at KRAFTON. Moving forward, we promise transparent communication and continued efforts to sustainably develop and expand the beloved Subnautica universe.Honoring your trust and expectations is a core tenet at KRAFTON. We are committed to repaying your patience with an even more refined and exceptional gaming experience.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/subnautica-2s-early-access-release-delayed-to-2026-amid-developer-drama-123042406.html?src=rss",

Another limitation at play is that Mockly is mostly reproducing what conversations on these platforms would look like on the web, and not on mobile. Maybe it’s for the best if Mockly’s fake message generator is not 100% perfect. People still can and will be duped by fake message screenshots. But it is widely known that it’s possible to fake an image of a DM conversation, and people on social media are mostly primed to question the legitimacy of a DM screenshot.

One thing is for sure, though: you won't have to spend hundreds of dollars to get good tech this time around. Right now, you can grab a pair of Anker Soundcore Space wireless earbuds for only $45, which is the best price we've seen. That's nearly half off their normal price, too, and they're still in stock right now.\nThe Anker Soundcore Space earbuds are currently our top pick for best budget wireless earbuds. While their performance doesn’t rival that of more premium products, we felt the Space A40’s feature set offered excellent value for such a budget-friendly set of earbuds. \n\n\nThese earbuds connect via Bluetooth, support connection to two devices at once, and come in a case that supports wireless charging. We were most impressed with the Space A40’s active noise cancellation (ANC), a feature rarely seen at this price point. While it’s not the most sophisticated ANC on the market, it does its job in blocking out the steady rumble of a train or jet engine. Battery life is solid for a budget pair of earbuds, reaching roughly eight to 10 hours depending on use, with another 40 hours or so supplied by the case.\nIn-ear fit is comfortable, as the round earpieces are pretty light and evenly balanced. The audio quality is impressive for its price point, offering a warm sound that can be fine-tuned with an EQ in the Soundcore app. A subpar built-in mic means the Space A40s don’t have the best transparency mode and aren’t the best for phone calls in noisy areas, but overall for $45 these are a great deal.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/our-favorite-budget-wireless-earbuds-are-still-available-and-nearly-half-off-for-prime-day-145248189.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Amazon Prime Day is always a good time to buy a camera as it helps make a major purchase far more palatable. If you've been looking to upgrade your current equipment or get one as a gift, there are a large number of stellar deals available.\nMany of those deals come from the major brands including Sony, Canon, DJI, GoPro and Fujifilm — including some pulled straight from from our most recent camera guide. You may want to peruse that post for more info as you add items to your cart. With all that said, here are the best Prime Day camera deals we could find for day three of the sale.. \nBest Prime Day camera deals\n\n\nCanon EOS R100 with RT-S18-45mm lens for $549 (15 percent off): Canon's EOS R100 is the only modern mirrorless camera you can get with a kit lens for under $600. It comes with a 24-megapixel APS-C sensor that delivers great picture quality with Canon's pleasing skin tones.\nCanon EOS R50 with RF-S18-45mm lens for $749 (15 percent off): Canon's 24-megapixel APS-C EOS R50 is great for travel, parties, street photography and more thanks to the portable size and built-in flash. It offers nice image quality with warm, human friendly photos and is capable for creators as well with 4K 30fps supersampled video, with 10-bit and HDR capability.\nOM System OM-5 for $899 (25 percent off): For creators on a budget, the 20-megapixel, Micro Four Thirds OM-5 from OM System (formerly Olympic) is a great option at this price. It lets you shoot 4K video and 20MP stills at up to 10 fps. The design is nice with a full complement of manual controls, a fully articulating display and 7.5 stops of built-in stabilization.\nPanasonic Lumix S9 for $1,298 (13 percent off): The S9 may be Panasonic's smallest full-frame camera but it comes with the same 24MP sensor and similar video features to the popular S5 II. To that end, it offers up to 6.2K video, in-body stabilization and reliable autofocus. The key feature though is a special LUT button that lets you easily choose a custom cinematic look designed by professional creators.\nCanon EOS R6 Mark II for $1,899 (5 percent off): Canon's R6 Mark II offers a great mix of video and photography features. You can now shoot RAW stills at up to 40 fps and video specs are equally solid with sharp full-sensor 4K at up to 60 fps. It comes with in-body stabilization that's great for video and photos and autofocus is quicker and more versatile than ever.\nNikon Z6 III for $2,197 (12 percent off): Nikon's Z6 III is the best hybrid mirrorless camera for the money, thanks to the incredible performance of the 24-megapixel partially stacked sensor. You can shoot RAW bursts at up to 20 fps in electronic shutter mode while nailing sharp shots thanks to the much-improved autofocus. On the video side, it supports 6K RAW at up to 60 fps, or 4K 120p. All of that makes it ideal for creators and photographers alike, with the only drawback being the reduced resolution. \nSony A7 IV for $2,198 (19 percent off): It beats many rivals with 33 megapixels of resolution rather than 24, with image quality much improved overall. Video is now up to par with rivals with 4K at up to 60p with 10 bit 4:2:2 quality. Autofocus is incredible for both video and stills, and the in-body stabilization does a good job. The biggest drawback is rolling shutter that limits the use of the electronic shutter.\nCanon EOS R5 Mark II for $3,999 ($300 off): It's company’s best camera in years thanks to improvements in areas like autofocus and video. It comes with a high-resolution 45-megapixel stacked sensor, but still lets you shoot blackout-free bursts at up to 30 fps — and most of the shots will be sharp thanks to the updated autofocus with AI tracking. Video is also strong with up to 8K 60p RAW and 4K 120 fps shooting. \nBest Prime Day action cam and drone deals\n\n\nDJI Osmo Action 4 for $209 (30 percent off): DJI's Osmo Action 4 is a tremendous deal at this price, as you're not giving up much in comparison to the most recent model, the Action 5. It has the same big 1/1.3-inch sensor that delivers excellent video quality, especially in low light. It also features a D-LogM profile to boost dynamic range, DJI's excellent clip-on mount and high-quality 4K 120p video.\nDJI Osmo Mobile 7P gimbal for $125 (15 percent off): This three-axis gimbal keeps your smartphone video as smooth as can be with DJI's ActiveTrack 7.0, and includes a magnetic snapping mechanism so you can install your mobile device in seconds. The latest feature is native tracking that follows you around, thanks to the included Multifunctional Module. \nDJI Mini 4K drone for $309 (21 percent off): The Mini 4 weighs less than 249 grams so it doesn't require a permit, but can still shoot 4K video at up to 30 fps or 2.7K at 60 fps with three-axis stabilization. It can fly up to 31 minutes on a charge and has one-tap movements like dronie, helix and panoramic shooting.\nGoPro Hero 13 Black for $329 (23 percent off): GoPro’s Hero 13 Black is now available with a new family of modular lenses called the HB series (ultra-wide, anamorphic and macro), making it far more versatile for action creators. It also has a slightly bigger battery that allows longer capture times, up to 90 minutes for 4K 30fps video. Other specs remain the same, including up to 5.3K at 60fps in 10-bit color, along with the excellent Hypersmooth stabilization. \nInsta360 X4 for $349 (30 percent): Insta360 simply dominates the 360-degree category, thanks to its ability to capture action at up to 8K 30fps or 5.7K at 60fps — providing more detail when you reframe it to 16:9. At the same time, the Me Mode that produces flat video (with automatic selfie stick removal) has been upgraded from a maximum 2.7K 30fps to 4K 30fps. It also offers solid battery life, waterproofing to 10m and a free editing app. \nBest Prime Day deals on camera accessories\n\n\nK&F Concept 25L backpack for $50 (17 percent off): A large 25L three-tiered camera bag that can hold multiple cameras, lenses and drones. It has quick side access and features durable materials with a rain cover, making it great for outdoor travel, weddings or vlogging.\nLexar 256GB Professional Silver Pro V60 memory card for $51 (32 percent off): An excellent compromise between speed and value with up to 280MB/s read and 160MB/s write speeds. \nSmallRig 71-inch Camera Tripod with 360 ball head for $56 (20 percent off): Two-in-one tripod monopod with a head that adjusts 360 degrees so you can take photos at any angle horizontally or vertically. \nElgato Key Light 2800 lumens for $140 (22 percent off): For presentations or simple studio shoots, you get a silent, low-heat studio light with high output and a 2900-7000K temperature range. It's controllable by WiFi and has an opal glass face for glare-free diffusion. \nElgato Prompter for $190 (37 percent off): Whether you're a creator on YouTube or present on Zoom, the Elgato Prompter is an elegant and popular choice thanks to the built-in display that allows you to read scripts while looking at the camera. Support more cameras than ever, even with wide lenses and features an easy setup. \nExpired deals\nDJI Neo drone for $159 (20 percent off): The DJI Neo may be an inexpensive, beginner-friendly drone, but has powerful features like subject tracking and quick shots. It can shoot video at up to 4K 30 fps and is quick and maneuverable, though it's also fairly loud. You can also grab one with three batteries and a charger for $229 (21 percent off).This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cameras/the-best-amazon-prime-day-camera-deals-you-can-still-get-right-now-104502326.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "It’s nice to see Samsung offer something new for 2025. For the last few years, the company has been updating existing designs for its annual refreshes, especially its most premium soundbar, the Q990. I was pleasantly surprised to see something entirely new when the company debuted the QS700F ($700) at CES. This model doesn’t have the immersive sound that its more expensive sibling offers, but there are several handy features, including the ability to adapt to whichever way you place it.\nFor all of its might, the QS700F only beams Dolby Atmos in a 3.1.2-channel speaker configuration. Eight total drivers provide the sound here, significantly less than what blasts the 11.1.4-channel sound on the all-in-one Q990F. But the QS700F costs half as much, and for people who live in smaller spaces or have smaller living rooms, this more affordable, adaptable model will serve you just fine. \n\n\nDesign\nWith the QS700F, Samsung nixed the extra angles from the Q990F since there are no side-firing drivers here. This gives the soundbar a simplified, brick-like rectangular shape that’s less of a distraction in front of your TV. The QS700F is also shorter when laid horizontally on a table or mantle, which means it doesn’t block your TV.\nAround the sides and back, Samsung opted to use a rigid, circularly perforated speaker grille that wraps the entire surface. Up top, there’s a more refined, horizontal cover that gives the soundbar a more sophisticated look. It also means that you’ll be getting the speaker’s best-looking side when you flip and rotate it to mount it on a wall. While the included wireless subwoofer won’t win any design awards, it’s a compact unit at just under 10 inches square.\nTo keep the look clean, Samsung put its logo on the side rather than on the front. It also kept the onboard controls simple, which is important since they’re prominently displayed if the soundbar is wall mounted. The buttons are basic icons for source, volume and power, colored so they blend in nicely even when they’re in plain sight. Around back, you’ll find the wired connections: an HDMI input (eARC), one HDMI output and an optical port.\nLike most soundbars, the QS700F features some LEDs on the front as a visual cue when you’re adjusting volume or making other tweaks. However, when you raise or lower the volume, there’s a mini light show that’s obnoxious. A single blinking LED for each time you press a button would suffice. There’s also an LED that blinks when the soundbar is muted, which I also think is a step too much. You might think you can avoid seeing these if you use the soundbar in its other orientation, but I regret to inform you that there’s another set of LEDs on the top that appear if the QS700F is wall-mounted.\nSoftware and features\n\n\n\n\n  Billy Steele for Engadget\n \n\nThere are a number of features to discuss on the QS700F, but the most important one is called Convertible Fit. The soundbar has an accelerometer inside that detects whether you’ve placed the speaker flat or if you’ve mounted it on a wall. It will then automatically adjust which drivers the front- and up-firing channels are coming from. The positioning of the drivers inside ensures that up-firing units are angled correctly and beaming sound out into the room in both positions. Convertible Fit works really well, and I couldn’t tell a huge difference in audio quality between the two orientations. It sounded like the center channel (vocals and dialog) was slightly louder in the wall-mount position, but it wasn’t too much of a distraction.\nOther notable tools include wireless Dolby Atmos with compatible TVs and Wi-Fi connectivity powers AirPlay, Chromecast, Spotify Connect, Roon Service and Tidal Connect. Interestingly, the QS700F doesn’t work with Samsung’s virtual assistant Bixby for voice controls. Instead, you’ll employ Google Assistant through Google Home for that purpose.\nThen there are the handy features that require a Samsung TV, which you’ll need to consider since they’re major functions of the soundbar. First up is Samsung’s Q-Symphony tech, which allows you to use TV speakers in unison with the soundbar. The company says this produces “more robust and nuanced sound,” and that it can also enhance clarity with certain models of its AI-equipped TVs. As I don’t have a Samsung TV, I wasn’t able to test this, but I don’t see how more speakers could ever be a bad thing.\nYou can only use Samsung’s SpaceFit Sound Pro room calibration if you have one of its TVs with a built-in microphone. The QS700F doesn’t have a mic for this purpose, so you’ll have to settle for the stock tuning if you don’t own one of the required displays. You’ll also miss out on Active Voice Amplifier Pro as this model doesn’t support the more robust dialog adjustment. There is a Voice Enhance Mode on the QS700F, but it’s not as powerful. Hoping to use wireless Dolby Atmos? It’ll only work with 2022-2025 Samsung TVs — making it yet another company-exclusive feature.\nOne more place the QS700F falls behind Samsung’s flagship Q990F soundbar is video passthrough. The latter offers 4K at 120Hz while the QS700F only manages 4K at 60Hz. I realize this won’t matter for a lot of people, but for gamers and movie buffs, this will be disappointing.\nLike other recent Samsung soundbars, the QS700F can be controlled via the SmartThings app. It contains all kinds of presets, settings and other options, including the ability to adjust channel output, fine-tune audio sync and switch inputs. Since most of what you’ll do here pertains to audio performance, I’ll discuss the app more later.\nSound quality\n\n\n\n\n  Billy Steele for Engadget\n \n\nThe QS700F offers 3.1.2-channel audio with support for Dolby Atmos and DTS Virtual:X. Thanks to the up-firing drivers, this is true Atmos sound, unlike on some soundbars that only offer a virtualized version of the immersive audio. Across eight speakers in the soundbar, the QS700F has three main channels and two up-firing channels. And, of course, the “1” in the middle is the wireless subwoofer.\nOverall, sound from the QS700F is crisp and clear, providing ample detail for movies and music alike. Despite the smaller package, the compact sub still produces plenty of booming bass, so there’s lots of thunder for action scenes in Top Gun: Maverick. The soundbar also capably handled all of the directional audio in Formula 1: Drive to Survive. I did notice that the overall sense of immersion wasn’t as high as the Sonos Arc Ultra I just moved out to install the QS700F. That’s not really surprising, but it did highlight the limits of 3.1.2-channel soundbars. They’re good enough for smaller spaces with four right angles, but taller ceilings and irregular rooms really need more channels and rear speakers.\nIn music, vocals are prominent through the center channels, and for some listeners, they may be overly so. You can adjust this in the app, but I didn’t mind it. Highs, mids and lows are all appropriately present, with the subwoofer bumping along when a song calls for it. If you’re hoping the QS700F can serve as your music setup in addition to boosting TV audio, you’ll be well served by the soundbar. And as I already mentioned, it supports a variety of methods for beaming tunes from your phone without having to get off the couch.\nThere are a number of sound modes to help you find the right tuning for your content. Those include Surround, Game Pro, Adaptive, DTS Virtual:X and Standard. I found Adaptive to be best suited for all-around use since it automatically adjusts the audio based on the content being played. And unless you really want to mess around with the settings on a regular basis, Adaptive allows you to “set it and forget it” while still letting the QS700F’s sonic prowess shine.\nIn the “Advanced Sound Settings,” there are options for voice and bass enhancement as well as the handy Night Mode that makes low frequencies less boomy when someone in your home is sleeping. There are also settings for Moderate Bass, which delivers “deep, rich bass sound,” and Virtual that simulates a wider soundstage in the absence of rear speakers. You can clearly hear that the presets and modes all change the audio to some degree when enabled, so their utility will likely depend on when and where you’re using the QS700F.\nThe competition\n\n\n\n  Sonos Beam (Gen 2)\n \n\n  Devindra Hardawar for Engadget\n \n\nSamsung and Sony both have new 3.1.2-channel Dolby Atmos soundbars for 2025. Of course, Sony’s Theater Bar 6 doesn’t do the neat orientation trick that the QS700F does, but there is still a number of direct similarities between the two. They both come with a subwoofer in the box and offer various sound modes. Dolby Atmos and DTS:X audio on the Bar 6 is greatly aided by up-firing speakers and Sony’s virtual surround sound tech. And like Samsung, there are certain features that require one of the company’s TVs — like the AI-powered Voice Zoom 3 dialog boost. At $650, Sony’s soundbar won’t save you much over the QS700F at full price.\nLet’s not forget about Sonos. The second-gen Beam is the closest thing to the QS700F in the company’s lineup, but there are some caveats. The Beam doesn’t have up-firing speakers, so the Atmos sound is entirely virtualized, and you can tell the difference. You do get the benefit of TV Audio Swap with the Ace headphones, but you have to contend with the ongoing battle that is Sonos’ app overhaul. The newer Beam is cheaper at $499, but adding a subwoofer that you’ll most certainly want costs another $429 (Sub Mini) or $700 (Sub 4). That add-on makes this option much pricier than the QS700F.\nWrap-up\nThe QS700F is a breath of fresh air in Samsung’s home theater lineup, offering something new when it’s flagship Q990 model only got a modest refresh. Sure, some of the handiest features require one of the company’s TVs, but that’s how Samsung and some of the competition have operated for years now. The biggest item you’ll miss out on there is room calibration, especially if you plan to use the QS700F in a space with high ceilings or lots of angles.\nCaveats aside, the best thing about the soundbar is its automatic orientation adjustment. This gives you a second option for installation down the road if your TV and/or its location change before you’re ready to upgrade your audio setup. The QS700F is easy on the eyes too, which isn’t always the case with these devices. So, in the end, the combination of features, design and audio performance make this soundbar a worthy contender at the top end of the midrange, if you’re willing to live with the limitations of Dolby Atmos in 3.1.2.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/samsung-hw-qs700f-soundbar-review-sophisticated-design-automatic-adjustments-180035549.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Prime Day is basically Black Friday for Amazon’s own devices. For almost as long as the shopping event has taken place (it started in July 2015, if you forgot), it’s been one of the most reliable days of the year to snag Amazon gadgets like Kindles Echo speakers and Fire tablets at dirt-cheap prices. Amazon has regular sales all the time, but if you still shell out $139 annually for Prime, it’s in your best interest to wait until mid-July to grab gear that Amazon makes itself. That’s still accurate this year, too — for the most part.\nBut not for the Echo Dot. Yes, it’s on sale this year for $32. But that discounted price offends me personally — and it should offend you, too. The humble little orb of a smart speaker got the short end of the stick for Prime Day 2025. For reference, the latest edition of the Echo Dot was $23 last July Prime Day, and $23 again during the Black Friday period in 2024.\nWhile a $9 difference may not seem like much, it’s a slap in the face for Prime subscribers who have come to expect the exclusive deals available to them during this arbitrary shopping event to be just as much of a perk of their membership as access to Prime Video, free two-day delivery and the like. It’s worse that Amazon devices are the usual suspects when it comes to Hella Good Deals on Prime Day. If the Prime Day deal on the Echo Dot sucks, that means we can’t reliably expect any of Amazon’s devices to be down to record-low prices during this event.\nThis, of course, matters not one bit to Amazon. Why the company decided to punish would-be Echo Dot purchasers this time around and not Kindle or Fire TV buyers will likely remain a mystery to us. But considering the uncertainty surrounding tariffs in the US and the steady flow of rising prices on tech as a direct result of that, one theory I have is that Amazon is testing its customers.\nIf Engadget's historical Prime Day data is anything to go on, the Echo Dot is an extremely popular purchase — and Amazon likely knows that. If enough customers OK this objectively bad deal by purchasing the Echo Dot at $32 a pop, that signals to Amazon that it can continue to offer bad discounts on its devices without repercussions. I hesitate to say the days of a $23 Echo Dot are totally behind us, but they could be depending on how things go this summer.\nThat said, the best alternative to the Echo Dot this Prime Day is the Echo Spot for $45. Amazon revived that smart alarm clock last year and, while I don’t think it will boot the Echo Dot out of the speaker lineup any time soon, there’s an argument for such a replacement considering Amazon now also has the ultra-cheap Echo Pop. Regardless, if you were hoping to buy an Echo Dot on discount during Prime Day, I recommend skipping it and opting for the Spot or the Pop instead.\nIn addition, here are some Prime Day deals that are actually worth your time and money that all come in at $32 or less:\n\nThis $23 handheld fan that has already saved me from melting this year in the New York City summer heat.\nThe $18 Amazon Fire TV Stick HD that we recently named our favorite budget streaming device.\nA $16 Samsung Galaxy SmartTag 2, a favorite Bluetooth tracker of ours if you're a Samsung fan but also have a habit of losing things like your wallet or keys.\nA $20 AirTag, if you're also prone to losing things but identify as an iOS stan.\nThis $14 Anker wireless charging stand that's super basic, gets the job done and lets you power up your phone in either portrait or landscape mode.\nThis $19 Soundcore speaker that's a little larger than palm-sized and sounds pretty decent for its size.\nThese $22 Kasa smart bulbs that are hard to beat if you're looking for no-brainer IoT devices to start your smart home ecosystem.\nThis $13 Anker USB-C charging adapter because, if you're like me, you need to have one of these in basically every room so you can always charge your phone.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/you-definitely-should-not-buy-an-echo-dot-this-prime-day-113023104.html?src=rss",

New data from market intelligence provider Similarweb released this week indicates Threads is nearing X’s daily app users on mobile. Overall, X is still larger than Threads thanks to its more prominent web presence. X also has other advantages, which could make for an interesting fight between the tech giants. But Threads can’t be counted out yet, simply because X is larger. Though Threads may have fewer daily active users than X, it’s been seeing stronger growth.

    "summary": "If you're looking to keep an eye on your home, whether you're away for the weekend or just tucked into bed, a good security camera can give you peace of mind. The best security camera setups in 2025 do a lot more than just record footage — they offer smart alerts, crystal-clear video, night vision, two-way talk and seamless integration with other smart home gear.These days you can find security cameras for almost every need: indoor cameras to check in on pets, floodlight cams that light up your driveway or battery-powered outdoor options that can go just about anywhere. Whether you're building out a whole-home system or just want one reliable camera to start, we've rounded up the top picks that offer great performance, helpful features and easy app controls.\nTable of contents \n\nBest security cameras for 2025\nWhat to look for in a security camera\nOther security cameras we tested\nSecurity camera FAQs\n\nBest security cameras for 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat to look for in a security camera\nHardware and design\nOne of the first things you’ll want to consider before buying a home security camera is where you intend to put it. Do you want an outdoor or indoor setup, or cameras that can work in both environments? That’s the first decision to make, since not all cameras are designed to be weatherproof. Next, consider where those cameras will live: do you need ones that can easily mount to the side of your home or above your garage? Do you want cameras in every room of your house, installed up in a ceiling corner out of reach? Should those cameras be able to swivel and turn on their own to track subjects or give you a wider field of view? If you just want to see packages on your porch or who's coming to the door, a doorbell camera might be a better option.  \nCheck the specifications for the cameras you’re considering to see if they come with any mounting hardware in the box, or if you’ll need special attachments to get the capabilities you want. For example, an extra feature like solar power for outdoor security cameras typically requires buying the solar panel separately, or buying a configuration of the camera that includes the panel in the box.\nAnother hardware component to consider is the proper connection for local storage. Many home security cameras give you the option to save footage locally by connecting a thumb drive or a microSD card either to the camera itself or to its base station. If you don’t intend on using cloud storage (which typically comes with a subscription cost), choosing a surveillance camera system that allows for local storage will be key.\nBattery life\nBattery life considerations will only apply to wireless cameras, so you’ll want to make note of the expected battery life of any wire-free camera you’re considering. For most that use rechargeable lithium-ion batteries, it will come down to how “busy” the camera will be on a regular basis recording video. Some could estimate a minimum battery life of a couple weeks to one month with high usage, but you could get even more than that if the camera is in a low-traffic area.\nI personally think you should be getting at least three weeks of battery life out of any rechargeable-battery security camera — anything less and it becomes a hassle just to keep the device in working order. Also, be prepared to access your cameras (including those mounted in high places) whenever you need to recharge their batteries. Scant few options today (looking at you, Blink), run on AA or AAA batteries, and those tend to last up to two years before you need to replace them.\nAudiovisual features\nNearly every security camera can send you a notification when it detects motion. Most also offer more sophisticated alerts, like person, package, pet and vehicle detection, though those sometimes require a subscription. You can decide under which conditions you’d like to be alerted as well. Many cameras will let you set location preferences, using your phone to discern where you are, so you’re only alerted when you’re away. Some can then be programmed to turn off completely when you’re home, or you can decide to keep the camera recording without alerting you of activity. Systems without location tracking can be armed on a schedule or manually turned on and off.\nAlmost every security camera can listen as well as see — some can send you an alert when specific sounds are detected, such as breaking glass, barking dogs or fire alarms. Those microphones also let you hear what’s going on in the room, while built-in speakers allow for two-way conversations.\nIf viewing events at night is important to you, you’ll want to consider a camera’s ability to see in the dark. Most use infrared LEDs to detect motion and record events after the sun goes down. Infrared will work in total darkness, but can only produce a black and white image. A few cameras can capture color video at night through a combination of larger sensors and onboard image processing, but they won’t work in total darkness. A couple of the options we tried were spotlight cams with an onboard light you can manually turn on to light up a space for a better picture. Floodlight cameras are another option for outdoor models, which shine a bright light when motion is detected which may act as a deterrence.  \nSubscription features\nWithout exception, every camera we tested has an optional subscription component. These typically run between $3 and $15 per month, though some offer a discount if you pay for a year up front. Advanced (and sometimes basic) features are paywalled behind these subs, so if you’re looking for things like person detection, extended live feeds, cloud storage, event labeling and longer event history, you’ll want to check whether you get those for free or only if you pay up.\nCloud storage for video clips beyond a day or so is the most common subscription-only feature, but some cameras have the option of using local storage with a microSD card or flash drive. Cameras that work with Apple’s HomeKit will usually let you store clips using your iCloud+ plan, so you might not need a separate subscription for those. To help make sense of whether you need to pay for a plan or not, we detail the monthly prices and membership features for each pick below so you can gauge the full cost of the level of monitoring you want.\nPrivacy settings\nThe majority of security cameras use cloud storage for clips. Even those that store your footage locally on SD cards or USB drives are still considered Wi-Fi cameras, connecting to the world at large through your home internet. Anything that’s in communication with other networks has the potential to be accessed by bad actors. Manufacturers take measures such as encrypting video before it’s sent to the cloud and requiring two-factor authentication to sign into any account to make systems safer. Users can go one step further by regularly installing security updates and making sure the passwords they use are strong and not reused elsewhere.\nAs for keeping your personal activity private, all cameras have a disarm feature, but some can automatically turn off when you are home if you share your location. Others will also let you set privacy zones and won’t capture footage or send alerts for movements in designated areas. That could be a part of the house you don’t want recorded or, for outdoor coverage, parts of your neighbor’s yard or driveway.\nAll the units we tested have indicator lights that turn on when a live view is being accessed or recording is taking place. But you’ll have to check what your particular camera’s LEDs mean, as nearly every one is different. Recording in progress is sometimes indicated with a red light, sometimes that light is blue, and on other cameras, it’s green. Some security cameras let you disable the recording light too, if you don’t want to alert would-be intruders that you’re watching them.\nCompatibility\nIf this is your first foray into smart home gear, you just need to ensure that the camera you buy will work with your phone — and all of our top picks here have apps that work with both iOS and Android. If you already have TVs, smart monitors, home hubs, doorbells and other smart devices, check that what you buy now will work with what you already have if you want the most seamless system.\nWe’ve listed which of the three major smart home ecosystems each of our picks will work with, but in general, Amazon Alexa has the widest compatibility with third party brands, followed by Google. Apple’s HomeKit has a smaller number of compatible cameras on the market, but the list is still sizable enough and includes well-regarded brands like Ecobee, Logitech and Aqara, so you’ll likely be able to find one with the features you want.\nOther security cameras we tested\nLogitech Circle View Apple HomeKit-Enabled\nWe called out the Logitech Circle View camera as a HomeKit-enabled alternative to our top Siri pick, the Ecobee cam but it’s worth mentioning its merits once more. The Circle View works well with Apple’s smart home system and connected easily with my HomePod. Like with Ecobee, you may not need to pay for an additional subscription for cloud storage if you already have an iCloud+ plan. The video captured is warm and sharp. But it’s pricier than Ecobee’s HomeKit option and the web cam-aesthetic isn’t particularly elegant.\nRoku Indoor Security Camera\nWhile we don’t love that the Roku Indoor Security Camera uses a micro USB connection, the unit itself has a solid build. It can spin in either direction to track movement, either automatically or manually through the app. It’s easy to set up and is remarkably affordable. A subscription is required for clip storage and event filtering. Without it, the camera will only store stills from detection events, though you can easily manually save clips to your photos library from within the app. The color night vision is surprisingly clear, and the daytime recordings are bright and sharp. While other cameras we tested simply offered more features and better apps, this could be a compelling budget pick.\nAqara 2K Hub G3\nIf you ask a seven-year-old which camera is best (and we did) they will tell you it’s the Aqara 2K Hub G3, thanks to the unit’s cute little ears. We tested it with its own app, which worked well, and with HomeKit, which unfortunately kept disconnecting throughout our testing. The camera was easy and quick to set up thanks to the dual-bank Wi-Fi connection. We also appreciated the privacy setting that physically angled the camera lens down inside the unit (revealing a pair of shut-eye images that added to the adorableness). If you’re considering getting other Aqara smart home devices, and will primarily use the Aqara app, the Hub H3 is a good buy as it acts as the required hub for other devices from the brand.\nRing Indoor Cam (wired)\nThe Blink camera was simply a better value than the Ring Indoor Cam. The Ring unit felt overly lightweight and insubstantial, to the point where its own cable caused it to fall over. Set up was a little fussy and many of the available features are reserved for paid subscriptions. But the app helpfully leads you through setup and walks you through the various features, making it good for beginners. You’re also automatically opted into the Ring Neighbors app which is a fascinating glimpse into your neighborhood’s porch piracy events, lost cats, wild animal sightings and missing binky alerts.\nRing Outdoor Cam (Stick Up Cam, wireless)\nSimilarly to the Indoor Cam, the Ring Outdoor Cam was easy to set up and could be a decent option for beginners. Previously known as the Stick Up Cam, this model is wireless and rechargeable, but our biggest gripe with it is that it powers up via microUSB. USB-C is the standard now, so we recommend only buying new tech that supports the latest standard whenever possible. It’s worth noting that the new Ring Outdoor Cam Plus also charges via microUSB, so it seems Ring faithfuls may be stuck with old tech for a while longer.\nSecurity camera FAQs\nIs it better to have wired or wireless security cameras?\nWired security cameras are hardwired directly to the system’s local video storage, such as a digital video recorder (DVR) or a network video recorder (NVR) connected via Ethernet cables. That makes it more secure and not subject to the whims of Wi-Fi connections. But running the power and Ethernet cables to the camera require more intensive installation, possibly requiring a professional. Wireless cameras or plug-in cameras give you more flexibility in the installation process and location. Though a local, wired connection is less susceptible to remote hacking, most current wireless cameras implement fairly strong security measures — but you’ll still want to make sure you choose complex passwords and turn on safety measures like two-factor authentication.\nWhat do security camera subscriptions look like?\nSubscriptions for security cameras usually run between $3 and $15 per month, though you can often get a discount if you pay for a year of service up-front. They give you access to advanced (and sometimes basic) features such as person detection, cloud storage, live feeds and intelligent labelling of events.\nWhat security system does not require a monthly fee?\nExcluding cameras from home security system companies like ADT and Slomins, nearly all DIY security cameras will work on a basic level without a subscription, meaning you can usually get motion-triggered alerts and the ability to see at least a short history of recorded action. Some cameras, such as the Blink Mini, offer no cloud storage without a subscription, but you can still see a live feed and you can opt for local footage storage with additional equipment.\nHow do you install a security camera?\nInstalling a security camera can be as simple as setting it on a table, plugging it in and using the app to connect to your home’s Wi-Fi. Indoor cameras often come with user-installable wall mounts as well. Wireless outdoor security cameras are sometimes battery-operated, so you don’t need to install them near an outlet and they often come with mounting brackets for attaching them to outdoor surfaces. Larger security systems with hardwired cameras may require professional installation.\nDo security cameras record sound?\nEvery security camera we tested records sound as well as video. You can turn sound recording on or off at your leisure.\nDo security cameras work with existing surveillance systems?\nSome do. The easiest way to ensure that your camera will work with your other surveillance equipment is to get devices from the same brand.\nDo wireless security cameras work without Wi-Fi?\nMost wireless home security cameras connect via Wi-Fi. However, some cameras have the option of connecting through a cellular data plan. Of course, there’s an additional cost for such connectivity, but it allows the cameras to record if the Wi-Fi goes out or if a camera is too far from home to get a signal from the router.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/best-security-camera-130035012.html?src=rss",
    "full_text": "The company’s omnipresence may be alarming in its scope, but it certainly makes signing up for stuff easier. I was happy to find a camera that could work happily with two of the three major platforms. The Altas PT Ultra is one of Reolink’s newest battery-powered security cameras and it really shines in that department. There are also handy quick controls on the main page for each camera that let you take photos and record snippets of video to be saved immediately. Reolink (unsurprisingly) has a cloud subscription plan that you can use to save videos, but the tiers and pricing are unclear. Those microphones also let you hear what’s going on in the room, while built-in speakers allow for two-way conversations. Anything that’s in communication with other networks has the potential to be accessed by bad actors.

    "summary": "AI-generated child sexual abuse material (CSAM) has been flooding the internet, according to a report by The New York Times. Researchers at organizations like the Internet Watch Foundation and the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children are warning that this new AI-created CSAM is nearly indistinguishable from the real thing.\nLet's go over some numbers. The Internet Watch Foundation, a nonprofit that investigates and collects reports of CSAM, has identified 1,286 AI-generated videos so far this year. This is compared with just two videos identified in the first half of 2024. That's an exponential increase.\n🔎 Developments in artificial intelligence (AI) come with a range of benefits, including supporting learning and innovation. There is, however, growing concern for how AI can also be misused to create and share child sexual abuse material (CSAM), referred to as AI-CSAM.In… pic.twitter.com/lgfRQNBk8N— Internet Watch Foundation (IWF) (@IWFhotline) July 8, 2025\n\nThe National Center for Missing & Exploited Children re-affirms those statistics. It told NYT that it has received 485,000 reports of AI-generated CSAM, including still images and videos, in the first half of 2025. This is compared to 67,000 for all of 2024. That's another massive uptick\n“It’s a canary in the coal mine,” said Derek Ray-Hill, interim chief executive of the Internet Watch Foundation. “There is an absolute tsunami we are seeing.”\nThis technology is constantly improving, so the videos and images have become more realistic. The Internet Watch Foundation found an internet forum in which users were praising how realistic the new videos were. Reporting suggests that this content is distributed through the dark web, making it harder for law enforcement agencies to identify the offenders.\nIt's worth remembering how AI image generators work. They are trained using real images and videos. The New York Times says that much of this new glut of AI-generated content includes real CSAM that has been repurposed by the algorithm. Some of the material even uses real photos of children scraped from school websites and social media.\nThe issue dates back to the early days of this technology. In 2023, researchers at the Stanford Internet Observatory found hundreds of examples of CSAM in a data set used in an early version of the image generator Stable Diffusion. Stability AI says it has introduced safeguards to improve safety standards and \"is deeply committed to preventing the misuse of our technology, particularly in the creation and dissemination of harmful content, including CSAM.\"\nThat did lead other companies to start reporting AI-generated CSAM to the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children. Amazon reported a whopping 380,000 instances of AI-generated CSAM in the first half of this year, all of which it took down. OpenAI reported 75,000 cases.\nNCMEC Applauds the California State Legislature for Passing AB 1831 and looks forward to it being signed into law.  NCMEC supports AB 1831 because it addresses gaps in California’s legal remedies for child victims of Generative AI CSAM. We are heartened to see states move… pic.twitter.com/qZt1mgD7Eo— National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (@NCMEC) September 4, 2024\n\nCourts have been slow to catch up with this tech. The DOJ made its first known arrest last year of a man suspected of possessing and distributing AI-generated CSAM. A UK man recently got 18 months in jail for using AI to generate the foul images, which he sold.\n“The Department of Justice views all forms of AI-generated CSAM as a serious and emerging threat,” Matt Galeotti, head of the Justice Department’s criminal division, told NYT.\nIt's worth noting that despite the alarming uptick in occurrences, AI-generated content still represents a mere fraction of all CSAM identified by authorities and watchdog organizations. For instance, the Internet Watch Foundation confirmed 291,273 reports of CSAM in 2024 and, as previously noted, just two instances were AI-generated.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/reports-indicate-a-massive-uptick-in-ai-generated-csam-throughout-the-internet-154937671.html?src=rss",

The Ninja Foodi Dual-Zone 10-quart air fryer is $70 off and down to $180.\nThis is not a record low price for this model.

In fact, it's our pick for the best dual-zone air fryer. It heats up quickly and runs quietly, but the real selling point here is the dual-basket setup. If you cook a lot or make meals for several people on a regular basis, the Ninja Foodi could be a game changer.\nIt's possible to use the two baskets to prepare entirely different foods at the same time with distinct cooking modes — you can't do that on a grill. You can also prepare food in both baskets in the same way with the Match Cook feature. \nA very useful feature called Smart Finish can adjust cooking times automatically so that the food in both baskets (perhaps you have a protein in one and vegetables in the other) will be ready at the same time.

    "full_text": "Nvidia seems determined to find a way to sell AI chips in China despite U.S. export restrictions. The semiconductor giant is planning to launch an AI chip specifically for the Chinese market as early as September, as originally reported by the Financial Times. This AI chip would be based on Nvidia’s Blackwell RTX Pro 6000 processor, which is already modified to meet the existing AI chip restrictions, the Financial Times added. These chips wouldn’t include high-bandwidth memory or NVLink, Nvidia’s high-speed but low-latency communication interface, both of which are features of the company’s advanced AI chips. Last month, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said the company would no longer include the Chinese market in its revenue and profit forecasts. Maybe that will be a short-lived change. Nvidia declined to comment on the news. An Nvidia spokesperson added, “With the current export controls, we are effectively out of the China datacenter market, which is now served only by competitors such as Huawei. China has one of the largest populations of developers in the world, creating open-source foundation models and non-military applications used globally. While security is paramount, every one of those applications should run best on the U.S. AI stack.”"

    "summary": "If you've been itching to invest in a robot vacuum to help you clean up around the house, you're in luck. Prime Day deals, like clockwork, have brought discounts to a bunch of our favorite robot vacuums and there are still plenty available now. One of the best deals is on this Shark AI Ultra robovac, which you can grab for 50 percent off — just $298.\nThis is a version of one of the top picks in our best robot vacuums guide. It boasts excellent suction power and a bagless, auto-empty base that's super convenient. Shark's mobile app is easy to use as well, allowing you to set cleaning schedules and see the home map the robot creates so you can select specific areas and rooms to clean. \n\n\nThe battery life is decent, at 120 minutes per charge. Like most modern robovacs, it'll head back to the power outlet on its own. During use, we found that the vacuum did a pretty good job at avoiding obstacles and managed to sidestep the many cat toys strewn across the floor.\nMany other Shark products are also on sale right now. This includes other robovacs, but also standard upright designs. Here are some of the highlights.\n\nShark AV2501S AI Ultra robot vacuum for $250 (55 percent off): A version of our favorite robot vacuum, this Shark machine has strong suction power and won't choke at the first sight of pet hair or big dust bunnies. Its self-emptying base is bagless as well, which means you won't have to buy propriety bags to refill it with over time. This auto-empty base has a 30-day capacity.\nShark PowerDetect NeverTouch Pro robot vacuum and mop for $700 (42 percent off): This Shark machine is one of our favorites in part because it truly lives up to its name. Thanks to its self-emptying dock that handles vacuumed debris along with clean and dirty mopping water, you really don't have to touch the thing for at least 30 days in between cleanings. We found it to be a solid autonomous dirt sucker, and its mopping capabilities are quite good to match.\nShark PowerDetect Clean & Empty cordless vacuum for $400 (33 percent off): Shark's cordless vacuums are just as good as their robot vacuums, and you can usually find them on sale for less than other major brands. This one has great suction power and a relatively lightweight design, but the fact that it comes with a self-emptying base makes it an ultra-convenient choice.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/shark-robot-vacuums-are-up-to-half-off-in-these-prime-day-deals-170023907.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Earlier this week, Grok, X's built-in chatbot, took a hard turn toward antisemitism following a recent update. Amid unprompted, hateful rhetoric against Jews, it even began referring to itself as MechaHitler, a reference to 1992's Wolfenstein 3D. X has been working to delete the chatbot's offensive posts. But it's safe to say many are left wondering how this sort of thing can even happen.\nI spoke to Solomon Messing, a research professor at New York University's Center for Social Media and Politics, to get a sense of what may have gone wrong with Grok. Before his current stint in academia, Messing worked in the tech industry, including at Twitter, where he founded the company's applied sciences research team. He was also there for the early stages of Elon Musk's takeover.\nThe first thing to understand about how chatbots like Grok work is that they're built on large language models (LLMs) designed to mimic natural language. LLMs are pretrained on giant swaths of text, including books, academic papers and, yes, even social media posts. The training process allows AI models to generate coherent text through a predictive algorithm. However, those predictive capabilities are only as good as the numerical values or \"weights\" that an AI algorithm learns to assign to the signals it's later asked to interpret. Through a process known as post-training, AI researchers can fine-tune the weights their models assign to input data, thereby changing the outputs they generate.\n\"If a model has seen content like this during pretraining, there's the potential for the model to mimic the style and substance of the worst offenders on the internet,\" said Messing.\nIn short, the pre-training data is where everything starts. If an AI model hasn’t seen hateful, anti-antisemitic content, it won’t be aware of the sorts of patterns that inform that kind of speech — including phrases such as \"Heil Hitler\"  —  and, as a result, it probably won't regurgitate them to the user.\nIn the statement X shared after the episode, the company admitted there were areas where Grok's training could be improved. \"We are aware of recent posts made by Grok and are actively working to remove the inappropriate posts. Since being made aware of the content, xAI has taken action to ban hate speech before Grok posts on X,\" the company said. \"xAI is training only truth-seeking and thanks to the millions of users on X, we are able to quickly identify and update the model where training could be improved.\"\nScreenshots via X\nAs I saw people post screenshots of Grok's responses, one thought I had was that what we were watching was a reflection of X's changing userbase. It's no secret xAI has been using data from X to train Grok; easier access to the platform's trove of information is part of the reason Musk said he was merging the two companies in March. What's more, X's userbase has become more right wing under Musk's ownership of the site. In effect, there may have been a poisoning of the well that is Grok's training data. Messing isn't so certain.\n\"Could the pre-training data for Grok be getting more hateful over time? Sure, if you remove content moderation over time, the userbase might get more and more oriented toward people who are tolerant of hateful speech [...]  thus the pre-training data drifts in a more hateful direction,\" Messing said. \"But without knowing what's in the training data, it's hard to say for sure.\"\nIt also wouldn't explain how Grok became so antisemitic after just a single update. On social media, there has been speculation that a rogue system prompt may explain what happened. System prompts are a set of instructions AI model developers give to their chatbots before the start of a conversation. They give the model a set of guidelines to adhere to, and define the tools it can turn to for help in answering a prompt.\nIn May xAI blamed \"an unauthorized modification\" to Grok's prompt on X for the chatbot's brief obsession with \"white genocide\" in South Africa. The fact that the change was made at 3:15AM PT made many suspect Elon Musk had done the tweak himself. Following the incident, xAI open sourced Grok's system prompts, allowing people to view them publicly on GitHub. After Tuesday's episode, people noticed xAI had deleted a recently added system prompt that told Grok its responses should \"not shy away from making claims which are politically incorrect, as long as they are well substantiated.\"\nMessing also doesn't believe the deleted system prompt is the smoking gun some online believe it to be.\n\"If I were trying to ensure a model didn't respond in hateful/racist ways I would try to do that during post-training, not as a simple system prompt. Or at the very least, I would have a hate speech detection model running that would censor or provide negative feedback to model generations that were clearly hateful,\" he said. \"So it's hard to say for sure, but if that one system prompt was all that was keeping xAI from going off the rails with Nazi rhetoric, well that would be like attaching the wings to a plane with duct tape.\"\nHe added: \"I would definitely say a shift in training, like a new training approach or having a different pre-training or post-training setup would more likely explain this than a system prompt, particularly when that system prompt doesn’t explicitly say, 'Do not say things that Nazis would say.'\"\nOn Wednesday, Musk suggested Grok was effectively baited into being hateful. \"Grok was too compliant to user prompts,\" he said. \"Too eager to please and be manipulated, essentially. That is being addressed.\" According to Messing, there is some validity to that argument, but it doesn't provide the full picture. \"Musk isn’t necessarily wrong,\" he said,  \"There’s a whole art to 'jailbreaking' an LLM, and it’s tough to fully guard against in post-training. But I don’t think that fully explains the set of instances of pro-Nazi text generations from Grok that we saw.\"\nIf there's one takeaway from this episode, it's that one of the issues with foundational AI models is just how little we know about their inner workings. As Messing points out, even with Meta's open-weight Llama models, we don't really know what ingredients are going into the mix. \"And that's one of the fundamental problems when we're trying to understand what's happening in any foundational model,\" he said, \"we don't know what the pre-training data is.\"\nIn the specific case of Grok, we don't have enough information right now to know for sure what went wrong. It could have been a single trigger like an errant system prompt, or, more likely, a confluence of factors that includes the system's training data. However, Messing suspects we may see another incident just like it in the future.\n\"[AI models] are not the easiest things to control and align,\" he said. \"And if you're moving fast and not putting in the proper guardrails, then you're privileging progress over a sort of care. Then, you know, things like this are not surprising.\"This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/how-exactly-did-grok-go-full-mechahitler-151020144.html?src=rss",

Netflix has been licensing shows from the BBC and Channel 4 in the UK for a number of years, for example, and back in 2022 Disney and the BBC started co-producing Doctor Who, with Disney+ becoming the home of the long-running sci-fi show outside of the UK.

    "summary": "One of our favorite robot vacuums from Eufy, the 11S Max, has dropped to $140 thanks to Amazon Prime Day deals. That's half off its regular price and one of the best discounts we've seen — and even better, it's still in stock as of right now on day three.\nThis model earned a top spot on our list of the best budget-friendly robot vacuums. Arguably the coolest feature here is the 11S Max's thin profile, which allows it to slide under short tables and other places typical robovacs are too chonky to reach. It's also extremely quiet during use, so it can be operated at night without waking everyone up. \n\n\nIt runs for around 100 minutes per charge and it'll head to the outlet on its own for some juice. The vacuum automatically adapts suction power to suit different floor types. We found the obstacle avoidance here to be excellent, thanks to an included infrared sensor. It also ships with a remote control for those who want to ensure certain parts of the home get extra attention.\nThis is a budget robovac, so there are some tradeoffs. First of all, it doesn't connect to WiFi and there's no affiliated app. It doesn't really need it, as the obstacle avoidance tech gets the job done, but this does mean that owners can't set schedules or create maps with no-go zones.\nFinally, it's just a vacuum. There's no mop here and it doesn't ship with a debris canister. It'll have to get emptied after every use. Still, the price is certainly right.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/this-prime-day-eufy-robot-vacuum-deal-is-still-in-stock-and-saves-you-50-percent-153859746.html?src=rss",

    "full_text": "In April 2025, a new company called Slate Auto came out of stealth and shocked the car industry. Unlike other EV startups, Slate had been working on developing an extremely low-cost electric pickup truck that would start at around $25,000. April 25 – TechCrunch reported that Slate had identified a former printing plant in Warsaw, Indiana as the location for its truck factory. The 1.4 million-square-foot facility was built in 1958 and had been dormant for around two years. May 12 – Slate confirmed to TechCrunch it had already surpassed 100,000 refundable $50 reservations for its affordable EV truck. It was evidence that the company’s ideas had caught on with a wide audience, despite no one knowing about Slate just two months prior. Slate Auto drops ‘under $20,000’ pricing after Trump administration ends federal EV tax credit As such, Slate pulled that language from its website before the bill was even signed into law. July 8 – Slate’s 2023 funding round included at least 16 investors — one of them being Bezos. While most of those investors have still not been identified, Los Angeles-based Slauson & Co. spoke to TechCrunch about why it threw in with the EV startup in that initial funding round, as well as Slate’s Series B."

After launching Veo 3-powered video generation in May, Google made the feature available in over 150 countries as of last week. At the moment, only Google AI Ultra and Google AI Pro plan users can generate videos with a three-creations-per-day limit with no carry-over. What image-to-video generation with Veo 3 looks like Image Credits:Google Google said that users can generate a clip by selecting the “Videos” option from the tool menu in the prompt box and uploading a photo. Once the video is generated, you can download it or share it with others. The company noted that since its release seven weeks ago, users have created more than 40 million videos across the Gemini app and Flow tool. All videos generated using the Veo 3 model will have a visible watermark that says “Veo” along with an invisible SynthID digital watermark, which is adopted by Google’s AI tool to identify AI-powered digital artifacts. Earlier this year, the company also released a tool that helps you detect content containing SynthID."

    "full_text": "In Brief U.K. authorities confirmed on Thursday they had arrested four individuals for allegedly carrying out a series of hacks earlier this year targeting the British retail sector, including Marks & Spencer, Harrods, and the Co-op. The National Crime Agency said a woman aged 20, two men aged 19, and a youth aged 17 were arrested on Thursday at locations across the U.K. under suspicion of hacking, blackmail, money laundering, and participating in an organized crime group. The suspects weren’t named, but were taken into custody in relation to the hacks, the NCA said. Starting in April, hackers started breaking in and stealing customer data from the Co-op, and later Marks & Spencer. Both intrusions were attributed to Scattered Spider, a collective of hackers and techniques that use impersonation and deception tactics to trick call centers and company help desks into granting them access to their networks. The hackers allegedly used their access to allow a ransomware gang called DragonForce to deploy its file-encrypting malware on Marks & Spencer’s network. The Co-op reportedly avoided the ransomware by pulling down its own network before the hackers could activate the malware. Harrods, too, said it rebuffed much of a cyberattack."

    "full_text": "Elon Musk said in a post on X early Thursday morning that Grok, the chatbot from his AI company, xAI, will be coming to Tesla vehicles “very soon.” “Next week at the latest,” he said. The news that Grok would be coming to Tesla vehicles soon comes several hours after xAI debuted the latest flagship AI model, Grok 4. Fans had wondered loudly why Musk spent an hour late on Wednesday talking about Grok with no mention of a Tesla integration, which likely prompted the billionaire’s early morning announcement. Musk is known for making Tesla-related announcements on X, the social media platform he owns, oftentimes before he even tells his own engineers. In this case, they might have seen it coming. Musk has teased that Grok would end up in Tesla vehicles as an AI assistant for months, saying that Tesla drivers would be able to chat conversationally with their cars and ask Grok to perform certain tasks. While poking around in Tesla’s firmware, a hacker who goes by the name “green” last week found that drivers can choose between certain Grok “personalities,” including ones that are NSFW (not safe for work). Green’s findings also suggest that Grok will only be available on newer vehicles with Hardware 3. Grok will also be the voice and brain for Tesla’s humanoid robot Optimus, Musk confirmed recently."

    "full_text": "In Brief A U.S. appeals court has blocked the Federal Trade Commission’s “click-to-cancel” rule that would have required companies to make it as easy to cancel a subscription as it was to sign up. The rule was set to take effect on July 14. Reuters reports that the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in St. Louis said on Wednesday that the FTC, which passed the rule under former Democratic Chair Lina Khan, had failed to conduct a preliminary analysis of the costs and benefits of the rule. The regulation would have required businesses to allow customers to cancel their subscriptions using the same method they used to sign up. For example, if signing up for a membership only took a few clicks, canceling it shouldn’t require navigating through numerous web pages or dealing with a chatbot. The rule would also have required businesses to obtain consent before charging customers for memberships, auto-renewals, or programs tied to free trial offers."
