    "summary": "After testing around a dozen ereaders, we think the best bet for most people is the Kobo Clara Colour. But the base-model Kindle is also good, offering a cheap and easy entry point into ebooks. And Boox makes a few E Ink readers that do more than just display books. Now that most ereader companies also offer color models, the field is wider than ever. In short, there are a few things to consider before buying your next (or first) ereader and this guide covers product recommendations alongside advice on how to get the most out of your new device.\nTable of contents\n\nBest ereaders\nWhat to look for in an ereader\nHow to get books for your ereader\nHow we test ereaders\nEreader FAQs\nRecent updates\n\nThe best ebook readers for 2025\n \n  \n \n \n\n \n \n \nWhat to look for in an ereader\nPlenty of apps, including the Kindle app, will let you download and read digital books on an iPhone, Android Phone or tablet. But what makes ebook readers different is the screen: nearly all of them use technology from a company called E Ink. It manufactures electronic paper displays (EPD) composed of three sheets: one containing millions of microcapsules filled with black and white ink particles sandwiched between transparent electrode layers. When a charge is applied, either the black or white particles shift to the top, forming letters and the whitespace around them. \nColor ereaders add a color filter array on top of the standard black and white microcapsule layer. The result is two different resolutions on one screen — the color clarity is 150 dpi while black and white images and text are still 300 dpi.\nBecause these displays are so different from standard backlight LED panels, you can expect most good ereaders to do a number of things well. They’ll be easier to stare at for long periods of time and easier to read in direct sunlight. Also, since E Ink displays only require power to rearrange the ink, these devices have much longer battery lives than even the best tablets: we’re talking weeks on a single charge, not days.\nThe ereader market is not as saturated as, say, the smartphone market, but there are still plenty of options out there and they do have small but important differences among them. They tend to range from around $100 to more than $400, though usually the higher end options are stylus-enabled read/write E Ink tablets like the Kindle Scribe. Beyond price, you should consider physical properties like buttons, lights, storage and resolution, as well as how the software lets you find and access books.\nReading features\nWith any ereader, you’ll navigate the OS via taps and swipes, and some add physical page-turn buttons. Most with built-in buttons have an auto-rotating screen so you can press with your right or left hand.\nAs E Ink technology has advanced, resolution has greatly improved – even the budget Kindle ereader has a 300 ppi display. You can still find models with lower resolution, but we don’t recommend them.\nSome ereaders have front LEDs that support light temperature adjustment. That means you can switch to a warmer light after the sun goes down, which will feel easier on the eyes. If you’re concerned about blue light, you should go for a reader with that feature. Finally, dark mode is available on most later model ereaders, allowing you to invert the black and white text and background, which some people find easier to read in low-light settings. \nOther features\nThe capabilities of these pocket libraries have advanced considerably since the early days. In addition to storing books, some let you browse the web, run apps and play music. The screen’s frame rate can’t handle gaming, but it’s good enough to show you the Wikipedia entry for Striver’s Row while you read Crook Manifesto.\nIf you listen to audiobooks, you may want a Bluetooth-enabled ereader capable of playing them. Most of the models we tested have that ability, with the notable exception of the Nook ereader we tried. Keep in mind that audiobook files can take up more space than print files so you'll probably want a device with a higher storage capacity if you plan on doing a lot of listening.\nAbove all, you should consider where and how you intend to find books to read. Most ereaders make it easiest to shop through their own digital bookstores, but all of them (even Kindles) will now let you download titles from other sources, like libraries, unaffiliated ebook sellers and free public domain sites.\n\n\n\n\n   Photo by Amy Skorheim / Engadget \n \n\nHow to get books for your ereader\nKindle, Nook and Kobo all have their own stores that you access directly from each brand’s devices. Prices are the same among all sellers, too. Publishers set the price of an ebook, not the retailer, so a title will cost the same at Amazon, Barnes & Noble, eBooks.com and the Kobo store.\nAmazon offers Kindle Unlimited for $12 per month, and it includes four million titles from which you can pick your next read. It includes audio and ebooks, but you won’t find many big, new releases or older bestsellers. Kobo has a subscription called Kobo Plus with about 1.3 million titles: it goes for $8 per month for ebooks only, $8 for audiobooks only or $10 for both.\nBuying a book from a proprietary store instantly delivers it to your device, provided you’re connected to WiFi. It also syncs your reading across devices and apps, so you can pick up where you left off on your phone if you forgot your ereader at home. It truly is the most convenient way to go, but if you don’t want to be locked into one brand’s store, or if you opt for an ereader without its own marketplace, you do have options.\nHow to upload ePubs onto an ereader\nStores like ebooks.com and Google Play have millions of ebooks for sale as digital rights-managed (DRM) ePub files, which Kobo, Nook and PocketBook readers can read in their native ereader apps. Kindles don’t support DRM ePub files at all and Boox devices require third party reading apps (of which there are many) to read those files. Titles from Apple Books are only readable in iOS devices. \nTitles from some publishers like Tor and public domain classics from sites like Project Gutenberg are also sold as ePubs, but without the added DRM. Consequently, Kindles and the Boox Neoreader do support those files. Books you get from third-party sources will look just like ones you bought from a proprietary store, thanks to the flowable, formatted nature of ePub files. While these device-agnostic ebook collections give you extra options for finding your next read, they require a few additional steps to get the files onto your ereader.\nTo do so, you’ll typically need a computer running a free program called Adobe Digital Editions (ADE). After buying and downloading the ePub file, open ADE and plug your ereader into your computer (all readers here have a USB-C port for charging and data transfers). Your device should pop up in the left panel. Drag and drop the ePub file from your downloads folder into the main panel in ADE. The file will display as an image of the book cover. Drag that image onto your device on the left panel. If the file includes digital rights management (which protects against unauthorized copying) you’ll need to authorize your ereader, which requires using or creating a free Adobe ID. Once you’ve finished adding files to upload, eject the reader from your computer to complete the transfer process.\nKindles use a web-based uploader instead of the ADE method. But since Kindle uses its own proprietary DRM technology instead of Adobe's, the only files it can accept from third parties are non-DRM files, such as from Tor Publishing or Project Gutenberg. After downloading a compatible ePub file, drag and drop it into your browser with the Send to Kindle page open. As long as you’re signed into Amazon, this wirelessly transfers the files to your associated device.\nBoox also uses a browser uploader called BooxDrop (along with many other methods) to deliver ePubs to the device. Open it from the Boox App menu and you’ll see a device-specific url. Type that into your browser to access a file delivery portal that uploads to your library. Boox’s built-in ereader app, NeoReader, also doesn’t support files with DRM, so you won’t be able to read current titles from most publishers using that app. Fortunately, Boox devices run nearly every ereader app out there, Kobo and Kindle included, letting you access ePubs any number of ways.\nRecently, Bookshop.org, the online seller of physical books that supports indie bookstores, started selling ebooks and up to 100 percent of the profits will go to local booksellers. The company uses a different rights management system than ADE so, right now, you can only read titles you buy from them on the Bookshop.org app, but the company is working with the makers of both Kindle and Kobo to extend compatibility to those ereaders.\nHow to read library books on an ereader\nYour local library card lets you borrow audio and ebooks through a program called Overdrive and its companion app Libby. On a Kobo, you have have built-in access to Overdrive in a separate tab. Once you’ve linked your public library card, the search function will include results for titles available from your local library system; a few taps will upload your selections to your device for the length of the loan. I personally find it easiest to borrow the title I want through the Libby app on my phone. After that, the book pops up on my Kobo’s home screen once the device syncs.\nTo read library books on a Kindle, you can either go through the Libby app or the Overdrive section of your library’s website. Once you click Borrow, you’ll see the option to “Read now with Kindle,” which takes you to Amazon’s site to sign in. After that, the book will be delivered to your device the next time it connects to WiFi.\nFor other ereaders, you’ll go through your library’s Overdrive portal and download the ePub after clicking the Borrow button. You can then use the ADE process we described above. Devices that run external apps, like Boox's Page, Go Color 7 or Palma, allow you to read library books via the Libby app, just as you would on a smartphone or iPad.\nYou can also use the Libby app to borrow audiobooks, but you won’t be able to access them through your ereader. (The exception is an ereader, like a Boox device, that allows external apps). I found it was easier to listen to an audiobook on my phone anyway, regardless of whether I borrowed it through Libby or bought it from Kindle or Kobo.\n\n\n\n\n   Photo by Amy Skorheim / Engadget \n \n\nHow we test ereaders\nWhen putting together any guide, the first thing we do is spend hours researching the field. We look at what’s available, what’s new, and what shoppers and professional reviewers have to say. Then we narrow a list to the best candidates for hands-on testing.\nOver the course of the past two years, I’ve tested just over a dozen ereaders, representing five different brands: Amazon, Kobo, Barnes & Noble, Boox and PocketBook. I bought, borrowed and uploaded books for each device using the methods above. I used each one for between a few days to a few months. I evaluated each one in the areas of book access, ease of reading, extra features and overall value. Here’s everything we tested so far:\n\nAmazon Kindle (2022)\nAmazon Kindle (2024)\nAmazon Kindle Paperwhite (2021)\nAmazon Kindle Paperwhite Signature (2024)\nBoox Go Color 7 \nBoox Leaf 2\nBoox Page\nBoox Poke 5\nBoox Palma\nKobo Libra 2\nKobo Libra Colour\nKobo Clara 2E\nKobo Clara Colour\nKobo Nia\nNOOK GlowLight 4 \nPocketBook Era\n\nOther ereaders we tested\nAmazon Kindle Colorsoft\nAmazon’s first color Kindle impressed with its quick page-turns and load times, auto-adjusting front light and, of course, a decently striking color E Ink display. But at $280, it’s more expensive than all of the other color ereaders in its size range, including the Kobo Libra Colour and the Boox Go Color 7.\nAlso, some Colorsoft owners reported seeing a yellow band at the bottom of their ereader’s display. This issue did not affect our first review unit during the original testing period, but it eventually appeared. An Amazon spokesperson told Engadget: \"A small number of customers have reported a yellow band along the bottom of the display. We take the quality of our products seriously—customers who notice this can reach out to our customer service team for a replacement or refund, and we’re making the appropriate adjustments to ensure that new devices will not experience this issue moving forward.\"\nAmazon sent us a new Colorsoft ereader at the end of 2024 and it does appear that the fixes the company made resolved the yellow-band issue. The screen on our second review unit appears warmer overall, but not overly so. It’s more akin to the screen on the Kobo Libra Colour, and that’s a good thing.\nBoox Go 7 stylus-enabled ereader\nBoox recently released two new stylus-enabled generations of their seven-inch reader: The monochrome Go 7 and a color-screen Go Color 7 (Gen II). After trying out the stylus-enabled Go 7, I still like the standard, non-stylus enabled version better. True, I liked the Notebook app with its array of handwriting templates and I appreciated the low-to-no latency with the stylus. It also offers a good assortment of brush, pen and style options. But outside of the Notebook app, I didn’t find much use for the stylus.\nI was able to doodle in the margins of DRM-free books in Boox’s native NeoReader, but it doesn’t work in other apps or on any rights-managed books. There's a FreeMark option that allows you to draw or write atop any app, but it saves your doodles as separate images, as opposed to allowing you to mark up the page itself. I also found enabling the stylus to be a little glitchy. If you plan to do a lot of writing, you’ll probably be better served by an E Ink tablet, but if you want an ereader that can mark up your books, I suggest going with the Kobo Libra Color, detailed above.\nEreader FAQs\nWhat's the difference between an ereader and an e-ink reader?\nReally, they are the same thing. E Ink is a company that designs and manufactures the paper-like screens found in most ereader devices. Technically, anything you read ebooks on can act as an ereader, so your phone, iPad or Android tablet could all serve that purpose, but they’re not considered dedicated ereaders. While there are some devices marketed as ereaders that have LCD or OLED screens instead of E Ink, they aren’t as common. One of the benefits of ereaders is the E Ink screen’s paper-like quality, which causes less eye strain for many people.\nBut there is a difference between ereaders and E Ink tablets. These larger e-ink devices also employ E Ink screens, but they have stylus input and are often used for note taking and other tasks in addition to reading ebooks. We have an entire guide devoted to helping you pick out an E Ink tablet.\nAre there ads on my ereader?\nThe base model Kindle and Kindle Paperwhite come with ads by default, but you can opt to pay $20 to remove them, either at the time of purchase or after you start using the device. The ads are limited to the lockscreen and are typically for other books or Kindle services. Kobo and Boox ereaders don’t come with ads.\nWhich ereader has the longest battery life?\nOf the devices we tested, the Boox Go Color 7 has the largest listed battery capacity at 2,300mAh (Amazon doesn’t list the capacity of its Kindle devices). But thanks to the nature of E Ink screens and the relatively limited processing power required to display e-books, nearly all ereaders can go for weeks before they need a recharge. That means battery life probably isn’t as much of a deciding factor in buying an ereader as it would be with a tablet or smartphone.\nWhich ereaders can read Kindle books?\nAmazon’s Kindle ereaders are the obvious answer, but other devices capable of running apps can also read titles from the Kindle store. For example, you can download the Kindle app on a Boox ereader through Google Play (the store comes standard in the Boox app menu). You can then sign into your Kindle account and access all the books in your library — the same way you’d read Kindle books on your phone or tablet.\nCan you buy Kindle books without a Kindle?\nYes. You can buy Kindle books through the Kindle app or through Amazon’s website via a browser. You can read those titles on a Kindle or any device that can run the Kindle app, such as a smartphone, tablet or computer. Just be aware that Kindle titles can only be read through one of Amazon’s ereaders or the Kindle app. The company uses proprietary digital rights management on all ebooks it sells that can’t be read by other ereader apps like Kobo or Adobe ADE.\nWhat's the difference between Kindle and Kobo?\nBoth Kindle and Kobo are brands of dedicated ereaders that support searching, buying, downloading and reading ebooks from their own stores. Both also support borrowing books from your local library via Overdrive and Libby.\nThe difference is that Kindle is owned by Amazon and uses the Kindle store, whereas Kobo is owned by Rakuten and its books come from the Kobo store. Both stores come pre-loaded as a tab on their respective ereader and both carry most in-print books. Each store also carries their own exclusive ebooks as well, but Amazon’s library of Kindle-only books is much larger than Kobo’s. Amazon also offers Amazon Original stories to read on the Kindle, which are free short fiction and nonfiction reads that are free to Prime members.\nWhich ereader is best for library books?\nBoth Kobos and Kindles have simple systems for borrowing library books. Other ereaders, like Boox, let you borrow books after downloading the Libby App. Only Kobo ereaders let you search for and borrow books directly on the ereader, with a dedicated Overdrive tab. Kindles, on the other hand, utilize a convenient “read on Kindle” function from the Libby app or website. You can send a borrowed book to your Kindle just by signing into your account. Both methods are pretty easy, so which is the best for you probably depends on other factors than just the library-book feature.\nRecent updates\nAugust 2025: Included new frequently asked questions covering battery life, E Ink screens and ads on ereaders. Mentioned Amazon’s release of a cheaper Colorsoft Kindle.\nJuly 2025: Added our impressions of the new stylus-enabled Boox Go 7 series. Updated our Boox Palma recommendation to account for the upgrades to the Boox Palma 2. Included text formats to our specs and the battery life of the Kobo Clara Colour.\nMarch 2025: Added news about Bookshop.org getting into the ebook market. Updated information about price-setting by publishers.\nJanuary 2025: Updated the \"Others we tested\" section to include impressions of the second Kindle Colorsoft review unit we received.\nAugust 2024: Replaced our Android tablet pick with the new Go Color 7 ereader from Boox. Updated book titles to current examples. Added an FAQ section to explain the difference between Kobo and Kindle ereaders and further detail library-book support on different models. \nNovember 2024: Following the release of Amazon's new Kindle ereaders, we tested and reviewed the Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition, the base-model Kindle and Amazon's new color ereader, the Kindle Colorsoft. Accordingly, we updated our budget pick, added a premium pick and noted our experience with the Colorsoft. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/best-ereader-130013808.html?src=rss",
    "full_text": "When Rakuten announced the Clara would be updated, I worried we’d see Kobo device with superfluous revamping to justify an inflated price. I created one with larger text and wider line spacing called “tired eyes.” Some people won’t be bothered by the lock screen ads that come standard on this Kindle (unless you pay $20 to remove them). You can pick from four different highlighter colors and view your written notes and spotlighted text in the notes section of any title — which I could see being pretty useful for book club reads, school assignments or just refreshing yourself on a past read before you dive into the sequel. While there is a store, it’s made up of public domain titles — most people will read books by uploading ePubs manually. But what makes ebook readers different is the screen: nearly all of them use technology from a company called E Ink. Because these displays are so different from standard backlight LED panels, you can expect most good ereaders to do a number of things well. Amazon offers Kindle Unlimited for $12 per month, and it includes four million titles from which you can pick your next read. After downloading a compatible ePub file, drag and drop it into your browser with the Send to Kindle page open. The company uses proprietary digital rights management on all ebooks it sells that can’t be read by other ereader apps like Kobo or Adobe ADE.

    "summary": "Whether you're working in a noisy office, commuting on a packed train or just trying to focus at home, a good pair of noise-canceling headphones can make all the difference. The best noise-canceling headphones block out distractions and let you enjoy your music, podcasts or calls in peace — all while delivering great sound quality and all-day comfort. From models with plush cushions to wireless cans with loads of extra features, there’s something here for every style and budget.\nTable of contents\n\nBest noise-canceling headphones for 2025\nHow to choose the best noise-canceling headphones for you\nHow we test noise-canceling headphones\nOther noise-canceling headphones we tested\nNoise-canceling headphones FAQs\n\nBest noise-canceling headphones of 2025\n \n \n \n \n \n\nHow to choose the best noise-canceling headphones for you\nDesign\nWhen you’re shopping for the best wireless headphones, the first thing you’ll need to decide on is wear style. Do you prefer on-ear or over-ear headphones? For the purposes of this guide, I focus on the over-ear style as that’s what most noise-canceling headphones are nowadays. Sure, you can find on-ear models with ANC, but over-ear, active noise-canceling headphones are much more effective at blocking outside sounds since your ears are completely covered. \nFor gamers, there are also gaming headsets that feature noise cancellation — some even have detachable microphones, so they can double as over-ear headphones. However, for the purpose of this article, we’re only going to be focusing on noise-canceling headphones rather than headsets. Look for models with a comfortable headband and memory foam ear cups to ensure you can wear them for long periods without discomfort.\nMany headphones also come with a range of color options, so if aesthetics matter to you, you’ll find plenty of choices beyond just black or white. Whether you’re looking for something neutral or a bold pop of color, brands now offer a variety of styles to match your personal taste.\nFinally, if you’re planning to wear your headphones for long periods of time, it’s important to pick a model with a comfortable fit. Memory foam ear cups, an adjustable headband, and lightweight materials can make all the difference during extended listening sessions. After all, great sound is only part of the equation; comfort matters just as much.\nType of noise cancellation\nNext, you’ll want to look at the type of ANC a set of headphones offers. You’ll come across terms like “hybrid active noise cancellation” or “hybrid adaptive active noise cancellation,” and there are key differences between the two. A hybrid ANC setup uses microphones on the inside and on the outside of the device to detect outside noise and cancel it out. By analyzing input from both mics, a hybrid system can combat more sounds than “regular” ANC, but it does so at a constant level that doesn’t change.\nAdaptive ANC takes the hybrid configuration a step further by continuously adjusting the noise cancellation for changes in your environment and any leakage around the padding of the ear cups. Adaptive noise-canceling also does a better job with wind noise, which can really kill your vibe while using headphones outdoors. Some high-end headphones also support Dolby Atmos, which enhances spatial audio and makes everything from music to movies sound more immersive. For the purposes of this best headphones list, I’m only considering products with hybrid ANC or adaptive ANC setups because those are the most effective at blocking noise and improving your overall listening experience.\nCustomization\nYou’ll also want to check to see if the ANC system on a prospective set of headphones offers adjustable levels of noise cancellation or presets. These can help you dial in the amount of ANC you need for various environments, but it can also help you save battery life. Master & Dynamic, for example, has ANC presets that provide both maximum noise blocking and more efficient cancellation that is more energy efficient. Other companies may include a slider in their companion apps that let you adjust the ANC level to your liking. Some high-end models even allow you to fine-tune the ANC for specific types of environments.\nHow we test noise-canceling headphones\nThe primary way we test headphones is to wear them as much as possible. I prefer to do this over a one-to-two-week period, but sometimes deadlines don’t allow it. During this time, I listen to a mix of music and podcasts, while also using the headphones to take both voice and video calls.\nSince battery life for headphones can be 30 hours or more, I drain the battery with looping music and the volume set at a comfortable level (usually around 75 percent). Due to the longer battery estimates, I’ll typically power the headphones off several times and leave them that way during a review. This simulates real-world use and keeps me from having to constantly monitor the process for over 24 straight hours.\nTo test ANC performance specifically, I use headphones in a variety of environments, from noisy coffee shops to quiet home offices. When my schedule allows, I use them during air travel since plane noise is a massive distraction to both work and relaxation. Even if I can’t hop on a flight, I’ll simulate a constant roar with white noise machines, bathroom fans, vacuums and more. I also make note of how well each device blocks human voices, which are a key stumbling block for a lot of ANC headphones.\nANC-related features are something else to consider. Here, I do a thorough review of companion apps, testing each feature as I work through the software. Any holdovers from previous models are double checked for improvements or regression. If the headphones I’m testing are an updated version of a previous model, I’ll spend time getting reacquainted with the older set. Ditto for the closest competition for each new set of headphones that I review.\nOther noise-canceling headphones we tested\nAirPods Max\nApple’s AirPods Max are premium, well-designed over-ear headphones that incorporate all of the best features you find on standard AirPods: solid noise cancellation, spatial audio and easy Siri access. However, their $550 starting price makes them almost prohibitively expensive, even for Apple users. There are better options available at lower prices, but if you can pick up the AirPods Max at a steep discount, they might be worthwhile for the biggest Apple fans among us.\nDyson On-Trac\nThe On-Trac headphones have an almost infinitely customizable design, and that’s what’s most unique about them. The sound profile offers some nice detail, but lacks dynamic range overall. ANC is average at best and there aren’t any advanced features that will make your life easier. Well, except for the hearing health monitor, which is actually handy. All told, that’s not a lot for a set of $500 headphones.\nSonos Ace\nThe Sonos Ace is an excellent debut for the company’s first headphones. The combination of refined design, great sound quality and home theater tricks creates a unique formula. However, ANC performance is just okay and key functionality is still in the works for many users.\nSony ULT Wear\nIf most headphones don’t have the level of bass you desire, the ULT Wear is an option to consider. The low-end thump isn’t for everyone, but there are also plenty of handy features and a refined look to make the $200 set more compelling than many in this price range.\nBeats Studio Pro\nThe Studio Pro lacks basic features like automatic pausing, and multipoint connectivity is only available on Android. Moreover, they’re not very comfortable for people with larger heads. Overall sound quality is improved, though, and voice performance on calls is well above average.\nMaster & Dynamic MH40 (2nd gen)\nThe MH40 are a great set of headphones if you favor crisp, clear and natural sound that isn’t overly tuned. This pair showcases the company’s affinity for leather and metal too, but limited customization and short battery life for non-ANC cans kept this set from making the cut.\nBowers & Wilkins Px8\nThe company’s trademark pristine sound is on display here, but the Px8 is more expensive and not nearly as comfortable as the Px7 S3.\nNoble Audio FoKus Apollo\nWhile this is my top pick for overall sound quality in our main guide to the best wireless headphones, the ANC performance is less impressive than the Px7 S3. Bowers & Wilkins gets the nod here for its improved noise cancellation over the Px7 S2 and Px7 S2e, and its overall excellent audio quality.\nNoise-canceling headphones FAQs\nDoes noise cancellation block all noise?\nNoise cancellation doesn’t block out all noise, though it does drastically reduce the volume of most external sounds.\nIs there a difference between wired vs wireless noise-canceling headphones?\nIn terms of sound quality, if you have two headphones — one wired and one wireless — with similar specs, the difference is going to be very minimal. However, wireless headphones offer more convenience, allowing you to move around more freely with your headphones on, which is why they often feature noise cancellation to minimize external sounds.\nDoes noise cancellation impact sound quality?\nANC does bear some weight on sound quality, but the impact of this often doesn’t outweigh the benefits. Noise cancellation reduces ambient noise, allowing a greater focus on audio detail. For audiophiles, however, there may be a small difference in sound fidelity when ANC is turned on.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/best-noise-canceling-headphones-130029881.html?src=rss",

It's also worth mentioning that you can hit the same button to pause lengthy radio conversations as well. One such example is killing Ocelot after meeting him for the first time. You'll miss out on important visuals while the game just shows your character looking into binoculars, for example. This gives you back your right thumb in order to regain camera control while dragging someone out of sight. This means silencers are quite important for avoiding gun fights and staying hidden. To avoid overusing them, remove the silencers anytime you engage in a big gun fight or boss battle. It allows you to see enemies through walls and will help spot bosses during big fights. With those 11 tips you'll now start off on a much stronger footing when playing through Metal Gear Solid Delta."

There are also some \"quality of life\" changes, such as frequent auto-saves and quicker menu access. There's not even additional voice acting in this particular cutscene, just remixed dialogue from other scenes. Another returning bonus is Snake vs. Monkey on the PS5 and PC versions (a bizarre extra from the original MGS3), while Xbox players get Snake vs. Bomberman. The camo collection lets you track what gear you've unlocked (and what's still missing), while the food collection catalogs every animal and item Snake has eaten. If you've never played MGS3 and are curious, this remake is a must. But if that doesn't describe you, it's not an immediate pick-up.

That seems to be the plan for Blue Eye Samurai’s next season.

    "summary": "Since it was announced in June, Trump Mobile has committed to an increasingly-surreal smoke-and-mirrors approach to its promised T1 smartphone. Despite the initial claims that the phone would be made in the United States, it seemed highly unlikely from the start that it was accurate. The \"Made in USA\" claims were quietly removed from the Trump Mobile website at a later date.

    "full_text": "A new “My apps” feature is being tested in the Xbox app for Windows 11, and it looks like another way to avoid having to launch the main Microsoft Store or hunt for downloads online if you’re on a gaming PC. Microsoft has already been adding Steam, Battle.net, Ubisoft Connect, and other PC games into to a unified library inside its Xbox app, but this my apps view will be useful on a handheld PC where you want to avoid using the Windows desktop interface as much as possible. “My apps enables players on an ROG Xbox Ally or other Windows 11 handhelds to more easily navigate between applications from the Xbox full screen experience,” says Dhaliwal. The Xbox app will let you install rival storefronts and third-party apps. I’ve briefly tested the My apps view today and it lists Battle.net, Chrome, and GOG Galaxy. I have Chrome and Battle.net installed, so it simply launches these apps, but with GOG Galaxy it tries to download and install the app all within the Xbox UI. I say try because it failed to install during my testing, but this is a beta so there are bound to be bugs. Microsoft is testing this with a “tailored selection of apps” right now, and plans to expand support for additional apps over time. It’s an interesting move, particularly given Microsoft’s work on merging the best bits of Windows and Xbox together for the Xbox Ally handheld gaming PCs. Microsoft said last year that it wanted to make the Xbox app the home of PC gaming, and it’s sure trying to make that a reality."

The carpet performance isn't particularly impressive, so it'll be a better option for those with hard flooring. Dirt Devil BD5700V: For those with primarily hardwood flooring, the Dirt Devil BD5700V delivered one of the highest scores we've seen on a cordless vacuum, removing nearly 100% of sand from a hardwood floor. The Dirt Devil BD5700V is notable for its classic bright red accents and remarkably lightweight body. Dustbin size could also be bigger; it's only 0.48 liters, meaning more frequent emptying during cleaning sessions. Levoit LVAC-200 also comes with a two-in-one crevice tool and a two-in-one pet tool to help clean up any and every mess, although it would have been nice to have some additional attachments for cleaning upholstery or digging deeper into carpet for pet hair. It only lasted 25 minutes during our testing, so you'll want to take a look at the Shark Stratos and Dreame Z30 for cordless vacuums that can last an hour or more. Shark Pet Plus: We still recommend this one for those who want a good vacuum without spending more than $400. It delivers strong suction on all our test surfaces, has HEPA filtration and comes with Shark's generous five-year warranty. Roborock Ace F25: This expensive wet and dry vacuum will cost you $650 at full price."

Most of the new features are either limited to premium AI subscribers and tucked behind an experiment in Google Labs, but it might not take long before they're a standard part of your future search experience. Google did not immediately respond to CNET's request for further comment. Instead of searching for restaurant reservations and then clicking on a specific website to make a reservation, AI Mode surfaces everything you need to complete the action right there. Since it's contextually aware, you can add specificities to your query that a typical Google search wouldn't handle well. You can add the type of cuisine, number of people, time and location to a single query, and AI Mode will get to work and display real-time restaurant reservation time slots to choose from. This feature is currently rolling out to Google AI Ultra subscribers in the US who have enabled the specific experiment in Labs. The experiment will use your past conversations with AI Mode, places you've interacted with on Search and Maps to provide suggestions tailored specifically to you.

Bootstrapped startup Gameskraft has also stopped accepting money on its rummy apps as a result of the legislation. “This assessment is accurate — they will have a tough fight in the Supreme Court,” a public policy expert working with some of these real-money gaming startups told TechCrunch, requesting anonymity for fear of losing clients.

    "full_text": "But you can't fully trust them yet, according to the American Automobile Association's latest study released Thursday. AAA's automotive engineers put five cars with Active Driving Assistance systems to the test. The study found a dangerous datapoint: \"notable events\" (like people cutting into your lane) where the ADA system failed to adequately deal with driving conditions happened every 3.2 miles, or every 9 minutes on average. Meanwhile, hands-off systems let you take your hands off the steering wheel in most situations. \"Most common ADAS technology today amounts to smarter versions of cruise control and lane keeping assistance. \"Even the hands-off highway assist systems like GM's Super Cruise, Ford Blue Cruise, Mercedes-Benz Drive Pilot and Tesla's FSD won't (or shouldn't) function without driver engagement.\" The bottom line is that ADA systems aren't quite ready to replace human hands-on driving and attention yet. Even if your ADA system seems flawless, AAA recommends being prepared to intervene and staying engaged while on the road. Goodwin points to Tesla, which continues to find itself in hot water over how it markets \"Full Self Driving\" and \"Autopilot\" since they are not fully autonomous driving systems. In California, Tesla is currently in the courts for another case involving Autopilot, where the state DMV is suing for allegations of false advertising and misleading customers."

Chinese smartphone maker Vivo has introduced the Vivo Vision, a headset that mixes AR and VR and bears many similarities to the Apple Vision Pro. But it also has some differences -- an 180-degree panoramic field of view and a much lighter weight at 398 grams (versus the Vision Pro's 650 grams). CNET asked Vivo if it plans to sell the Vivo Vision to non-China markets, but the company did not immediately respond. The starting cost in China will be relatively cheaper at $1,395 (converted to US dollars), compared to the Vision Pro at $3,500. Even if the Vivo Vision were made available in the US, it might not matter much to Apple's bottom line. Jon Rettinger, a tech influencer with more than 1.65 million YouTube subscribers, says he's not overly enthusiastic about VR/AR just yet. \"If the technology can go from goggles to glasses, I think we'll see a significant rise. But if the current form factors stay, it will always be niche. \"The Quest is such a better value proposition, and even there it runs into issues with long-term retention and ultimately living in a drawer once the honeymoon period ends,\" he said."

Osterloh says it’s still “TBD” whether Google itself will release glasses again, but he’s intent on the category being part of the company’s future. To be fair, Google has almost always shown off those glasses prototypes alongside the XR headsets it’s co-developing with Samsung, and — like Meta — it seems more interested in making Android XR a platform for other glasses partners too. If Google were to release glasses again, though, Bloomberg did get one interesting hint about how they might work. Osterloh and his deputy Shakil Barkat suggested in the interview that display-free glasses might pair nicely with a smaller phone, one that could unfold for your entertainment needs as well. But, again, it sounds like Google wants to “sit out” Razr-style folding flip phones for now. Google would hesitate before announcing glasses, I bet, because of its infamous fails with the original Google Glass. Lastly, if you’re curious when Pixel phone design might change again, perhaps away from big camera bumps, design chief Ivy Ross told Bloomberg that the company tries on new design languages “every two to three years.” That means it’s due."

Elon Musk’s X is tentatively settling a class action lawsuit filed by workers who were let go soon after he purchased Twitter. This news comes in the form of a court filing where both parties asked the court to delay an upcoming hearing so that they could work out a deal. After buying Twitter in 2022, Musk laid off over 6,000 Twitter employees, reducing the company’s headcount by around 80%. While Musk offered three months’ severance, the lawsuit claims that many former employees didn’t receive complete payments, while some didn’t receive any payment at all. The lawsuit also alleges that Musk’s offer of three months’ severance was lower than what employees expected from a Twitter severance plan that had been in place since 2019, which would have guaranteed senior employees severance of up to six months’ base pay, plus one week of pay per year of service. But in July, a U.S. District Judge in San Francisco ruled that Musk did not have to honor the severance agreements that these employees had entered with Twitter. The plaintiffs appealed the ruling, however, and the parties were set to enter oral arguments in a court of appeals next month before requesting that the hearing be delayed.

The OS 26es are coming with huge upgrades to your iPhone and iPad's operating systems. You've heard of Liquid Glass, right? It's like the better-executed version of Windows Vista and definitely one of the cooler features coming this fall. We spent two weeks test-driving it — you can check out our detailed hands-on iOS 26 preview, or you can try it out yourself by downloading and installing the public beta 4. That software is a more stable iteration of the separate developer version, which recently hit the beta 7 waypoint, and offers a few more flashy features not yet available in the public version. (While the public beta is open to everyone and quite stable, always remember there's a degree of risk involved with beta software.) Additionally, there are credible reports that iOS 26 could bring a new live translation feature to AirPods, too. Not sure if you want to upgrade your smartphone or tablet this year? No worries, we'll help you find out if your devices will be able to run iOS 26.\nWhile Apple didn't nix any iPhones from its eligibility list last year, that's not the case for 2025 — a few models are getting cut this time. All iPhone 8 models and the iPhone X were the last to get the boot in 2023, and this year the 2018 models are getting left behind. If you have an ineligible device, you won't be able to download iOS 26 when it becomes available this fall. \nWe'll get to the bottom of which iPhones and iPads will support iOS 26 and iPadOS 26 this year. To see what's coming with the latest OSes, check out everything announced at Apple's WWDC June 9 event. One thing you shouldn't immediately expect is Apple's updated version of Siri, though the company is reportedly working on a 'stripped-down' AI chatbot to compete with ChatGPT. \nThese three iPhones won't be compatible with iOS 26\nUnlike last year, several iPhone models won't be eligible to download the newest iOS when it makes its debut this fall. This trio of models first released in 2018 won't be coming to the iOS 26 party:\n\niPhone XR\niPhone XS\niPhone XS Max\n\niPhones compatible with iOS 26\nWhile we don't yet know the new iPhones Apple will be dropping this fall — though there are iPhone 17 rumors — we do know, per Apple's site, that the phones listed below will be compatible with iOS 26. Basically, if you have an iPhone that was announced in 2019 or later, you're in the clear:\n\niPhone SE (second generation or later)\niPhone 11\niPhone 11 Pro\niPhone 11 Pro Max\niPhone 12\niPhone 12 mini\niPhone 12 Pro\niPhone 12 Pro Max\niPhone 13\niPhone 13 mini\niPhone 13 Pro\niPhone 13 Pro Max\niPhone 14\niPhone 14 Plus\niPhone 14 Pro\niPhone 14 Pro Max\niPhone 15\niPhone 15 Plus\niPhone 15 Pro\niPhone 15 Pro Max\niPhone 16\niPhone 16 Plus\niPhone 16 Pro\niPhone 16 Pro Max\niPhone 16e\n\niPads compatible with iPadOS 26\nThe iPads listed below, and any iPads released later this year, are eligible to download iPadOS 26.\n\niPad Pro (M4)\niPad Pro 12.9‑inch (3rd generation and later)\niPad Pro 11‑inch (1st generation and later)\niPad Air (3rd generation and later, including M2 and M3)\niPad (8th generation and later, including A16)\niPad mini (5th generation and later, including A17 Pro)\n\nWhat if I don't want to buy a new iPhone?\nIf you want to continue using your older iPhone that isn't supported by iOS 26, that's fine. However, you'll miss out on security updates which could potentially put your phone at risk for malware and other threats. Additionally, some apps may stop working if they require a certain version of iOS or later. And of course, you won't be able to access the latest features iOS 26 offers.\nWhen will iOS 26 become available?\nApple usually rolls out its latest iOS in mid-September, just a few days before the new iPhones hit store shelves. Last year, it released iOS 18 on Monday, Sept. 16. Expect a confirmation of the release date at the iPhone 17 event, expected in early September. \niOS 26 features we're excited about\nLiquid Glass design: Your home screen is getting revamped with new app icons, including dark mode and all-clear options. You'll also notice buttons with a new floating design. Liquid Glass was designed to make all of Apple's OSes more cohesive.\nPhone app redesign: You'll finally be able to scroll through contacts, recent calls and voicemail messages all on one screen. It also comes with a new feature called Hold Assist that'll notify you when an agent comes to the phone so you can avoid the elevator music.\nLive Translate: iOS 26 is bringing the ability to have a conversation via phone call or text message with someone who speaks another language. Live Translate will translate your conversation in real time. \nPolls feature: Coming to group messages in the Messages app, chat members will be able to create polls. This can help prevent the unwanted 30+ messages when it comes to deciding which restaurant you're meeting at this weekend.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/apples-new-ios-26-public-beta-4-is-here-but-is-your-iphone-compatible-check-this-list-191854764.html?src=rss",

I love that it’s big enough to cook a beef stew or a whole batch of soup, while also easy to just scramble eggs in. The best thing is how much surface area it has, which makes browning meats easy to do in one batch. Plus, its super deep sides mean I can cook a one-pot meal in it without things flying out the sides when I’m stirring. My grandmother was a professional cook, and she swore by Le Creuset pans. I also have not been a model Le Creuset owner; the enamel inside is far from pristine, but I still use it all the time and don’t see any need to replace it.

    "full_text": "The explosion of AI tools worldwide is increasing exponentially, but the companies that make these tools often don't express their environmental impact in detail. Google has just released a technical paper detailing measurements for energy, emissions and water use of its Gemini AI prompts. According to its methodology for measuring AI's impact, a single prompt's energy consumption is about the equivalent of watching TV for less than 9 seconds. That's quite in a single serving, except when you consider the variety of chatbots being used, with billions of prompts easily sent every day. According to the tech giant, that's not unsubstantial, and it's a momentum that will need to be maintained going forward. Google did not immediately respond to CNET's request for further comment. For comparison, it's estimated that only using the active TPU and GPU consumption, a single Gemini prompt uses 0.10 watt-hours of energy, 0.12 milliliters of water and emits 0.02 grams of carbon dioxide equivalent. With more considerations in place, a Gemini text prompt uses 0.24Wh of energy, 0.26mL of water and emits 0.03 gCO2e -- around double across the board. Through a multilayered series of efficiencies, Google is continually working on ways to make AI's impact less burdensome, from more efficient model architectures and data centers to custom hardware. With smarter models, use cases and tools emerging daily, those efficiencies will be critical as we immerse ourselves deeper in this AI reality."

    "summary": "The latest and greatest of the foldable phone world. (Google, Sam Rutherford/Engadget)\nLast month, the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 was released and immediately became the de facto king of the foldable phone hill. But now a new challenger has arrived: The Pixel 10 Pro Fold. The full details are now available in the wake of Google's splashy launch event, which debuted the Fold alongside the full new Pixel 10 line, a new Pixel smartwatch and two new earbuds, too (see everything Google announced). But the Pixel 10 Pro Fold was the star of the show, and it's vying with the Z Fold 7 for the title of best foldable — both offer very similar designs, but each bringing something unique to the table.\nSamsung launched its first foldable phone in 2019, so it's had quite a bit of time to refine the Galaxy Fold over the years. Google on the other hand just released its first Pixel Fold a couple years ago — but has already largely evened the match. And, of course, with enhanced Gemini AI software integration front and center, you'll have access to Google's impressive artificial intelligence features at nearly every turn.\nWe'll break down how the Pixel 10 Pro Fold and Galaxy Z Fold 7 stack up to one another. You can also check out our comparison of the Pixel 9 Pro Fold and the Galaxy Fold 6 to see how much has changed in a year. \nPrice\nFirst things first, how much will one of these high-tech folding phones cost you? That is the make-or-break question, after all. The newest Pixel foldable is still less expensive than this year's Z Fold: it starts at $1,799 while the Galaxy smartphone starts at $2,000.\nYou don't have any other real choices for \"book-style\" foldables in the US market. The OnePlus Open can be had for $1,499, but it's almost two years old. And Apple's most expensive phone is currently the $1,599 1TB iPhone 16 Pro Max — but as a non-foldable model with just a single screen, it's hardly a straight comparison. If the rumor mill is to be believed, Apple may finally bow a foldable iPhone in 2026.\nDimensions and display\nIt's a race for the largest display and Samsung won this time — but not by much. The Galaxy Z Fold is just a hair bigger than the Pixel Pro Fold. Both phones' inner displays are 8 inches across when fully opened, while Samsung comes out ahead on the outer display with 6.5 inches (the Pixel is 6.4 inches).\nAs for height, the new foldable Pixel phone is 6.1 inches and the Galaxy Z is 6.2 inches — not a huge difference there. When unfolded, the Samsung wins on size efficiency, packing the identically sized 8-inch internal display into an area that's 0.3 inches smaller — 5.6 inches versus the Pixel's 5.9.\nThis year, the Pixel 10 Pro Fold’s displays have been upgraded to a Super Actua Flex OLED display with ultra-thin glass. Both the front screen and back cover come equipped with Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2.\nAs for the Galaxy Z Fold 7, it has a Dynamic AMOLED display (inner and outer) and comes with the Corning Gorilla Glass Ceramic 2 on the front and the Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on the backside. The glass is ultra-thin, yet it's 50 percent thicker than before.\nWhile slightly bigger, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 is still lighter than the Pixel 10 Pro Fold. The Samsung model weighs only 7.6 ounces — down nearly an ounce from its 2024 model — while its Google competition comes in at 9.1 ounces (the same as last year's model).\nThe Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 (left) compared to the new Pixel 10 Pro Fold (right). (Sam Rutherford/Engadget)\nProcessor, RAM, storage and battery\nThe Pixel 10 Fold Pro runs the Tensor G5 chip — Google says its CPU features 34 percent better performance compared to the Tensor G4 chip.\nThe Z Fold 7 is powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy. \"Everything feels fast and snappy,\" Engadget's Sam Rutherford said of the Snapdragon 8 Elite performance on the Z Fold 7. (Sam also has first impressions of the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, but speed tests will happen a bit later.)\nBoth phones offer the choice of 256GB, 512GB or 1TB storage. On the RAM front, the Pixel Fold delivers 16GB across the line, while the Samsung model reserves that level for the top 1TB storage tier; the small models get 12GB instead. The Galaxy phone will cost you $2,419 if you decide you need the maximum amount of storage, whereas the Pixel Fold tops out at $2,149.\nWhen it comes to battery life, Samsung's foldable lasts up to 24 hours with a 4,400mAh battery. The Pixel lasts up to 30 hours thanks to a more capacious 5,015mAh battery rating. Furthermore, the Pixel Fold is certified for Qi2 wireless charging, which Google is branding as \"Pixelsnap\" across its 2025 Pixel line for the first time.\nCameras\nFor many shoppers, a phone is only as good as its cameras, and both of these phones bring a strong lens game. Each has three rear cameras, though they're different aesthetically. You'll notice the Pixel has a larger camera bump with two rows, while the Galaxy has a thinner vertical line of cameras.\nThe Pixel 10 Pro Fold's rear camera array consists of a 48MP wide sensor, a 10.5MP ultrawide and a 10.8MP telephoto with 5x optical zoom. All three offer \"Super Res Zoom\" up to 20x with optical and electronic image stabilization. Per our own Sam Rutherford, the potential drawback here is that Google played it safe: \"The biggest potential shortcoming of the P10PF is that its camera hardware is largely staying the same. Granted, that's not a huge deal because the previous model had the best photo quality of any foldable phone.\"\nBy comparison, the Samsung Galaxy Fold 7 rear camera trio includes the same 200MP wide-angle camera as the company's Galaxy S25 Ultra, but carries over the 12MP ultrawide and 10MP telephone from the Z Fold 6. Zoom levels are 3x optical and 30x digital.\nWhile we have yet to put the Pixel 10 Pro Fold cameras through their paces, Sam was still liking last year's Pixel Fold versus the Galaxy Z Fold 7 when he reviewed the latter: \"At night, the Fold 7's shots remained surprisingly sharp. I still prefer the Pixel 9 Pro Fold due to its more accurate white balance and often sharper focus, though Samsung's phone isn't far behind.\" And the entire Pixel line's cameras are (of course) supercharged with some new Google Gemini AI niceties, like the Camera Coach feature that enables voice-controlled photo editing. \nBoth the Pixel and Galaxy offer similar 10MP specs on their front and inner selfie cameras. \nColor options\nIf you like having multiple colors to choose from, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 is winning in this category. It comes in Mint, Jetblack, Blue Shadow and Silver Shadow. Mint is only available if you buy your phone online — you won't be seeing that one in stores.\nAs for the Pixel 10 Fold Pro, your options are Moonstone and Jade.\nFull specs comparison\nGoogle Pixel 10 Pro Fold\nSamsung Galaxy Z Fold 7\nStarting price\n$1,799\n$2,000\nDimensions\nFolded: 6.1 x 3.0 x 0.4 inches (155.2 x 76.3 x 10.8mm)Unfolded: 6.1 x 5.9 x 0.2 inches (155.2 x 150.4 x 5.2mm)\nFolded: 6.2 x 2.9 x 0.4 inches (158.4 x 72.8 x 8.9mm)Unfolded: 6.2 x 5.6 x 0.2 inches (158.4 x 143.2 x 4.2mm)\nWeight\n9.1 oz (258g)\n7.6 oz (215g)\nProcessor\nTensor G5\nSnapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy (3nm)\nDisplay\nInner: 8-inch Super ActuaOuter: 6.4-inch Actua\nInner: 8-inch Dynamic AMOLEDOuter: 6.5-inch Dynamic AMOLED\nStorage\n256GB / 512GB / 1TB\n256GB / 512GB / 1TB\nRAM\n16GB\n12GB (for 256GB, 512GB configs) | 16GB (for 1TB config)\nBattery\n5,015mAh | \"Up to 30 hours\"\n4,400mAh | \"Up to 24 hours\"\nCamera\nMain: 48MP wide (F1.7) | 10.5MP Ultrawide (F2.2) | 10.8MP Telephoto lens (F3.1) with 5x optical | Super Res Zoom up to 20xFront: 10MP (F2.2)Inner: 10 MP (F2.2)\nMain: 200MP Wide (F1.7) | 12MP Ultrawide (F2.2) | 10 MP (F2.4) Telephoto (F2.4) with 3x optical zoomFront: 10MP (F2.2)Inner: 10MP (F2.2)\nStylus support\nNo\nNo\nColors\nMoonstone, Jade\nMint (online only), Jetblack, Blue Shadow, Silver Shadow\n\nUpdated August 21, 2:26PM ET: Added a section comparing the cameras on both phones.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/google-pixel-10-pro-fold-vs-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-how-the-newest-foldable-phones-stack-up-165018793.html?src=rss",

    "full_text": "General Fusion, a Canadian nuclear fusion energy startup, announced today that it had been thrown a lifeline in the form of $22 million in fresh funding. At the same time, CEO Greg Twinney wrote an open letter pleading for funding. The additional cash will give General Fusion some breathing room, though not much. General Fusion was founded in 2002 and before this round had raised $440 million, according to PitchBook. General Fusion is pursuing what’s known as “magnetized target fusion.” Inside its reactor, electricity flows through deuterium-tritium fuel — heavy hydrogen isotopes — generating a magnetic field to contain the plasma.

When Honor unveils its Magic V5 foldable at a launch event on Aug. 28 in London, it will come with what the company is calling \"the industry's first on-device large speech model,\" which will allow live AI call translation to take place on device, with no cloud processing. For aforementioned reasons, I can't test all of these, but I've already had a play around with the feature and can confirm it did a very effective job of translating my garbled messages into French. The model Honor has deployed was designed by the company in collaboration with Shanghai Jiao Tong University, based on the open-source Whisper model, said Fei Fang, president of product at Honor in an interview. \"We also work together with industry language experts to consistently and comprehensively evaluate the accuracy of our output,\" she added. It means that everything is processed locally and your calls will therefore remain completely confidential. The work Honor has done on AI call translation is set to be recognized at the upcoming Interspeech conference on speech science and tech. But already, Honor is thinking about how this use of AI can be used to enable other new and exciting features for the people who buy its phones. \"Beyond the essential user scenario of call translation, Honor's on-device large speech model will also be deployed in scenarios such as face-to-face translation [and] AI subtitles,\" said Fang. The process of developing the speech model has allowed Honor's AI team to gain extensive experience of model optimization, which it will use to develop other AI applications, she added."

Since aurora borealis comes from the effect that geomagnetic storms have on the Earth's magnetic field, we could know when auroras are happening much further in advance. NOAA has its own prediction methods that generally work well but have limitations. IBM says the inclusion of Surya may help make those predictions more accurate and timely."

There wasn’t any big controversial moment behind it.” Of course, there’s another long-in-the-works game that was originally slated to launch in 2025 but has since been pushed back: Grand Theft Auto VI.

For anyone weighing an upgrade, the real question is how the base Pixel 10 stacks up against last year’s Pixel 9. You’ll no longer have to clamp your phone in a car mount or precisely place it on a wireless charging pad. The ring of magnets provides a perfect alignment every time, eliminating the frustration of waking up to a dead phone because it was slightly misaligned. It’s the kind of upgrade that gradually rewires your habits, making the Pixel 10 feel more integrated into your daily routine than any of its predecessors. It’s nice being able to attach and detach your favorite accessories in seconds. Without one, you don’t get the reach or portrait framing a telephoto camera provides. That’s a big deal if you’ve ever tried to take a photo with digital zoom, which often results in mushy details. The Pixel 10’s main and ultrawide cameras are actually a bit smaller than what you’d find in the Pixel 9. That said, Google’s new Tensor G5 chip promises to produce higher quality images and videos, so the 10 may keep up with the 9 just fine."

The new capability, which is already available on TikTok, makes it easier for viewers to follow and discover related content. Now if a creator is telling a story in a series of videos and follow-ups, they can link them all together so that viewers don’t have to scroll or search for different parts. While the new feature is great for linking different parts of a saga, it could also be used to group together similar videos. For example, if a creator is doing a series where they’re baking a bunch of fall recipes, they can now group them all together so they’re easier to find. After a creator links reels together in a series, users will be able to navigate to the next reel using a new button located at the bottom left of the reel. Instagram says the new feature was highly requested and that it will allow for richer storytelling while also keeping audiences engaged longer, which could lead to increased watch time. The social network says it could also help turn casual viewers into followers. While the new feature isn’t a huge change, it’s a welcome addition for both creators and viewers, as it makes it easier to find and follow along with content on the platform.

So we get excited when one of the all-around best headphones out there goes on an aggressive sale.

The XM5s are supremely comfortable, thanks to a slim cushioned headband and soft earcups. In our review, we had no problem wearing them for hours at a time and never felt uncomfortable pressure on the ears or head. \n30mm carbon-fiber drivers deliver excellent audio, delivering a wide and immersive soundstage. The XM5 carries eight total microphones as part of its active noise-canceling system, up from four on the previous model, and delivers top-of-class ANC.\nThe battery life on these headphones is best in class, with around 30 hours of listening per charge.

    "summary": "Masimo, the medical technology company whose lawsuit led to the temporary sales pause of the Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2, has sued the US Customs and Border Protection days after Apple released its redesigned blood oxygen monitoring feature. This is just the latest update in the lengthy legal saga between Masimo and Apple, which started when the former sued the iPhonemaker in 2021, accusing it of infringing on several of its light-based blood oxygen monitoring patents. After a court sided with Masimo in 2023, Apple was forced to stop selling the Watch Series 9 and the Ultra 2 in the US for a few weeks. \nIn order to circumvent the import ban for the devices, Apple removed the Blood Oxygen app for the watch models sold in the US. Just a few days ago, however, the company introduced a \"redesigned Blood Oxygen feature\" for the Watch Series 9, Series 10 and Watch Ultra 2 models. The feature works by measuring and calculating data from the watches' sensors on their paired iPhones instead. Users will then be able to view their blood oxygen data in the Respiratory section of the Health app. \nApple said the update was \"enabled by a recent US Customs ruling.\" But Masimo said in its complaint (via Bloomberg Law) that it only heard about the ruling, which was handed down on August 1, when Apple made the announcement. It argued that the agency typically requires both sides to be heard before making such decisions and that Customs \"exceeded its authority.\" Masimo is now asking the court to put an injunction on UCBP's decision and, ultimately, to only allow imports of the devices if their blood oxygen-tracking function is disabled.\n\"Each passing day that this unlawful ruling remains in effect irreparably deprives Masimo of its right to be free from unfair trade practices and to preserve its competitive standing in the US marketplace,\" Masimo said.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wearables/masimo-files-lawsuit-over-apples-redesigned-blood-oxygen-monitoring-feature-130054895.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Chinese action camera (and now drone) company Insta360 has unveiled a premium addition to its lineup of compact cameras. The Insta360 GO Ultra is being billed as a new, more powerful product line in the GO series, instead of a replacement for the GO 3S.\nThis next generation represents a substantial step up in performance, powered by a new 5nm AI chip, which is a big jump from the 14nm chip found on the GO 3S. It also benefits from a larger 1/1.28-inch sensor, roughly twice the size of the one in the 3S. All of this unlocks better image quality with support for HDR, 4K capture at 60 fps and double the frame rate of the 3S. The Ultra also offers PureVideo, an enhancement that uses AI-powered algorithms to reduce noise and increase brightness in low-light captures.\nThe form factor for the Ultra is largely the same as the 3S, with a compact camera body that can be optionally housed in an Action Pod that offers additional battery life and a 2.5-inch flip touchscreen for live camera view. The Ultra weighs 53 grams (around 1.9 ounces), 14 grams more than the 3S, and sports a square body, as opposed to the pill-like shape of the 3S.\nThe slightly larger body means a 70-minute standalone battery life, which is just over 80 percent more than the 38 minutes on the 3S. The Action Pod extends this to 200 minutes. The Ultra also offers removable storage, expandable up to 2TB.\nLike most Insta360 cameras, much of the design is geared toward action shots for the more adventurous among us. The GO Ultra's IPX8 rating means it's waterproof down to 33 feet underwater. A magnetic clip system makes it easy to attach the GO Ultra to a piece of clothing or equipment and start capturing your adventure in 4K.\nThe Insta360 GO Ultra is available now worldwide for $450.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cameras/insta360-launches-new-action-camera-with-removable-storage-130019177.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Chinese regulators reportedly dissuaded local companies from purchasing NVIDIA's H20 chips, because they found certain statements by US commerce secretary Howard Lutnick \"insulting.\" According to the Financial Times, the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC), the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) and the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) teamed up to intensify their efforts to push the use of homegrown chips following Lutnick's remarks in an interview with CNBC. \nThe US, if you'll recall, blocked NVIDIA from selling its H20 chips to China back in April out of concern that the Chinese military would use them to develop AI technology. When the US government reversed its decision in July and allowed the company to start shipping its chips to China, Lutnick told CNBC: \"We don't sell them our best stuff, not our second best stuff, not even our third best. The fourth one down, we want to keep China using it... The idea is the Chinese are more than capable of building their own. You want to keep one step ahead of what they can build, so they keep buying our chips. You want to sell the Chinese enough that their developers get addicted to the American technology stack. That's the thinking.\" To note, a previous Times report stated that the government allowed NVIDIA to ship its products to China again after agreeing to hand over 15 percent of its profits.\nAs a response to Lutnick's remarks, the Times says Chinese authorities sought ways to prevent local companies from buying H20 chips. CAC issued an informal notice instructing China's biggest tech firms, such as ByteDance and Alibaba, to stop new orders for H20 chips until the government is done conducting a national security review. The companies are compelled to comply, because they could face substantial fines from the CAC if they don't. Meanwhile, NDRC also issued an informal notice, asking local tech companies not to purchase any NVIDIA chip. \nReuters recently reported that NVIDIA is developing a new chip for the Chinese market that's more powerful than the H20, perhaps driven in part by China's move to discourage its purchase. It will be based on the company's Blackwell architecture, but will only be capable of half the computing power of NVIDIA's Blackwell Ultra GPUs. Their regulatory and export approval aren't guaranteed, but the president previously implied that he was aware of the project and said he expects NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang to talk to him about it. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/china-reportedly-discouraged-purchase-of-nvidia-ai-chips-due-to-insulting-lutnick-statements-123055120.html?src=rss",

When the US government reversed its decision in July and allowed the company to start shipping its chips to China, Lutnick told CNBC: \"We don't sell them our best stuff, not our second best stuff, not even our third best. The fourth one down, we want to keep China using it... As a response to Lutnick's remarks, the Times says Chinese authorities sought ways to prevent local companies from buying H20 chips. CAC issued an informal notice instructing China's biggest tech firms, such as ByteDance and Alibaba, to stop new orders for H20 chips until the government is done conducting a national security review. The companies are compelled to comply, because they could face substantial fines from the CAC if they don't. Reuters recently reported that NVIDIA is developing a new chip for the Chinese market that's more powerful than the H20, perhaps driven in part by China's move to discourage its purchase. It will be based on the company's Blackwell architecture, but will only be capable of half the computing power of NVIDIA's Blackwell Ultra GPUs. Their regulatory and export approval aren't guaranteed, but the president previously implied that he was aware of the project and said he expects NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang to talk to him about it."

    "summary": "If you’ve been shocked by how much you spend on streaming services lately, you’re not alone. Companies like Netflix, Disney, Max and others have been consistently raising prices to the point where you may question if streaming is even worth it anymore. We at Engadget still think it is, but we also think you should be smart with your money — and that’s where streaming deals come in.\nYes, it is possible to get discounts on services like Peacock and Paramount+, even if those deals aren’t as common as a sale on AirPods. If you’re looking to save money and still stream all of the content you want, Engadget can help by laying out the best streaming deals you can get right now, how you can save with bundles and everything you should know before paying for yet another streaming service. \nBest streaming deals\nTrue streaming deals can be hard to come by. Most often, they’ll pop up during the Black Friday shopping period. On occasion, we’ll see them sparingly throughout the year and they usually take the form of a discounted monthly or annual rate for a limited period of time. Also, true streaming deals are typically on the ad-supported versions of a service, but once in a while you’ll find a unicorn of a deal on a tier that has ad-free viewing.\nIf you’re able to wait for a deal before subscribing to a streaming service, we recommend doing so. You’ll save money upfront and in the long run, and you also have the option to cancel your subscription before the price goes back up to the normal rate. Maybe you find you like the service so much that you’re fine paying full price for it — that’s the ideal situation. But if you’re not compelled to keep that app on rotation in your smart TV, most streaming services make it easy for you to cancel at any time. With that said, these are the best streaming deals you can snag right now.\n \nDirecTV starting at $50/month for one month ($35 off): All of DirecTV's signature packages are $35 off right now for your first month when you sign up. If you opt for the base \"Entertainment\" package, you'll spend $50 for the first month and get access to over 90 channels, including many local stations as well as ESPN, ESPN 2 and Fox Sports 1. You'll also be able to watch on the go with the DirecTV mobile app.\nDashPass Annual + HBO Max (with ads) for $96/year ($144 off): This offer includes access to HBO Max with ads for no extra cost when you sign up for a DashPass Annual plan. You can then decide to upgrade to Max Standard, which removes ads, for a discounted rate of $11 monthly if you want. Aside from the obvious streaming benefits, this deal gives you $0 deliver fees and lower service fees on some restaurant DoorDash orders, five percent DoorDash credits on pickup orders, on-demand grocery delivery and other members-only exclusives.\nSpotify Premium Individual (3 month) for $0 ($36 off): This is our favorite music streaming service for podcasts and social features. Right now, users who have not signed up for Spotify's Premium service before are eligible to get three months for free. The Premium Individual plan lets you listen ad-free and skip songs at will. You can also organize your listening queue and download content for offline listening. Just be aware, your subscription will auto-renew at the end of the trial period. So if you don't want to be on the hook for the $12 monthly fee, set a reminder to cancel and go back to the free version.\nFubo Pro for $55/month for the first month ($30 off): Fubo has introductory discounts on most of its packages, and the Pro package is the least expensive plan currently listed. It offers access to 224 channels, unlimited cloud DVR and up to 10 simultaneous streams. It even includes regional sports content from the NHL, MLB and NBA.\nYouTube TV (three months) for $150 ($99 off): You can get three months of our favorite live TV streaming service for $50 per month. That should give you a decent chunk of time to see if the service is right for you while saving some cash. The discount and trial are only open to new subscribers to YouTube TV’s base plan, which includes access to over 100 channels, unlimited DVR space and six household accounts with the ability to stream on three devices at once. \nSling Orange for $23/month for the first month (50 percent off): New customers can get Sling Orange or Sling Blue for half off the usual price for the first month, bringing the final prices to $23/month and $25.50/month, respectively. Orange is likely best for sports fans, with eight exclusive sports and family channels, while Blue includes 19 exclusive news and entertainment channels. You can get both Orange and Blue access also for half off for one month, or $33 total.\nPeacock first responders discount — one year for $48 (50 percent off): Medical professionals and first responders can save 50 percent each year of Peacock. The deal requires annual verification and is open to those who work for either private or public institutions. Peacock has some great stuff to watch, including Poker Face and Killing It and more.\nStudent discounts on streaming services\nHBO Max student discount — subscribe for $5/month (50 percent off): HBO Max offers their ad-supported tier to students for half off the usual rate. You’ll just have to verify that you’re a student through Unidays, and make note that this offer is only good for up to 12 months of service.\nHulu student discount — subscribe for $2/month (75 percent off): Those with a valid student ID can get Hulu’s ad-supported tier for 75 percent off the typical rate. They’ll keep the same sale price for as long as they’re a student as well.\nSpotify student discount — Premium + Hulu with ads for $6/month (72 percent off): Spotify’s student offer continues to be one of the best around, giving you access to the Premium tier of the music streamer and Hulu’s ad-supported plan for only $6 monthly. Purchased separately, you’d pay $22 per month for both of the services. Plus, the first month is free when you sign up.\nNBA League Pass student discount — one year for $120 (40 percent off): Students can get one year of League Pass for only $10 per month, which includes access to NBA TV and the ability to watch classic and archive games on-demand. On the NBA League Pass website, look for the student discount banner at the top and follow the instructions to verify your student status.\nStreaming bundle discounts\nThere’s more consolidation happening now than ever before in the streaming space, and that means there are more streaming bundle options. These bundles offer you access to more content with one subscription price, but those prices are typically higher than paying for a single service by itself (obviously). It may be tempting to just get the bundle, but if only one of those services in the bundle speaks to you, you’ll spend less overall by just paying for the single service.\nSpeaking of a deep love for a single streaming service: if all of your favorite shows are on Peacock or the latest releases on HBO Max consistently bring you joy, consider paying for one year upfront. Subscribing with an annual plan usually saves you money in the long term over paying on a monthly basis. Unfortunately, not all streaming services (looking at you, Netflix) have an annual subscription option. Here are some of the best streaming bundles you can get right now.\n \nDisney+, Hulu, HBO Max bundle with ads for $17/month: Ad-supported HBO Max is included here, along with full, ad-supported access to Disney+ and Hulu. You’ll save 43 percent with this bundle, as opposed to paying for all three services individually.\nDisney+ and Hulu Bundle Premium for $20/month: Disney and Hulu offer a few different bundles, which you can view in the drop-down lists under Choose Your Plan. This bundle removes the ads from both Disney+ and Hulu (with the exception of select live and linear content) and allows you to download content for offline viewing. You’ll save 42 percent with this bundle, as opposed to paying for both ad-free tiers individually.\nHulu + Live TV with Disney+ and ESPN+ for $96/month: This streaming bundle amalgamation is a bit confusing but it does offer a lot: you get live TV streaming via Hulu’s service plus access to the following VOD services: Hulu, Disney+ and ESPN+. Out of those three, only ESPN+ will have ads.\nDisney+, Hulu, ESPN+ Bundle Basic for $17/month: You get full access to Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+ content with this package, albeit with ads across the board. This bundle price is 46 percent off the total price of all three separate subscriptions.\nDisney+, Hulu, ESPN+ Bundle Premium for $27/month: Similarly to the Duo bundles, the Premium version of the Trio removes ads from most content in Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+, and you can download content for offline viewing. This price represents a 43-percent savings when compared to paying for all three ad-free tiers separately.\nSling TV + HBO Max starting at $53/month: Sling TV and HBO Max have partnered on a discount that gives new subscribers 50 percent off their first month of Sling TV, plus $5 off monthly when you subscribe to the Sling TV + HBO Max bundle. The standard price for the Sling Blue + HBO Max duo is roughly $58/month, so you'll get a monthly discount of $5 off that. In addition, for the first month only, you'll get half off the price of the bundle. The promotion also applies to the Sling Orange & Blue + HBO Max package, which has a standard price of $73/month.\nParamount+ with Showtime for $13/month or $120/year: This includes everything in Paramount+’s Essential plan, except the ads, and also provides access to Showtime content, live CBS streams and download features.\nRead more streaming coverage\n\nThe best live TV streaming services to cut cable\nThe best streaming services: Netflix, Hulu, HBO Max and more\nThe best streaming devices\n\nFollow @EngadgetDeals on X for the latest tech deals and buying advice.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/best-streaming-service-deals-133028980.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "In-flight internet is crappy, but more and more airlines think that Starlink is the solution. The latest company to sign with the SpaceX affiliate is Alaska Air Group, which announced that it will start offering Starlink Wi-Fi next year and expand the service to its entire fleet by 2027. \"With Starlink already live on [Alaska Air Group subsidiary] Hawaiian Airlines, we're proud that we'll offer... gate-to-gate connectivity on nearly every aircraft across both airlines,\" CEO Ben Minicucci said in a statement. \nThe company noted in a separate announcement that it will offer the perk for free to members of its new loyalty program called Atmos Rewards. T-Mobile, a partner with Alaska, will also offer a \"seamless, ad-free Wi-Fi log-on\" to the in-flight Starlink service, with more details to be announced later this year. Alaska Air touted the benefits of \"ultra-fast speeds... up to 7x faster than the geostationary satellite-based Wi-Fi systems that most airlines use today.\" \nOther airlines may jump on board soon, too. British Airways is also on the verge of announcing a Starlink deal, Bloomberg reported, and SpaceX has also reportedly been in conversation with Dubai's Emirates. Both of those are flagship carriers in their respective nations, so winning the business would be a large coup for Starlink against legacy operators like Viasat and Echostar. \nSwitching to Starlink isn't necessarily cheap, though. It reportedly costs around $300,000 to equip a 737 and around half a million to install the system on a 787 Dreamliner. On top of that, airlines pay around $120 monthly per seat, plus another $120 for live TV, according to Bloomberg's sources. (None of the airlines in negotiations have confirmed any details.)\nDespite those costs, carriers see reliable in-flight internet as a potential game-changer, as it would allow customers to work, communicate and stream videos or live TV. If the latter can be done reliably, it might even allow airlines to get rid of heavy and expensive on-demand entertainment systems. \nThe main downside for potential customers is SpaceX's owner, Elon Musk. Some may view his fractured relationship with US president Donald Trump as a negative, while end-users may be turned off by his political affiliations — something that has seemingly affected sales of his Tesla EVs of late. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/alaska-air-will-offer-starlink-in-flight-internet-starting-next-year-120023852.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Apple’s next big to-do for 2025 will be the upcoming iPhone 17 event, which will likely happen some time in September. Historically, the company uses those events to announce new iPhones, AirPods and Apple Watches — MacBooks tend to get their own, separate shindig (though we do expect the new macOS 26 software to come out around that time). For now, the most recent MacBooks are the M4 MacBook Air and the M4 MacBook Pro. Deciding between just two models may seem easy, but there are still plenty of variables to consider before you add one to your cart — screen size, chip capabilities, price and memory configurations will all come into play. We’ve reviewed every MacBook model to come out in the last 17 years or so, so we compiled this guide to help you pick the best MacBook for you.\nTable of contents\n\nBest MacBooks for 2025\nWhat about budget MacBooks?\nFactors to consider when buying a MacBook\nMacBooks specs comparison chart\nBest MacBook FAQs\n\nBest MacBooks for 2025\n \n \nWhat about budget MacBooks?\nHistorically, Apple kept the previous year’s MacBook Air in its lineup as a sort of budget option. But the company took a different approach with the release of the M4 MacBook Air. Instead of continuing to sell the older model, Apple discontinued the M3 Air and gave its newest computer a $100 price cut. \nNow, if you can even find a brand new M3 MacBook Air (typically from retailers like Amazon or B&H), it’s often more expensive than the M4 version. During sales like Amazon Prime Day, we’ve seen the newest M4 Air go for as little as $799. That effectively makes our overall pick a budget pick as well.\nOf course, $800 isn’t exactly a small investment either for college students or others on a budget. Especially when you can find some decent PCs for under $500. If you’re looking to save even more on a MacBook, we recommend checking out refurbished options directly from Apple, or even third party sellers like BackMarket. There are a few guidelines to keep in mind, which we go over in our refurbished guide, but mainly, you’ll want to shop from a reputable source that has a stated process and offers at least a year-long warranty. Using your old gear as a trade-in will bring down your final cost as well.\nFactors to consider when buying a MacBook\nCompared to PCs, Apple computers tend to have more streamlined specifications. The company has long been known for this simplicity, and the M-series “system-on-a-chip” condenses things even further. Prior to the M1 chip, Apple used Intel chips in its laptop and desktop computers. The M2 and M3 generations followed that first chip and currently sells MacBooks equipped with M4-series chips. You’ll find the standard M4 processor in the Air and the base-model Pro and the upgraded M4 Max and M4 Pro chips as options for the MacBook Pro (currently there is no M4 Ultra chip, as there was with the M3 series in the Mac Studio). All M-series chips combine, among other technologies, the CPU, graphics card and unified memory (RAM). Apple’s Neural Engine is included too, which is a specialized group of processor cores that handles machine learning tasks such as image analysis and voice recognition.\nWhile a unified chip means you have fewer decisions to make when picking a MacBook, there are still a few factors to consider, including specs like the number of CPU cores, amount of RAM, storage capacity, screen size, and, obviously, price. The finish color may be a minor consideration, but it's worth pointing out that the Pro comes in just two colors (Silver or Space Black) but the Air comes in four hues (Midnight, Starlight, Sky Blue and Silver).\nCPU cores\nThe lowest-specced chip in a current-lineup MacBook is the standard M4 chip, which is found in all models of the MacBook Air and the base model MacBook Pro 14-inch. That chip houses a 10-core CPU and either an 8- or 10-core GPU. In total, there are three versions of the M4 chip: standard M4, M4 Pro and M4 Max (which are each a step up from their predecessors, the M3, M3 Pro and M3 Max chips). The burliest chip, the M4 Max is built with either a 14- or 16-core CPU and a 32- or 40-core GPU. \nCores are, in essence, smaller processing units that can handle different tasks simultaneously. Having more of them translates to the computer being able to run multiple programs and applications at once, while also smoothly processing demanding tasks like video and photo editing and high-level gaming. In short, more cores allow for more advanced computing and better performance. But if your processing power needs fall below professional-level gaming and cinematic video and audio editing, getting the highest number of cores is likely overkill — and after all, more cores equals higher cost and more power usage.\n\n\n\n\n   Photo by Devindra Hardawar/Engadget \n \n\nRAM\nYour options for RAM, or in Apple’s terminology, unified memory, varies, but with the switch to the M4 chip in all laptops, the lowest amount of RAM you can get is now 16GB. That’s a necessary spec-bump to accommodate the tech world’s favorite feature of the moment: AI or, in this case, Apple Intelligence (still AI, but Cupertino’s version). The M4 Pro chip has 24 or 48GB memory options, while the M4 Max chip supports 48, 64 or a whopping 128GB of RAM.\nYou’ve likely heard the analogy comparing memory to the amount of workspace available on a literal desktop surface, whereas storage is the amount of drawers you have to store projects to work on later. The larger the worktop surface, the more projects you can work on at once. The bigger the drawers, the more you can save for later.\nIn addition to supporting Apple Intelligence, more RAM is ideal for people who plan to work in multiple apps at once. And the more demanding each program is, the more RAM will be required. Extra memory can also come in handy if you’re the type who likes to have infinite numbers of tabs open on your browser. If your daily workflow doesn’t involve simultaneously using a vast number of memory-intensive programs, you can save yourself money and buy the RAM configuration that you’re most likely to actually use.\nFor a long time, Apple continued to offer MacBooks with just 8GB of RAM, and we recommended upgrading to at least 16GB of RAM. With this being the standard today, grabbing a base model should be fine for most non-pro-level users. One thing to note is that, unlike most PCs, the RAM in a MacBook is not user-upgradable since it’s tied into the system-on-a-chip. If you think you might end up needing more memory, you should go for the spec upgrade up front.\nStorage capacity (SSD)\nStorage options range from 256GB of SSD for the base-model MacBook Air and 8TB of storage for the MacBook Pros with the M4 Max chip. If you want to rotate between a long roster of game titles or keep lots of high-res videos on hand, you’ll want more storage. If you’re mostly working with browser- and cloud-based applications, you can get away with a smaller-capacity configuration. That said, we recommend springing for 512GB of storage or more, if it’s within your budget. You’ll quickly feel the limits of a 256GB machine as it ages since the operating system alone takes up a good portion of that space. Having 1TB will feel even roomier and allow for more data storage over the life of your laptop.\nWhen Apple announced the iPhone 15, the company also announced new iCloud+ storage storage plans, with subscriptions that allow up to 12TB of storage shared among your iOS and MacOS devices. You could also transfer files to an external storage device. But if you don’t want to pay for a monthly subscription and prefer the convenience of having immediate access to your files, it’s best to get the highest amount of storage space your budget allows for at the outset.\nScreen size\nThe MacBook Air comes in 13- or 15-inch sizes. Pro models have either 14- or 16-inch screens. A two-inch delta may not seem like much but, as Engadget’s Nathan Ingraham noted when he reviewed the then-new 15-inch M2-powered MacBook Air, a larger screen \"makes a surprising difference.” That’s especially true if you plan to use your laptop as an all-day productivity machine and won’t be using an external monitor. More space means you can more clearly view side-by-side windows and have a more immersive experience when watching shows or gaming.\nBut screen size is one of the main factors influencing weight. The 13-inch MacBook Air M4 weighs 2.7 pounds, whereas the top-end 16-inch MacBook Pro with the Max chip weighs 4.7 pounds. If you plan to travel a lot or swap your work locations regularly, a smaller screen will make life easier in the long run.\nAll MacBooks feature IPS LCD panels (in-plane switching, liquid crystal display), which Apple markets as Retina displays. The MacBook Air M4 has a Liquid Retina display and the Pro models have Liquid Retina XDR displays. “Liquid” refers to the way the lighted portion of the display “flows” within the contours of the screen, filling the rounded corners and curving around the camera notch. “XDR” is what Apple calls HDR (high dynamic range).\nYou also get the option of a standard or nano-texture display on the MacBook Pro. The glass, which reduces glare and is also available on the Studio Display, iMac and iPad Pro, comes with a $150 price increase, but if you really don’t like reflections on your screen, it could be worth it.\nCompared to most other laptops, MacBook displays are notably bright, sharp and lush. But one feature worth pointing out is another Apple marketing term: ProMotion. It’s the company’s term to describe a screen with a higher, 120Hz refresh rate, which results in smoother scrolling and more fluid-looking graphics. Only MacBook Pros offer ProMotion; the Air maxes out at 60Hz, which is perfectly fine for everyday browsing and typical workdays. But if you want buttery-smooth motion from your display, you’ll have to shell out more money for an upgrade.\nOperating systems\nSoftware considerations won’t make much of a difference when deciding between MacBook models — all come with macOS installed. But if you’re switching from, say, a Windows PC, the operating system may be something to factor into your decision — though it’s probably less of an issue than it once was. Now that so much of the work we do on our computers is browser- and cloud-based, the learning curve between the two platforms isn’t as steep. Apps and programs like Gmail perform similarly regardless of what computer you’re using. Apple machines have historically had more limited support of AAA gaming titles, but even that is changing with more AAA games and better graphics coming to Macs.\nAs for macOS, it’s getting better too. With macOS Tahoe 26, the Spotlight function is more advanced, making it easier to find apps and perform tasks straight from your keyboard. The software also implements Apple's unifying Liquid Glass design for a modern look that looks consistent across iOS and iPad devices. New enhanced iPhone continuity features also make MacBooks and the handset work better together. A revamped Shortcuts app is more powerful as well, giving users custom automations that leverage Apple Intelligence (the company’s own AI).\nPrice\nWhen Apple announced the MacBook Air M4, it also delivered a bit of refreshing news: The latest model now starts $100 cheaper than the previous generation. So now, the least expensive MacBook is the 13-inch, M4-powered Air with 16GB of RAM and 256GB of storage for $999. Alternatively, you can spend up to $7,349 for the 16-inch MacBook Pro M4 Max with the nano-texture glass, 128GB of RAM and 8TB of storage. \nChip type, screen size, memory and storage capacity all influence the final price, which is why guides like this can help you determine just what you need (and what you don’t) so you can get the most cost-effective machine for you. AppleCare is another cost to consider. The extended warranty plan from Apple covers repairs from accidents and offers free battery replacement and starts at $3.50 per month or $35 per year for MacBooks. \nWe recommend the MacBook Air M4 for most people, and thanks to that $100 price cut, it’s also a good budget option. If you want something even cheaper, we recommend looking at refurbished M-series models from Apple. We think the 14- or 16-inch MacBook Pros are best for professionals. If you have extra money to spare once you’ve picked your machine, we recommend upgrading to at least 512GB of storage to make your machine as future-proof as possible. Of course, if you're just after the M4 chip and want the cheapest route to get it, you might consider the M4 Mac mini, which starts at $599 (though you'll have to supply the screen, mouse and keyboard).  \nBest MacBooks spec comparison chart\n\n\n\nProduct \nSuperlative \nTested configuration \nTested battery life \nRated battery life \n\n\nApple MacBook Air M4 (13-inch) \nBest MacBook overall \nApple M4, 16GB RAM, 256GB SSD \n18.25 hours \nUp to 18 hours \n\n\nApple MacBook Pro M4 (14-inch) \nBest MacBook for creatives \nApple M4, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD \n34.25 hours \nUp to 22 hours \n\n\n\nBest MacBook FAQs\nWhat's the difference between MacBook Air and Pro?\nBoth the MacBook Air and Pro models come with the M4 chip. MBP models have the option of more powerful M4 Pro or M4 Max chips. The Pro has a higher resolution screen with a higher peak brightness that supports up to 120Hz adaptive refresh rates and XDR (extreme dynamic range). The battery life on most Pro models is longer than on the Air models as well. Pro models also have more ports and more speakers. In short, the MacBook Air is aimed at everyday users looking for good productivity and entertainment capabilities, while Pro models are aimed at professionals who need a high-performance computer.\nWhat's the difference between macOS and Windows?\nMacOS is the operating system developed by Apple and used in all of its desktop and laptop computers. It can only be found in hardware made by Apple including MacBooks and iMacs. Microsoft’s Windows operating system can be found in the company’s own Surface laptops as well as computers made by a wide array of manufacturers, like Acer, Asus, Dell and Razer.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/best-macbook-140032524.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "With August already two-thirds out the door, it means we're getting closer to the Apple iPhone event, which typically takes place in September. During that event, we'll finally get to put our eyes on the iPhone 17 lineup. The latest iOS 26 features will come preinstalled on the new models, as well as any additional features Apple reveals at the launch event. But since we still have to wait a few weeks (presumably) until the iPhone event, we can at least speculate what the new phones will look like. As with most unreleased iPhone models, rumors and leaks have trickled in about the hardware side ahead of the official introduction. Here's what we're expecting and what we can reasonably assume we'll get from Cupertino in September.\nWhat are the latest iPhone 17 rumors?\nCould new \"TechWoven\" cases be introduced with the latest iPhone 17 lineup? That's what leaker Majin Bu claims, per a MacRumors report. The cases match the rumored design on the iPhone 17 models, with the wide camera bump. MacRumors says this could be a revamped version of the much-maligned FineWoven case, which was discontinued due to being susceptible to scratches and stains.\nHere are the new TechWoven Cases for iPhone 17Full Article: https://t.co/UGMdYQWPJX pic.twitter.com/BftqiD03jO— Majin Bu (@MajinBuOfficial) August 20, 2025\n\nThe leaker noted there are two lanyard holes for \"convenient and secure carrying,\" so it could be worn around your neck.\nThis is just a rumor and we won't know what the actual iPhone 17 models or accessories will look like until Apple's iPhone event next month. That said, the shared photos (including the one embedded above) are more convincing than usual.\nHow much will the iPhone 17 cost?\nApple's announced plan to expand US-based manufacturing partners seems to give it at least some shielding from the steepest Trump administration tariffs that have already triggered price increases on everything from Switch consoles to high-end cameras to Sonos speakers. But given that President Trump's trade policies can change from week to week, and Apple's continuing reliance on Asia-based supply chains, price shocks remain an ongoing possibility. The bigger question is: Will Apple absorb any higher costs, or pass them on to consumers? \nIf prices do creep up, Apple may choose to pair it with an \"upgrade.\" Consider this recent rumor posted by MacRumors from a leaker known as \"Instant Digital,\" suggesting that the default storage of the iPhone 17 line may start at 256GB, doubling the current 128GB baseline. While that could be accompanied by a price increase of $50, Apple could at least pitch it as a \"better value.\" That said, the company doubled the default RAM of its Mac computers from 8GB to 16GB at no extra cost in 2024 — but that was before the current Trump tariff cycle started.\nWhen will the iPhone 17 series be announced?\nMost years, the flagship smartphones are introduced in September. MacRumors highlighted a story originally reported by iphone-ticker.de that the Apple iPhone 17 event could be Tuesday, September 9, according to information gleaned from German mobile phone providers.\nIt's still too early to have the specific dates; some years, Apple only gives a week or two of lead time between sending invites and hosting the event. But years of past precedent show that sometime in September should be when the 17 models make their debut. This family of smartphones may be the last to follow that trend, however. There have been hints that the introduction of the iPhone 18 collection in 2026 will be split into a pro-tier announcement in the fall and a standard model announcement the following spring.\nWhat will the new iPhone 17 lineup include?\nDesign leaks suggest that Apple is building an ultra-thin smartphone, likely to be named the iPhone 17 Air to match Apple's ultralight laptop designation. Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, often a solid source of advanced intel about Apple, reported in January that the iPhone 17 Air will be equipped with a basic A19 chip and will only have a single camera lens. It may also use Apple's new in-house modem, which was introduced in February on the iPhone 16e. More details about this development may leak ahead of September, but that's what we know for now.\nAn investor note from Apple analyst Jeff Pu indicated that the Air will have a titanium frame. If his reports are accurate, the lightweight smartphone will be the only entry in the iPhone 17 lineup to use that metal; the iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone 17 Pro Max are expected to be made of aluminum, which is oddly a lighter material than titanium. Other speculation had suggested that the Air would use a blend of aluminum and titanium, so the exact materials may not be known until the official announcement.\nAdditionally, an August 4 MacRumors report says the internal battery pack of the iPhone Air is just 2.49mm thick — half the thickness of the iPhone 17 Pro battery. The leak was posted on the Korean-language Naver blog, where they show the alleged batteries of the iPhone 17 Air and 17 Pro side by side. The same account claimed the 17 Air's battery capacity was a mere 2,800 mAh, MacRumors notes. (That's below the battery capacity of current iPhone 16 models.)\nOn a similar topic, an iPhone 17 Pro production leak appears to have revealed an all-aluminum chassis, according to MacRumors. Originally posted by leaker Majin Bu, the image shows a shell that has a large round hole on the back (where the Apple logo typically is) to allow for MagSafe charging. MacRumors says this could just be a molding but notes that the aluminum frame (versus the current titanium in Pro iPhone models) would yield a significantly lower weight.\nThat same leaker (Majin Bu), whom MacRumors classifies as a \"hit-or-miss leaker,\" suggests the iPhone 17 Pro will have better wireless signal strength thanks to an updated antenna design. The individual posted a render on X that shows a new antenna system that wraps around the iPhone 17 Pro's supposedly wider rear camera bump. Again, this is a render, not a real-world photo. That said, we can't knock the goal of better wireless reception, so we're hoping this one has a degree of truth to it.\nEach new roster includes a base model, but over the years, Apple has shaken up the variety of phones it offers. Most likely there will be an iPhone 17 and an iPhone 17 Pro. Apple has also committed to the size matters philosophy, and has been building an iPhone Pro Max option with an even bigger screen and better battery life; the 17 roster will almost certainly have one as well. \nThe new Pro iPhones are said to have a full-width \"camera island\" on the rear, which would mark the first time an Apple model opted for that design. This feature can be seen in the purported iPhone 17 \"spotted in the wild.\" The pics, highlighted on MacRumors, show a black cased iPhone (17 Pro?) with the distinct back panel. Is it the real deal? The dual angles lend a degree of credibility in a social media landscape increasingly polluted with AI-enhanced fakes, but your guess is as good as ours.\nI just spotted a test development iPhone in the wild 🤩🤩🤩 pic.twitter.com/iS3PtKWqxJ— Fox Pupy 🦊🧡 (@Skyfops) July 28, 2025\n\nThe iPhone 17 Air seems primed to take the place of a potential iPhone 17 Plus. Since the iPhone 16e was only just introduced in February at a surprisingly high price point, it seems unlikely that there will be a new addition to that lower end of the spectrum, the models that were previously called SE. \nAt the very least, it sounds like the iPhone 17 Air won't take away the charging port and rely only on wireless connectivity. Bloomberg said that while Apple had investigated making the iPhone 17 Air without a single port, the company (fortunately) changed plans. He also says that the rumored phone will have a 6.6-inch screen and include the Dynamic Island and Camera Control button. Finally, the price is rumored at $900 — likely more than the standard iPhone 17 but less than the Pro.\nWe've also gotten what seems to be a reliable look at what the color lineup will be for the new smartphones. Macworld reported that the iPhone 17 will be available in black, white, steel gray, green, purple and light blue. The iPhone 17 Air will reportedly have four color options: black, white, light blue and light gold. While the Air colors will be less saturated, the visuals for the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max will go bold. The options for the Pro models are expected to be black, white, gray, dark blue and orange.\nOn July 30, Tom's Guide highlighted an X post from Sonny Dickson — a longtime and generally reliable leaker of unreleased iPhone information — showing \"dummy\" iPhone 17 models in the new colors that were the source of the aforementioned Macworld story. While these are literally just mock-ups — not real, leaked iPhones — it's interesting to see how the design and color rumors translate into a real-world look and feel.\nTo add the the rumors, a Weibo leaker known as Digital Chat Station suggests the iPhone 17e will come equipped with a new design that includes the Dynamic Island, MacRumors reports. According to the post, the new phone will have the A19 chip and could have a 6.1-inch OLED display with a front-facing 12-megapixel camera and a rear-facing 48-megapixel camera. However, it's important to note this report refers to the 17e model that would be expected to launch no earlier than February 2026, if it followed the same release pattern as the iPhone 16e.\nWhat will iOS 26 be like?\nApple upended its numbering conventions with WWDC 2025, and will match the name of each new operating system to the year it's released. So when the next wave of iPhones hits, they'll be running on iOS 26.\nOn the design side, the smartphone OS introduced during the big developer showcase took a contentious approach dubbed Liquid Glass. Apple has been scaling down the amount of transparency effects in the subsequent beta tests of iOS 26, but it will still have a glass-like visual.\nThe feature list includes big and small updates. On the more impactful side, the Phone and Photos apps have been redesigned. There will be several features leveraging artificial intelligence, such as live translation capabilities coming to Phone, FaceTime and Messages. Apple is also currently testing a sensitive content warning for child accounts that will freeze FaceTime video if nudity is detected by on-device machine learning tools. And the company is also launching Visual Intelligence, which will use AI to search for elements in an image.\niOS 26 also has a litany of minor, quality of life improvements. Group texts are getting support for polls. And for the slow risers out there, iOS 26 will finally let you escape the tyranny of the nine minute snooze alarm. \nThe next iOS is now available as a public beta. Here are our initial impressions of the Liquid Glass design and other new features. iOS 26 is compatible with all models back through iPhone 11.\nWhat other products are expected to be released alongside the iPhone 17?\nIf Apple follows its usual pattern, the iPhone 17 will be announced alongside new Apple Watch products. That would be the Apple Watch Series 11 (if Apple sticks to the same naming scheme), and maybe an Apple Watch Ultra 3 and/or an updated Apple Watch SE. (They'll all run watchOS 26, of course.) Other possibilities — and this is, again, speculation — could include refreshed Apple AirPods Pro (which received its last big update in 2022) and maybe new AirTags trackers (first released in 2021).\nThe Apple rumor mill got a big shot in the arm this week thanks to the reported inclusion of product ID numbers in recent beta software builds. Per MacRumors, it's a laundry list of new hardware, including long-rumored product updates like the Apple TV, HomePod mini, new Apple Studio Display monitor and two fresh iPads. \nOf course, even if that list is totally accurate, we may not see those products until 2026 — if ever. So don't expect all of products to share the stage with the iPhone 17, especially since Apple likes to keep its star performer at the center of attention. \nThat said, keep in mind that Apple has recently been having Mac-centric announcements in late October (as it did last year to debut new M4 Macs), so there's always the chance of another shoe dropping a few weeks down the road.  \nUpdate, August 20, 2025, 7:12PM ET: Added new rumor about potential TechWoven case for iPhone 17 series.\nUpdate, August 18, 2025, 6:23PM ET: Added new rumor about the iPhone 17e potentially having the Dynamic Island.\nUpdate, August 15, 2025, 2:05PM ET: Added new rumor about the all-aluminum chassis on the iPhone 17.\nUpdate, August 13, 2025, 10:02PM ET: Added a list of the products that are expected to be released alongside the iPhone 17s. \nUpdate, August 11, 2025, 7:27PM ET: Added a render of a rumored new antenna design for the iPhone 17 Pro.\nUpdate, August 8, 2025, 4:43PM ET: Added new speculation and reports about iPhone 17 pricing.\nUpdate, August 6, 2025, 4:05PM ET: Added latest details about the potential iPhone 17 event date.\nUpdate, August 4, 2025, 5:23PM ET: Added latest battery leaks about the iPhone 17 models.\nUpdate, August 1, 2025, 8:15AM ET: Added new photos showing potential iPhone 17 colors.\nUpdate, July 30, 2025, 11:08AM ET: Added latest leaks and rumors about the iPhone 17, and updated information on the iOS 26 public beta.\nUpdate, July 17, 2025, 4:40PM ET: Added latest information about iOS 26, possible materials for the Air, and the color options for the different models.\nUpdate, March 17, 2025, 2PM ET: Added details about the rumored price and features of the iPhone 17 Air.\nUpdate, April 11, 2025, 3:45PM ET: Added details from Front Page Tech's new video that claims to reveal details from a leaked iOS 19 build.\nKatie Teague contributed to this story.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/apple-iphone-17-launch-date-is-rumored-for-september-everything-to-know-about-the-newest-lineup-153024220.html?src=rss",

That said, keep in mind that Apple has recently been having Mac-centric announcements in late October (as it did last year to debut new M4 Macs), so there's always the chance of another shoe dropping a few weeks down the road."

    "summary": "Liquid Glass is a huge new change coming to iOS 26. (Apple)\nIn just few weeks, Apple's annual iPhone event will likely be upon us, which means we'll finally get a look at the newest iPhone 17 lineup. In addition, the company will also give us an official date for downloading iOS 26. Until that happens, you can download and install the newly released public beta 4 (or iOS 26 developer beta 7 for developers). I've been playing around with it for the past couple of weeks, and have found that taking screenshots is way better in the new operating system — Google and ChatGPT search options are now in the screenshots editor, for instance. You can see a more complete view of the new features in our preview of the iOS 26 public beta release, which shows off the fresh home and lock screen redesign. Called Liquid Glass, the new translucent look will extend across all of Apple's upcoming operating systems. The overhaul is one of several big changes coming to iOS, macOS, iPadOS and the rest of Apple's software suite, all of which were showcased during the company's WWDC keynote on June 9.\nAfter overpromising on AI plans last year, Apple kept its iOS roadmap focused more on basic quality of life improvements this year. There are multiple useful additions coming to the Phone and Messages apps on your iPhone, for instance: Apple execs outlined the ability to weed out spam texts or other unknown senders and an option to hold your spot on a phone call when you've been waiting for a representative to pick up. Plus, a treasured feature that we took for granted is coming back (hint: it's in the Photos app).\nSiri, meanwhile, is in a holding pattern. Apple has previously specified that its smarter voice assistant — first promised at WWDC 2024 — is delayed until some point \"in the coming year,\" so you shouldn't expect any major changes in the current betas. But there are reports that Apple is aiming to give Siri a bigger brain transplant by basing it on third-party artificial intelligence models like OpenAI's ChatGPT or Anthropic's Claude, which could make 2026 a pivotal year. The company is also reportedly working on a 'stripped-down' AI chatbot to rival ChatGPT.\nWith each beta, it seems like additional new improvements are popping up, like this new AirPods gesture we're all curious about, and this FaceTime feature that'll freeze your video if it detects nudity. With the release of the iOS 26 developer beta 5, we saw more added features, like a new bouncy animation on the passcode screen and in the Control Center, MacRumors reports. Some or all of those changes will likely soon migrate into the separate public beta (see below). Most newer iPhone models are eligible to download iOS 26 (both the betas and final version). Want to see the full list of new features coming this fall? Read on. \nWhat is iOS 26?\nThe current iPhone operating system is iOS 18, and Apple is still actively updating it — version 18.6.1 was released to restore Apple Watch blood oxygen monitoring functionality for certain users in the US. More recently, Apple released 18.6.2 to address a vulnerability related to image processing. But don't expect to see iOS 19 soon — or ever. Instead, Apple is skipping the numbering ahead to iOS 26 later this year. The company has decided to line up its iOS version numbers with a year-based system, similar to car model years. So while iOS and its sibling operating systems will be released in late 2025, they're all designated \"26\" to reflect the year ahead. \nIt's official, we're moving to iOS 26. (Apple)\nWhat is Liquid Glass design?\nLet's be honest. Out of everything announced at WWDC this year, the new Liquid Glass design was the star of the show. The iPhone's home and lock screens have looked pretty much the same year after year — the last exciting thing (in my opinion) was the option to add your own aesthetic to your home screen by customizing your apps and widgets. So seeing the home and lock screens' new facelift is refreshing.\nSo what exactly is Liquid Glass? Apple calls it a \"new translucent material\" since, well, the apps and widgets are clear. However, the screen can still adapt to dark and light modes, depending on surroundings. You'll also notice buttons with a new floating design in several apps, like Phone and Maps. They're designed to be less distracting than the current buttons, but are still easy to see. While the design overhaul has proven to be controversial since its announcement, some — including Engadget's own Devindra Hardawar — like the new direction, even if it's somewhat reminiscent of Microsoft's translucent Windows Vista Aero designs from nearly twenty years ago.\nThat said, as of the release of the iOS 26 beta 2, Apple has already incorporated some user feedback into the design, dialing back the transparency in at least some places. And while it will continue to evolve, Apple users won't be able to escape it: Liquid Glass was designed to make all of Apple's OSes more cohesive. Here's a look at how the translucent aesthetic will look with the new macOS Tahoe 26 on your desktop.\nWhat are the new and notable features of iOS 26?\niOS 26 has a laundry list of new features. Among the most worthwhile:\nPhone app redesign: You'll finally be able to scroll through contacts, recent calls and voicemail messages all on one screen. It also comes with a new feature called Hold Assist that'll notify you when an agent comes to the phone so you can avoid the elevator music and continue on with other tasks.\nLive Translation in Phone, FaceTime and Messages: iOS 26 is bringing the ability to have a conversation via phone call or text message with someone who speaks another language. Live Translation will translate your conversation in real time, which results in some stop-and-go interactions in the examples Apple shared during its presentation.\nPolls in group chats: Tired of sorting through what seems like hundreds of messages in your group chat? You and your friends will soon be able to create polls in group messages for deciding things like which brunch spot you're eating at or whose car you're taking on a road trip.\nFiltering unknown senders in Messages: If you haven't received spam texts about unpaid tolls or other citations, you're lucky. For those of us who have, those annoying messages will soon be filtered away in a separate folder.\nVisual Intelligence: Similar to a reverse Google image search, this new feature will allow you to search for anything that's on your iPhone screen. For instance, if you spot a pair of shoes someone is wearing in an Instagram photo, you can screenshot it and use Visual Intelligence to find those shoes (or similar ones) online.\nPhotos tabs are back: For anyone who's still frustrated with the Photos changes made last year, you'll be happy to know that your tabs are coming back. Library and Collections will have their own separate spaces so you don't have to scroll to infinity to find what you're looking for.\nFaceTime \"Communication Safety\" feature: A newer addition to iOS 26 appears to be the FaceTime \"Communication Safety\" feature that pauses communications if and when nudity is detected. The feature appears to be a child safety feature that uses on-device detection, thus obviating any cloud-based privacy issues. \nNew lock screen options: The iPhone lock screen gets more customizable in iOS 26, with a cooler clock, 3D wallpaper effects, more widgets and better focus mode options. \nApple's Hold Assist will be nifty for those pesky services that put you on hold for 10 or more minutes. (Apple)\nNew changes coming to iPadOS 26\nYour iPad isn't getting left behind when it comes to big updates. Here's what's coming this fall.\nMultitasking and real windowing: When you download the newest update, you'll be able to have multiple apps running on your screen at the same time. Once you open an app, it'll appear on your screen as normal but you'll be able to resize and move it across your screen to make room for other apps. This feature is optional so you can turn it off if you don't like it.\nVisual update: Along with the other new OSes, iPadOS 26 is coming with the Liquid Glass aesthetic. This new look will appear on the lock and home screens, as well as the drop-down menus.\nNew menu bar: When you swipe down on your screen, the new menu bar will appear with options like File, Edit, Windows and more. There's also a search option if you're looking for something specific.\nCheck out our first impressions of iPadOS 26. \nWhat about AirPods?\nAirPods are also getting updated with iOS 26. Here are some of the more notable functions.\nEnhanced audio recording: Apple calls this \"studio-quality\" audio recording, and with it, you'll notice more clarity while in noisy environments.\nCamera remote control: Using this, you can take a photo or start and stop video recording with just one press on your AirPods. When taking photos, you'll get a three-second countdown before your iPhone or iPad snaps the picture.\nLive translation feature: While not officially announced or confirmed, it appears that the long-rumored live translation for AirPods could be coming with iOS 26. The evidence comes from a system asset spotted in the in iOS 26 beta showing a gesture that's triggered by pressing both earbud stems at the same time. The photo also shows words in several different languages. \nWhich iPhones will be able to upgrade to iOS 26?\nA few iPhone models that run the current version of iOS — iPhone XR, XS and XS Max — won't be compatible with the latest upgrade. But any iPhones released in 2019 or later will be eligible for the iOS 26 update.\n\niPhone SE (second generation or later)\niPhone 11\niPhone 11 Pro\niPhone 11 Pro Max\niPhone 12\niPhone 12 mini\niPhone 12 Pro\niPhone 12 Pro Max\niPhone 13\niPhone 13 mini\niPhone 13 Pro\niPhone 13 Pro Max\niPhone 14\niPhone 14 Plus\niPhone 14 Pro\niPhone 14 Pro Max\niPhone 15\niPhone 15 Plus\niPhone 15 Pro\niPhone 15 Pro Max\niPhone 16\niPhone 16 Plus\niPhone 16 Pro\niPhone 16 Pro Max\niPhone 16e\n\nNot listed here are the presumed new iPhone 17 models (or maybe iPhone 26?) that are all but certain to be announced and released in September. \nHow to install iOS 26 beta\nThe iOS 26 public beta is now available to download via the Apple Beta Software Program. If you're not already a member, you'll need to sign up to try out all the latest features. Just visit beta.apple.com and sign up with your phone number or email address. It's free.\nOnce you're in, you can install it by going to Settings > General > Software Update and selecting iOS 26 public beta. \nA word of caution: Don't sign up with your main iPhone unless you're OK with any risks that occur with using an OS that isn't finalized.\nWhen will the final version of iOS 26 be released?\niOS 26 will be released to the public this fall. It usually comes in September, within a week of the Apple iPhone event. Last year, it rolled out to iPhone users on September 16 — exactly one week after the iPhone 16 lineup was announced.\nIf you're more interested in the Apple Intelligence features coming, here's everything Apple revealed for iOS, macOS and more during WWDC. Also, check out how iOS 26 screenshots could be an intriguing preview of Apple's delayed Siri rework.\nUpdate, August 20: Noted that iOS 26 public beta 4 and iOS 18.6.2 are now available to download.\nUpdate, August 18: Added details about a potential iOS 18.6 update.\nUpdate, August 15: Added to link to what to expect at the Apple iPhone event and details about what's available in the iOS 26 screenshots editor.\nUpdate, August 13: Added new AirPods detail spotted in the iOS 26 beta.\nUpdate, August 11: Noted that iOS 26 developer beta has hit beta 6. \nUpdate, August 8: Added new features coming with iPadOS 26 and AirPods.\nUpdate, August 6: Noted the release of iOS 26 beta 5 and the new bouncy feature on passcode screen and Control Center.\nUpdate, August 4: Noted that Apple is reportedly working on a ChatGPT rival.\nUpdate, August 1: Added quote from Tim Cook about iOS 26.\nUpdate, July 31: Noted that iOS 18.6 is now available. \nUpdate, July 24: Noted the iOS 26 public beta is now available.\nUpdate, July 3: Noted new FaceTime feature found in the developer beta.\nUpdate, June 30: Noted ongoing iOS 18 releases, and reports that Apple is considering additional external LLMs for Siri. \nUpdate, June 25: Noted changes added in iOS 26 beta 2. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/ios-26-public-beta-4-is-here-everything-to-know-about-apples-big-software-changes-coming-to-iphone-and-ipad-135749840.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Welcome to Video Games Weekly on Engadget. Expect a new story every Monday or Tuesday (or Wednesday, whatever), broken into two parts. The first is a space for short essays and ramblings about video game trends and related topics from me, Jess Conditt, a reporter who's covered the industry for more than 13 years. The second contains the video game stories from the past week that you need to know about, including some headlines from outside of Engadget.\nPlease enjoy — and I'll see you next week.\n\nOn a planet shrouded in myth, in a land surrounded by lore, on a mountain draped in mystery, in a cave suffocated by secrets, the legend sleeps. For six years, the legend has slumbered while wild stories spiral around it, twisting and expanding and entwining. New words have been born and old words infused with evolved meanings: Believer. Doubter. Silkpost. The lies have grown so thick they’ve become corporeal, spreading trickery with a name and a dead smile.For six years, the legend has slept while the masses roiled, all of them waiting for the signal to awaken and know truth. All of them waiting for a bell that will ring, finally and clearly, on Thursday, August 21, 2025.Skong. Skong. Skong.\nIt’s a special time in the Silksong subreddit. After years of silence around its sequel, Hollow Knight: Silksong, Team Cherry has scheduled a livestream with a “special announcement” about the game for August 21 at 10:30AM ET. Not only is this exciting for Metroidvania fans everywhere, but it’s also possible that this announcement marks the final moments of the Silksong subreddit as we know it. A strange cocktail of game delays, inconsistent updates and hyper-focused cult fandom has cultivated a fascinating little universe in r/Silksong, complete with its own rules, villains and heroes. It’s a place where clown wigs are commonplace and contributors have turned trolling into a role-playing artform. A LARPform, if you will. It’s a place that’s consistently made me laugh every time it’s appeared in my feed over the past year or so.\nAhead of Thursday’s special announcement, this sub is experiencing the last gasps of desperate myth-making and hopeless anticipation before it transforms into something else entirely, armed with actual information about the sequel, gameplay videos and maybe even a firm release date. Or, dare I say it, a surprise launch. For just a moment longer in r/Silksong, anything is possible.\nAnd then it’ll be over. No matter what happens during Thursday’s livestream, the day will come when Silksong comes out and the drip-feed of silkposts dries up completely. But for now, our face paint is ready. Sometimes it’s just nice to recognize the madness and the beauty of the moment, before it slips away for good.\nUpdate August 21, 11:30AM ET: It happened. Hollow Knight: Silksong is due out on September 4.\n\n\nThe news\nNews from ONL 2025\nGamescom 2025 kicked off on Tuesday with Opening Night Live, a showcase hosted by Geoff Keighley and the folks behind The Game Awards, and there were plenty of delightful morsels on display. Engadget UK Bureau Chief Mat Smith is on the ground at Gamescom in Cologne, Germany, to play upcoming titles and talk to developers, but for now, here are our headlines straight out of ONL 2025:\n\nDenshattack! is a blend of Tony Hawk, trains and shonen anime\nBattlestar Galactica might finally get the video game adaption it deserves\nAbsolum is awesome and I can't wait to play it on October 9\nCall of Duty: Black Ops 7 arrives on November 14\nFromSoft's Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice is becoming an anime\nFallout season two has a teaser trailer and a December 17 release date\nBlack Myth: Zhong Kui is the next title from Game Science Studio\nCult of the Lamb's next DLC is Woolhaven, out in early 2026\nIndiana Jones and the Great Circle is coming to the Switch 2\n\nAnd our headlines from Gamescom 2025 so far:\n\nOnimusha: Way of the Sword might be a more forgiving kind of samurai epic\nResident Evil Requiem feels very familiar, but it's so well made that I respect the hell out of it\nEngadget's Gamescom Opening Night Live 2025 liveblog\nHow to watch Gamescom 2025 and what to expect\n\nGamescom 2025 runs through August 24.\nROG Xbox Ally lands in October\nMicrosoft is slowly establishing its handheld era with news that the ROG Xbox Ally and ROG Xbox Ally X will be available on October 16. There’s still no official word on how much they’ll cost, but there are hints: As spotted by Wario64, Best Buy recently listed the Xbox Ally at $550 and the Xbox Ally X at $900, and these fall in line with our predictions, which were based on the prices of existing ROG Ally handhelds. Alongside the release date, Microsoft announced the Handheld Compatibility Program, an initiative aimed at optimizing games for portable devices and informing players about how well they perform. It’s essentially Steam Deck Verified, but for Xbox handhelds, and it’s yet another sign that Microsoft’s portable gaming ambitions stretch beyond just one hardware manufacturer.\nThe PS5 will cost more tomorrow than it does today\nFirst Nintendo and Microsoft raised the prices of their latest consoles, and now it’s Sony’s turn. Sony on Wednesday announced the following price increases for the PS5 family:\n\nStandard PS5 with a disc drive: $550, up from $500\nPS5 digital edition: $500, up from $450\nPS5 Pro: $750, up from $700\n\nSony blames the increases on a “challenging economic environment,” echoing sentiments from its contemporaries. The price hikes come at a time in the hardware generation when we’re used to seeing consoles get cheaper, which just makes this whole thing more frustrating.\nRod Fergusson is in charge of BioShock again and already making big changes\nThere have been signs of turmoil at BioShock 4 studio Cloud Chamber for a while now, including news earlier this month that the game failed a review with 2K executives and was due for a complete narrative revamp. Now, we’re seeing even more fallout. Former Gears of War and Diablo head Rod Fergusson has left Blizzard to lead development of BioShock 4 at Cloud Chamber, and his appointment comes alongside news that 80 people at the studio are being laid off. This is actually the second time Fergusson has joined the development of a BioShock game at the last second — he similarly swooped in and cut aspects of BioShock: Infinite at Irrational Games in 2012.\nThe race through development hell between Judas and BioShock 4 continues.\nBlizzard’s cinematic and narrative team is unionizing\nMicrosoft is the home of another video game union. Workers with Blizzard Entertainment’s Story and Franchise Development team, which handles in-game cinematics and lore for titles including Overwatch and World of Warcraft, voted this week to unionize under the Communications Workers of America. This covers about 169 developers and it marks the fourth unionization effort from Microsoft’s gaming teams, joining QA workers at Activision, ZeniMax and Raven Software.\nSteam censorship is breaking PayPal\nPayPal isn’t a valid way to buy games on Steam in certain countries any longer. Steam in July removed hundreds of games with adult and NSFW themes from its storefront, and updated its policies to ban \"content that may violate the rules and standards” of its payment processors. This was incredibly vague and raised immediate concerns around financial censorship, especially when combined with a related culling of thousands of games from Itch.io. Now, it’s confirmed that PayPal has terminated its partnership with Steam in multiple countries, affecting any denomination “other than EUR, CAD, GBP, JPY, AUD and USD.”\nValve says it’s being pressured by payment processors including Visa, MasterCard and PayPal to remove certain games and implement puritanical censorship policies, and this has already resulted in at least one game being unjustly removed from the platform.

    "full_text": "The first is a space for short essays and ramblings about video game trends and related topics from me, Jess Conditt, a reporter who's covered the industry for more than 13 years. After years of silence around its sequel, Hollow Knight: Silksong, Team Cherry has scheduled a livestream with a “special announcement” about the game for August 21 at 10:30AM ET. Not only is this exciting for Metroidvania fans everywhere, but it’s also possible that this announcement marks the final moments of the Silksong subreddit as we know it. Gamescom 2025 kicked off on Tuesday with Opening Night Live, a showcase hosted by Geoff Keighley and the folks behind The Game Awards, and there were plenty of delightful morsels on display. Alongside the release date, Microsoft announced the Handheld Compatibility Program, an initiative aimed at optimizing games for portable devices and informing players about how well they perform. Sony blames the increases on a “challenging economic environment,” echoing sentiments from its contemporaries. The price hikes come at a time in the hardware generation when we’re used to seeing consoles get cheaper, which just makes this whole thing more frustrating. Former Gears of War and Diablo head Rod Fergusson has left Blizzard to lead development of BioShock 4 at Cloud Chamber, and his appointment comes alongside news that 80 people at the studio are being laid off. This covers about 169 developers and it marks the fourth unionization effort from Microsoft’s gaming teams, joining QA workers at Activision, ZeniMax and Raven Software. PayPal isn’t a valid way to buy games on Steam in certain countries any longer."

    "summary": "We've heard a lot this year about AI enabling new scams, from celebrity deepfakes on Facebook to hackers impersonating government officials. However, a new report suggests that AI also poses a fraud risk from the other direction — easily falling for scams that human users are much more likely to catch.\nThe report, titled \"Scamlexity,\" comes from a cybersecurity startup called Guardio, which produces a browser extension designed to catch scams in real time. Its findings are concerned with so-called \"agentic AI\" browsers like Opera Neon, which browse the internet for you and come back with results. Agentic AI claims to be able to work on complex tasks, like building a website or planning a trip, while users kick back.\nThere's a huge problem here from a security perspective: while humans are not always great at sorting fraud from reality, AI is even worse. A seemingly simple task like summarizing your emails or buying you something online comes with myriad opportunities to slip up. Lacking common sense, agentic AI may be prone to bumbling into obvious traps.\nThe researchers at Guardio tested this hypothesis using Perplexity's Comet AI browser, currently the only widely available agentic browser. Using a different AI, they spun up a fake website pretending to be Walmart, then navigated to it and told Comet to buy them an Apple Watch. Ignoring several clues that the site wasn't legit, including an obviously wonky logo and URL, Comet completed the purchase, handing over financial details in the process.\nIn another test, the study authors sent themselves an email pretending to be from Wells Fargo, containing a real phishing URL. Comet opened the link without raising any alarms and blithely dumped a bank username and password into the phishing site. A third test proved Comet susceptible to a prompt injection scam, in which a text box concealed in a phishing page ordered the AI to download a file.\nIt's just one set of tests, but the implications are sobering. Not only are agentic AI browsers susceptible to new types of scam, they may also be uniquely vulnerable to the oldest scams in the book. AI is built to do whatever its prompter wants, so if a human user doesn't notice the signs of a scam the first time they look, the AI won't serve as a guardrail.\nThis warning comes as every leader in the field bets big on agentic AI. Microsoft is adding Copilot to Edge, OpenAI debuted its Operator tool in January, and Google's Project Mariner has been in the works since last year. If developers don't start building better scam detection into their browsers, agentic AI risks becoming a massive blind spot at best — and a new attack vector at worst.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/ai-browsers-may-be-the-best-thing-that-ever-happened-to-scammers-220315936.html?src=rss",

However, it said that's an intentionally conservative estimate, so this probably isn't a huge concern.\nThe postponement follows previous ones in March and July. (The last time was due to tariffs.) Analogue acknowledged the frustration pre-order customers must be feeling. \"We know this sucks,\" the Pocket maker wrote. \"Another delay, announced late, after months of patience.

    "summary": "The Qi2 wireless charging spec was originally announced back in early 2023. However, Android phone makers haven’t exactly been rushing to add Qi2 support to their latest devices since then. That’s made finding a compatible handset rather difficult, which is a bummer for anyone who has seen the wealth of accessories and power banks that iPhone owners have had access to for several generations.\nOn top of faster charging speeds (up to 25 watts or higher in later revisions), Qi2 dictates the inclusion of embedded magnets designed to make aligning and attaching peripherals a cinch.\nBut what makes the slow rollout a bit more frustrating is that Apple is a member of the Wireless Power Consortium (the governing body in charge of Qi2) and its MagSafe tech was used to help define the spec and ensure that compliant add-ons work seamlessly with Qi2, so it’s not like there’s a lack of compatible peripherals.\nRegardless, to help you figure out which Android phones officially come with Qi2, we’ve compiled a list of supported devices. (Note: Due to the complexities of the Chinese market, this list is primarily focused on gadgets available in North America and the EU.)\nAndroid phones with Qi2:\n\nThe HMD Skyline.\nThe Google Pixel 10 family.\n\nThat’s it, seriously. Though now this list does include one of the biggest Android phone makers in Google.\nThat said, there is one wrinkle with the Pixel 10 line. While Google's Pixelsnap standard is Qi2 compatible, wireless charging speeds for the base Pixel 10 and Pixel 10 Pro are staying the same at 15 watts. However, only the Pixel 10 Pro XL comes with support for the more powerful Qi2.2 spec which allows for wireless charging at up to 25 watts. So if you want the convenience of cable-free magnetic charging and want to do it as fast as possible, you're going to have to pay extra for the most premium version of the Pixel 10. \nThe status of other Android phone manufacturers\nBut what about the Galaxy S25? Unfortunately, despite Samsung saying that it will release multiple “Android devices supporting Qi2” this year, its latest batch of flagship phones (including S25 Edge, Galaxy Z Flip 7 and Galaxy Z Fold 7) are merely \"Qi2 ready.\" But what does that mean? Like previous models, the Galaxy S25 family can charge wirelessly at up to 15 watts. However, because the phones don't have magnets on their back, Qi2 accessories slide off when you try to attach them. This can be addressed by purchasing a compatible case with a built-in magnetic mounting system or a magnetic ring mount, but at least out of the box, the Galaxy S25 line requires additional assistance in order to work with the growing market of Qi2 peripherals.\nOnePlus also claims the OnePlus 13 supports Qi2. However, in our testing, the magnets inside the phone are so weak that it didn't latch on securely to any of the Qi2 accessories we tested. However, similar to the Galaxy S25, if you pair the OnePlus 13 with one of the company's magnetic cases, you can attach Qi2 peripherals as normal. \nFinally, when asked if it had plans to release Qi2-compatible phones, Motorola would only say that it is \"committed to bringing the latest technology across our devices.\"\nAs new phones with Qi2 hit the market, we will try to keep this list as up-to-date as possible. Or at least until the spec becomes a much more mainstream standard.\nUpdate, August 20 2025, 4:45PM ET: This story has been updated with info about Qi2 support on the Pixel 10 family. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/here-are-all-the-android-phones-that-support-qi2-150052702.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Microsoft is creating a new \"advanced shader delivery\" feature for the ASUS ROG Xbox Ally handhelds that might make loading games faster and more stutter-free. The company teased the upcoming feature alongside the announcement of the launch date for the first Xbox-branded handhelds and the company's new compatibility system for figuring out if games will run well on handhelds.\nShader stutter is a widespread issue in PC gaming that doesn't occur on consoles because of their uniform hardware. You have to download shaders for a PC game to make sure that they run correctly on your specific hardware. Typically, a game downloads shaders when they're first launched, which can add to the wait before you can actually start playing, and lead to things like framerate drops as shaders are compiled in the background. Microsoft's system \"preloads game shaders during download\" which the company says will allow games to launch up to 10 times faster, \"run smoother, and use less battery on first play.\"\nIt sounds like this new shader delivery system will require some amount of buy-in from developers, which means it likely won't impact every game at launch. It's just one of the ways Microsoft is trying to address the complexity and inefficiency Windows 11 can add to gaming. Besides including easier access to features like the Game Bar and ASUS' Armoury Crate software, the company also says that its handheld version of Windows will \"minimize background activity and defer non-essential tasks\" to devote more resources to playing games.\nMicrosoft wants theses handhelds to be a success, so it makes sense to put in the work. But in a world where Xbox home consoles look even more like Windows PCs, the company might also be making improvements now that it can take advantage of later.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/microsoft-is-working-on-a-fix-for-pc-shader-stutter-193616440.html?src=rss",

You have to download shaders for a PC game to make sure that they run correctly on your specific hardware. Typically, a game downloads shaders when they're first launched, which can add to the wait before you can actually start playing, and lead to things like framerate drops as shaders are compiled in the background. Microsoft's system \"preloads game shaders during download\" which the company says will allow games to launch up to 10 times faster, \"run smoother, and use less battery on first play.\" It sounds like this new shader delivery system will require some amount of buy-in from developers, which means it likely won't impact every game at launch. It's just one of the ways Microsoft is trying to address the complexity and inefficiency Windows 11 can add to gaming. Besides including easier access to features like the Game Bar and ASUS' Armoury Crate software, the company also says that its handheld version of Windows will \"minimize background activity and defer non-essential tasks\" to devote more resources to playing games. Microsoft wants theses handhelds to be a success, so it makes sense to put in the work. But in a world where Xbox home consoles look even more like Windows PCs, the company might also be making improvements now that it can take advantage of later."

    "summary": "For nearly 30 years, developer Capcom has been redefining its particular brand of survival horror for the Resident Evil series. Despite its tone shifting between action-horror games and more pure horror entries, where players face down grotesque moments with scant resources, the series still manages to place players in tense encounters that define the series' against-all-odds approach to horror. And with the upcoming Resident Evil Requiem — or RE9 — appears to continue the series' current momentum in delivering compelling horror experiences.\nJust ahead of Gamescom 2025, I got to experience the opening of Resident Evil Requiem, focusing on new protagonist Grace Ashcroft (daughter of Alyssa Ashcroft from Resident Evil Outbreak) and her desperate attempt at fleeing a horrifying clinic within a strange mansion. Capcom's return to traditional survival horror was one of the best games showcased at Summer Game Fest 2025, and spending more time with it recently made me appreciate the series' renewed vision — even if it's a bit familiar.\n\nMuch like recent core entries in the Resident Evil series — VII and Village — Resident Evil Requiem places a keen focus on immersion, truly capturing that sense of dread as you walk down the halls of an unnerving facility. The larger story of Requiem seems to be pointing towards a homecoming of sorts for the series' most pivotal event — the destruction of Raccoon City in Resident Evil 2 and 3. While Requiem's story will expand into a more ambitious scope, the demo I played focused on Grace's harrowing attempt to escape her abductors.\nIn this sequence, Grace frees herself from an inverted hospital gurney and finds herself trapped in a ruined clinic filled with the bodies of dead doctors. In keeping with the brand of horror from the Resident Evil 2 remake and Resident Evil Village, I was being stalked by an imposing, grotesque monster hiding in the ceilings. Without weapons and with only empty bottles for distractions and sources of light to keep the beast at bay, the sequence felt very much like a stealth puzzle sequence, where I had to examine the movements of the beast and figure out a way to maneuver around it.\nI had previously seen this particular sequence during Summer Game Fest 2025. While I was impressed with its presentation — which features some of the most impressive lighting and character rendering I've seen from Capcom's RE Engine — I found the premise and scenario to be somewhat too familiar than I would have liked. Since Resident Evil VII, the series has leaned heavily into putting players in the series' most vulnerable moments, which often entail being stalked by imposing foes without any means to defend oneself.\nCapcom\nThat sense of vulnerability can often feel played out, especially within the current horror game space, where running away from things is its sub-genre. However, getting to play Resident Evil Requiem properly made me appreciate Capcom's attempt to maintain the momentum from Resident Evil VII. And a lot of that had to do with the fact that Requiem now stars a more fully defined protagonist. Ethan Winters from VII and Village was a faceless protagonist with somewhat generic motivations, but he gradually became more well-rounded by the end of his story in Village. Now, with Grace, we're thrust into an unfamiliar situation, as she's more of an active participant in the story — talking to herself throughout the demo — and I felt a stronger connection to her sense of vulnerability as a protagonist.\nOne of my favorite moments from the preview came shortly after I encountered the monster for the first time. After evading it, I went to the clinic's waystation to find a tool to open a fuse box. As I was wheeling a cart over to an elevated toolbox, the creature came into the room. As I tried hiding behind the cart, the monster spotted me and smashed the cart into me, which sent Grace hurling back to the wall. The beast then grabbed Grace and took a giant bite out of her shoulder. I used up my only health item and fled the room, returning to the well-lit safe that started the preview. Once the monster was gone, I snuck back into the waystation to retrieve the item — but more carefully this time around. It was a scary moment, but still totally exciting, and it had me on edge for the rest of the preview.\nCapcom\nMuch like Resident Evil VII and Village, Requiem is by default a first-person game, which certainly creates a palpable sense of dread and uneasiness when exploring with a limited perspective. However, Requiem also adds the option to switch to third-person, which was introduced post-launch for Resident Evil Village and its DLC, Shadows of Rose. Having played the demo from both perspectives, I was impressed with how well the presentation feels tuned for both styles. The third-person perspective captures that sense of dread and adds in the expanded visibility, which gave me a clear and distressing view of the monster stalking me from behind as I ran towards the safe room.\nIn the final stretch of my preview, I had all the tools I needed to make my exit. However, the storm outside the building blew out the lights in the area, allowing the monster to give chase. This sprint to the finish was tense and riveting. Even having seen the demo hands-off months prior, playing the sequence on my own made for a captivating experience. Once Grace made her exit, she had one last confrontation with the monster before the demo came to an abrupt end.\nCapcom\nSo far, Resident Evil Requiem feels like a souped-up version of the immersive survival horror found in recent entries of the series — and it does very well based on this preview. I appreciated just how atmospheric this one, fairly limited, area of the preview was — seeing the long stretch of the hallway, with only my lighter and a dim red light illuminating in the distance, made for a striking visual — especially with the silhouette of the monster looming in the distance.\nThat said, as well made as these sequences were, I'm already looking forward to seeing what sort of other tricks and events Requiem has in store. While I was a bit mixed on Village's Resident Evil amusement park-style structure, I'm hoping Requiem will still take some big swings with its new twist on the series' survival horror. I have plenty of questions about Resident Evil Requiem, but I'm intrigued about what's to come for this series' next big move ahead.\nResident Evil Requiem will be released on February 27, 2026 for PC, PS5, Xbox Series X|S.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/resident-evil-requiem-feels-very-familiar-but-its-so-well-made-that-i-respect-the-hell-out-of-it-180022141.html?src=rss",

The big one is a new 10.8MP telephoto camera with a 5x optical zoom, which should make the phone much more adept for portraits and shots of faraway objects. We’ll have to see how noticeable these changes are in practice. The battery is also slightly larger at 4,970mAh, up from 4,700mAh. And like every other Pixel 10 phone, the device runs on a new Tensor G5 chip. Google promises improved CPU and TPU (for AI) performance there, though it’s had something of a spotty track record with custom-made silicon in the past, so we’ll have to put the chip through its paces to see how well it holds up against Qualcomm’s better Snapdragon SoCs. Elsewhere, all of the Pixel 10 phones support magnetic Qi2 charging, which here is branded “Pixelsnap.” This is essentially Google’s take on Apple’s MagSafe, and the company is selling accessories like a snap-on charging puck and ring stand alongside the handsets. The most interesting is probably “Magic Cue,” which promises to proactively surface contextually relevant information within apps. Either way, Google will still provide seven years of OS and security updates for each new phone. As for pre-order perks, Amazon and Best Buy are bundling the phone with a $100 gift card."

    "summary": "Ever since Samsung introduced the Galaxy Ring, I’ve wanted Google to make a smart ring. I initially imagined it would be a Pixel Ring — something that would fit into the existing wearable portfolio that includes the Pixel Watch and Pixel Buds. But at a recent roundtable with the heads of Google’s Health, Fitbit and Wearables businesses, I was presented a more compelling possibility. When CNN’s Lisa Eadicicco asked the question on everyone’s mind about whether Google would expand its wearable product portfolio with other types of gadgets, the answer surprised me.\nAfter first giving an expected “nothing to share as yet” response, Sandeep Waraich, the senior director of product management for Google Wearables, pointed towards the Fitbit family. “We see there’s a big opportunity with a discrete device that lasts very long [and] has a simple experience that’s very focused on health and fitness.”\nWaraich continued by saying “today, Fitbit has a pretty robust portfolio but it has not been refreshed for a while, so that’s where we see opportunity and we have been deeply thinking about bringing the right experiences.” He did not reveal much more upon further pushing, but one thing became clear to me. If Google were to make a smart ring, it would be part of the Fitbit family.\nThat makes a lot of sense, if you consider the activity trackers that Fitbit is synonymous with. They are fairly basic wristworn devices that do little more than count your steps, track your heart rate and occasionally vibrate to tell you to look at your phone. You could say they’re unsophisticated, but they’re also simple and serve very specific purposes. Plus, they last forever — clocking between days and weeks on a charge.\nAs someone who loathes wearing any device to bed, I’m frustrated at the lack of options available to me for sleep-tracking. Bed sensors don’t seem to get very accurate data, while bedside radar or motion detectors (like the Nest Hub or Amazon’s retired Halo RIse) have been largely abandoned by their makers. A smart ring, like the Galaxy Ring or Oura, are effective and comfortable solutions.\nThe thing is, a lot of my digital data is housed in Google services. I’m a Gmail girl, and I pay quite a lot every month for a generous amount of Drive storage. A Google-powered sleep tracker appeals to my data hoarder tendencies.\nThrow in the fact that Fitbit has long led the way in accurate and sophisticated sleep and activity tracking, and a Fitbit Ring’s potential grows significantly.\nOf course, there’s always the risk that, should Google make a smart ring, it might give up on the product after a few years, rendering my data or device useless. Just look at the Google graveyard. I will say that Waraich and his colleagues seem to see a future where people have multiple devices that serve various, specific purposes. A smartwatch and smart ring could both coexist as useful accessories that feed into a person’s main device, which these days is usually a smartphone. In addition to those gadgets, people likely also own laptops, TVs and tablets — screens of all sizes.\nIn response to a follow-up question on the topic of a multi-device lifestyle, Google’s general manager of Health and Home Rishi Chandra said “There’s no doubt we need to maximize the devices you already have.” But he added “there’s no doubt in my mind there’s going to be new form factors that will exist.” He cautioned, though, that “it’s too early to have conviction,” stating that currently the team is in the “experimentation phase.”\n“We are experimenting,” Chandra said. What comes out of that experimentation and what sticks around ultimately depends on developments in the industry that no one can assuredly predict. I do think, though, that given the company’s expertise in simple, straightforward activity trackers, a Fitbit Ring would not be too much of a stretch. Plus, the fact that the Oura Ring is now in its fourth generation and that it and the Galaxy Ring have proven to be worthwhile devices show that there is a market for this category.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wearables/a-fitbit-ring-would-make-so-much-sense-163055386.html?src=rss",
    "full_text": "But at a recent roundtable with the heads of Google’s Health, Fitbit and Wearables businesses, I was presented a more compelling possibility. When CNN’s Lisa Eadicicco asked the question on everyone’s mind about whether Google would expand its wearable product portfolio with other types of gadgets, the answer surprised me. Waraich continued by saying “today, Fitbit has a pretty robust portfolio but it has not been refreshed for a while, so that’s where we see opportunity and we have been deeply thinking about bringing the right experiences.” He did not reveal much more upon further pushing, but one thing became clear to me. If Google were to make a smart ring, it would be part of the Fitbit family. Plus, they last forever — clocking between days and weeks on a charge.

    "summary": "Google is kicking off the fall tech event season (albeit in late summer) today with its Made by Google showcase. The headline attraction at the event is the Pixel 10 lineup, but there's plenty of other interesting stuff on offer too, such as the Pixel Watch 4, Pixel Buds 2a and — of course — a bunch of AI-related announcements.\nGoogle has also confirmed something many folks have been waiting for: its take on MagSafe. The company is calling its version Pixelsnap.\nHere's a look at everything that announced at the Made by Google event, along with links to our more in-depth coverage of each product and our hands-on impressions:\nPixel 10\n\nA tenth birthday is typically cause for a special celebration. The Pixel brand isn't quite that old yet (the original Google Pixel arrived in 2016), but there might still be enough to the base Pixel 10 to make fans don a conical hat and blow a party horn.\nFor one thing, this is the first non-Pro Pixel phone to boast a telephoto lens. It is a 5x optical zoom lens, but it supports 10x optical image quality with the help of cropping and computational photography.  Using the Super Res Zoom feature can give you a 20x zoom equivalent. Along with the telephoto lens, the Pixel 10 has 48MP wide and 13MP ultrawide sensors on the rear, as well as a 10.5MP selfie lens.\nAs with the other phones in this year's lineup, the Pixel 10 runs on the Google Tensor G5 chip. It's said to be 34 percent faster than the Tensor G4 chipset and it's the first chipset that runs the Gemini Nano model. According to Google, that supports more than 20 generative AI experiences that run locally.\nThe user interface is in line for some changes too. The company says Material 3 will support expressive photo wallpapers, customizable quick settings and improved typography. All of that should look pretty good on the Actua display, which delivers up to 3,000 nits of brightness.\nGoogle also claims that the Pixel 10's battery can power the device for more than 30 hours, up from the 24-plus hours for which the Pixel 9 lineup was rated. When you use a 30W adapter, you'll be able to charge the Pixel 10 to 55 percent of its capacity (i.e. 16-plus hours of use) in 30 minutes. In addition, the handset boasts a satin metal finish, Gorilla Glass Victus 2 and an IP68 rating for dust and water resistance.\nThe Pixel 10 will shelves on August 28. It starts at $799 and will be available in Obsidian, Frost, Lemongrass and Indigo colorways.\nRead more about the Pixel 10.\nPixel 10 Pro / Pro 10 XL\nSam Rutherford for Engadget\nHow would you like that thing we just told you about but with higher specs and maybe a larger display? The Pixel 10 Pro and Pixel 10 Pro XL each boast a 50MP wide lens, a 48MP ultrawide and a 48MP 5x telephoto lens. Google claims this is its best camera system in a smartphone to date. There's more memory in these models too, with 16GB of RAM versus 12GB in the base Pixel 10. (The Pixel 10 Pro Fold has 16GB of RAM too.)\nThe Super Actua displays are about 10 percent brighter than on the Pixel 9 Pro series, with 2,200 nits of full-screen brightness or 3,300 peak when viewing HDR content, and that's while consuming less power than previous models. The Pixel 10 Pro has a 6.3-inch screen while the Pixel 10 Pro XL has a 6.8-inch display, and each has a variable refresh rate of up to 120Hz.\nAs with the base Pixel 10, the Pro models are slated to have more than 30 hours of battery life on a single charge. The Pixel 10 Pro supports 30W fast charging, while you can top up a Pixel 10 Pro XL with 45W of fast charging. Both support Qi2, but in what's said to be a first for a phone, the 10 Pro XL offers 25W wireless charging via Qi2.2 compatibility. The Pixel 10 Pro XL has upgraded speakers too, with what Google claims is loud and powerful bass, along with full and balanced stereo audio.\nThe Pixel 10 Pro and 10 Pro XL will be available in Moonstone, Jade, Porcelain and Obsidian colorways on August 28, with pre-orders opening up today. The Pixel 10 Pro starts at $999 for 128GB of storage and the Pixel 10 Pro XL will run you $1,199 for 256GB of storage.\nRead more about the Pixel 10 Pro and Pixel 10 Pro XL. \nPixel 10 Pro Fold\nSam Rutherford for Engadget\nOf course, there's a fourth phone in the Pixel 10 lineup this fall. Google made durability a priority on the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, which has an IP68 rating for dust and water resistance (a first for a foldable, the company says). A new gearless hinge will help with that — Google says it's twice as durable as the hinge in the Pixel 9 Pro Fold. In fact, the company claims the Pixel 10 Pro Fold is designed to handle over 10 years of folding.\nThe internal, eight-inch Super Actua Reflex display (said to be the largest on any phone), and outer 6.4-inch Actua display both deliver up to 3,000 nits of brightness. Google says it redesigned the interior with resilient, ultra-thin glass, along with dual anti-impact layers to help protect it from drops.\nThe Pixel 10 Pro Fold is said to have the largest battery in a foldable yet, with a 5,015mAh capacity. As with the rest of the Pixel 10 lineup, there's Qi2 wireless charging support — an apparent first for a foldable. Alternatively, you'll be able to charge the battery to half of its capacity in 30 minutes with a 30W adapter, Google says.\nThe triple-camera array includes a new 48MP main sensor, along with a 10.5MP ultrawide lens with macro focus and a 10.8MP telephoto lens. A feature called Instant View will show recently-taken pictures alongside the viewfinder. Google says it improved multitasking as well, with split-screen functionality that supports app resizing and the option to drag and drop files.\nThe Pixel 10 Pro Fold comes in Moonstone and Jade colorways, but it'll arrive later than the rest of the Pixel 10 family — it's scheduled to land on October 9. It starts at $1,799 for 256GB of storage. If you're willing to splash out more cash, though, you can have up to 1TB of onboard storage, the first time that's been an option in a Pixel Pro Fold.\nRead more about the Pixel 10 Pro Fold.\nPixelsnap\nSam Rutherford for Engadget\nAs mentioned above, all of the Pixel 10 devices have Qi2 wireless charging capabilities built-in, but Google is expanding on that with its own, long-awaited spin on MagSafe. Google's take is called Pixelsnap. The company is offering a slew of magnetic accessories for Pixel 10 devices, including cases, a charging puck, charging stand and non-charging ring stand.\nRead more about Pixelsnap.\nAI updates\nSam Rutherford for Engadget\nThis being Google in the Gregorian calendar year of 2025, of course there are a bunch of AI features coming to the Pixel 10 lineup (some should trickle down to older models later). Magic Cue might be the handiest of the latest tools. This is said to deliver proactive suggestions based on your activity by pulling data from the likes of Gmail and Google Calendar.\nFor instance, if you're calling your airline, Magic Cue might pull up your flight details. If a friend asks for the address of your Airbnb vacation rental, Magic Cue could bring that up to save you some time.\nThere are plenty of other AI tools on the way to Pixel 10 devices. I am an abysmal photographer, so Camera Coach sounds like it could be a genuinely useful feature for people like me. When you point the cameras at a subject or scene you want to capture, Gemini kicks into gear to analyze what the lenses are picking up. The feature will offer composition and framing suggestions, and suggest camera modes to employ. Gemini Live can offer visual guidance with on-screen overlays. \nMeanwhile, the Guided Frame feature will describe what the camera sees, primarily to assist blind and low-vision users. This is said to work on any scene and seems (at least on the surface) similar to services like Be My Eyes.\nSam Rutherford for Engadget\nOther Pixel 10 AI camera tools include Auto Best Take, which can seemingly pick out the best group photo from multiple options. As for adjusting images, the Conversational Editing feature harnesses Gemini to help you tweak things using natural language voice prompts. You might ask it to adjust lighting, change the framing of a shot or remove objects, and hopefully Gemini will be able to handle those without a hitch. \nIn addition, Pixel 10 devices are the first phones to implement C2PA (Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity) content credentials directly in the camera app. This is an industry standard labeling system for content that's created or modified using generative AI.\nElsewhere, Pixel translation tools could be in line for a serious upgrade with Voice Translate. Google says this feature will be able to translate calls in real-time in your own voice.\nGoogle has folded a new native audio model into Gemini Live that's said to control the emotional tone and be capable of detecting a user's emotions. AI could help you better manage your calls too. The Call Message function will keep missed and declined calls separate from spam, and offer real-time transcripts as well as suggestions for next steps. Gboard writing tools, Pixel Studio and NotebookLM integration are in line for updates too.\nSam Rutherford for Engadget\nLast but not least, Pixel 10 devices have a Pixel Journal app that will remain private (following in Apple's footsteps to a degree). The app harnesses AI to offer prompts that may help you track your progress and record your thoughts. \nRead more about the Pixel 10 AI features.\nPixel Watch 4\nSam Rutherford for Engadget\nLet's move on from phones and take a gander at Google's latest smartwatch. The Pixel Watch 4 has a new dome-style display that's 10 percent larger than the screen on the Pixel Watch 3. It can reach up to 3,000 nits of brightness. Battery life is said to be improved too, with Google claiming it can power the wearable for up to 40 hours on a single charge. Google has also made it easier to replace the screen and battery this time around too, though we'll have to see it in person before we can judge how easy it is to actually do.\nOther features include satellite connectivity for emergencies (when you're out of range of Wi-Fi and cell towers), an electrocardiogram app and irregular heart rhythm notifications. Google says the Pixel Watch 4 will be able to detect when a wearer's heart stops beating and contact emergency services. There will also be an AI-based personal fitness coach. Fitbit Premium subscribers will be the first to gain access to that.\nThe Pixel Watch 4 will be available in in two sizes, 41mm and 45mm. It starts at $349 and will hit shelves on October 9.\nRead more about the Pixel Watch 4 and AI personal fitness coach.\nPixel Buds 2a and Pixel Buds Pro 2 updates\nSam Rutherford for Engadget\nGoogle hasn't forgotten about its earbuds here either. The company is releasing the the Pixel Buds 2a with active noise cancellation (ANC), powered by a Tensor A1 chip. Even with this upgrade, these are Google's lightest and smallest A-Series earbuds to date.\nThey're IP54 rated for dust and water resistance, while the charging case has an IPX4 rating. The Tensor A1 chip is also said to deliver improved quality for calls and other audio, while supporting Gemini and other AI features in the Pixel Buds 2a. These earbuds are said to have double the battery life of their predecessors at 10 hours on a single charge, with the case adding 17 hours of listening time (seven and 13 hours, respectively, when ANC is enabled). \nThe Pixel Buds 2a will be available on October 9 in Hazel and Iris colorways. However, due to these upgrades, the Pixel Buds 2a will cost $130, which is $31 more than the previous generation.\nMeanwhile, Google is offering the Pixel Buds Pro 2 in a new colorway, Moonstone, to match some of the Pixel 10 devices. A software update in September will introduce more features to the Pixel Buds Pro 2, including protection from certain sudden loud noises, the ability to adjust audio based on the volume of your surroundings, a way to answer or dismiss calls with head gestures and advanced audio processing for Gemini Live.\nRead more about the Pixel Buds 2a and Pixel Buds Pro 2 updates.\nHands-on with the Pixel 10 lineup and Pixel Watch 4\nSam Rutherford for Engadget\nAhead of the Made by Google event, we had a chance to go hands-on with the new devices. You can now check out our first impressions of:\n\nGoogle Pixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro and Pixel 10 Pro XL\nPixel 10 Pro Fold\nPixel Watch 4\n\nIf you're interested in pre-ordering any of those — or the Pixel Buds 2a — we've got you covered with our pre-order guide.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/everything-announced-at-the-made-by-google-pixel-event-including-the-pixel-10-lineup-161155567.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Software has always been an integral part of the Pixel experience, and that's not changing with the new Pixel 10 family. At its Made by Google event today in New York, Google detailed a suite of new machine learning and AI features that will debut with the Pixel 10 series before making their way to earlier models.   \nThe first new tool most people are likely to encounter is Magic Cue. As you're texting your friends, Gemini Nano, Google's private on-device model, will populate the conversation with contextual suggestions. For example, if a friend asks about a dinner reservation you two made last week, the Pixel 10 will display a shortcut you can tap to send them a Google Maps listing. Magic Cue depends on there being a digital paper trail to work. You can long press the shortcuts it generates to see where Gemini sourced the information it's relaying to you. In the case of the example above, it may have come from your personal Gmail. \nSam Rutherford for Engadget\nThe feature has extensions throughout Android. For instance, if a family member texts you about a flight you two are about to take, Magic Cue will not only provide the number of the airline, it will also display information about your flight on screen for easy reference.     \nOn the Discover page, which you can access on nearly every Android device by swiping to the leftmost page of your phone's home screen, there's a new shortcut to a feature called the Daily Hub. Like Samsung's Now Brief, it's a page with an AI-generated summary of the upcoming day. At the top, you'll see a greeting, with a weather forecast and and any upcoming events on your calendar. Below that, there will be a list of reminders pulled from Gmail, Keep and other Google apps. If you keep scrolling, you'll also find recommended articles and videos from YouTube.  \nSam Rutherford for Engadget\nFor those who also want to reflect at the end of their day, there's a new Journal app too. It has AI features built throughout. For instance, as you're writing an entry, it will automatically suggest images to include from your photo library. Additionally, the app will attempt to automatically categorize your entries based on topics you've designated. Google has used emoji for this part of the interface, which make it easy to see at a glance what you wrote about from the app's monthly view.       \nOver in Photos, Google has introduced a feature called Conversational Editing. It allows you to tweak an image by describing to your phone how you want it modified. For example, say you took a selfie of yourself in a busy tourist location. You can tell Photos — using your voice, your phone's on-screen keyboard or a suggested prompt — to edit all the strangers out of the scene. After a few moments, the on-device model will produce a new image, with the original displayed alongside it so you can compare the two. It's possible to build multiple edits on top of one another, and if you don't like the latest edit, you can go back. \nSam Rutherford for Engadget\nIn the camera app, there are a handful of new AI features. First, there's Camera Coach, which will examine the shot you're about to snap. It will read the scene and make suggestions on the angle and lighting to use, as well what capture mode is best for the situation. Another new AI feature, dubbed Auto Best Take, finds and combines similar photos so that everyone in a group shot looks their best. Lastly, Google updated last year's Add Me feature to make it easier to include the photographer in even larger groups.  \nElsewhere, Google is introducing a few upgrades to its Gemini Live visual assistant that build on the base the company debuted last year. To start, there are new visual indicators that will mask part of your phone's screen to make it easier to see what Gemini is referring to when it answers a question. This feature will be available first on Pixel 10 devices before rolling out to other Android phones and iOS devices later. Separately, Google says it will soon release a new model that \"dramatically\" improves how Gemini uses key elements of human speech. For instance, you'll be able to tell the assistant to speak slowly if you're jotting down notes, and it will change its tone depending on the emotional nature of the topic you're discussing.   \nThe Pixel 10 family is available to per-order today, with general availability of the Pixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro and Pixel 10 Pro XL to follow on August 28. The Pixel 10 Pro Fold, Pixel Watch 4 and Pixel Buds 2a won't arrive at retail until October 9. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/all-the-new-ai-features-coming-to-the-pixel-10-phones-160017270.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "After the usual months of rumors and anticipation, Google has officially launched the new Pixel 10 Pro and 10 Pro XL at its Made by Google event. The new generation flagship devices carry packed spec sheets with impressive upgrades from the Pixel 9 Pro. Perhaps the most exciting among them is the addition of Pixelsnap, which supports Google's new ecosystem of Qi2-compatible chargers that magnetically align to the back of the phone. Beyond just the convenience, Qi2 compatibility should offer faster wireless charging speeds, too. This functionality had been conspicuously missing from flagship Android devices until now, and spawns a whole new world of accessories that can snap onto the back of the Pixel.\nGoogle's flagship phones have long been known for delivering excellent photos, and these new Pixel's continue that tradition. Both models carry a triple rear camera system with a 50MP wide lens, a 48MP ultrawide with macro, and an “upgraded” 48MP 5x telephoto lens. It’s not clear yet what’s new about that telephoto camera, as it has the same f/2.8 aperture and 22-degree field of view as the one on the Pixel 9 Pro series. ProRes support is standard for more serious photo editors. \nThe 6.3-inch Pixel 10 Pro and the 6.8-inch Pixel 10 Pro XL will both feature a Super Actua display with variable refresh rate up to 120 Hz. The displays offer up to 3,300 nits of peak brightness or 2,200 nits peak in HDR, about ten percent brighter than on the Pixel 9 Pro series.\nBoth models boast their largest batteries yet with over 30 hours of battery life, which represents a roughly 25 percent boost over the last generation. The Pixel 10 Pro supports 30W fast charging while the Pro XL supports 45W. While both phones support the Qi2 standard, the 10 Pro XL is the first phone to support Qi2.2 with 25W wireless charging. The standard 10 Pro is limited to 15W wireless charging. Both sizes will be sold with 16GB of RAM. \nThe Pro and Pro XL will both sport the Google Tensor G5 chip, which powers new on-board AI features coming to the entire Pixel 10 lineup. Key among them is Magic Cue, which can provide relevant information to the user by understanding when it's needed, like pulling up your flight info when you're calling the airline. Camera Coach is another AI-powered feature that will help users take better photographs by helping them find the best angle or lighting.\nBoth sizes will be available in four color choices, those being Moonstone, Jade, Porcelain and Obsidian. The Pixel 10 Pro will launch at $999 for the 128GB model, and the Pixel 10 Pro XL will launch at $1,199 with 256GB of storage (double what the Pixel 9 Pro XL included). The new Pixel Pro line is available for pre-orders today and will hit shelves on August 28.\n \n \nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/the-pixel-10-pro-series-features-brighter-displays-bigger-batteries-and-qi2-wireless-charging-160059520.html?src=rss",
