Ambiq closed its first day as a public company with a valuation of $656 million (excluding employee options). This represents a significant increase from its last private funding valuation of $450 million in 2023, according to PitchBook. Ambiq has pitched itself as well-positioned to capitalize on the growth driven by AI. “Because we’re so low energy, we can put more intelligence and more AI on board” of edge processors, the company’s CTO Scott Hanson told TechCrunch. For the three months that ended March 31, Ambiq posted a net loss of $8.3 million against revenues of $15.7 million, the company’s S1 filing shows. The Q1 results mark a slight improvement from the first quarter of 2024, when the company reported a $9.8 million loss on $15.2 million in revenue. Kleiner Perkins and EDB Investments, a Singaporean state-backed entity, are the largest outside backers of Ambiq, according to the filing. Wen Hsieh, who was a general partner at Kleiner Perkins until 2023, first backed Ambiq when the company raised its Series C in 2014. Hsieh also invested in Ambiq after he launched his own venture firm, Matter Venture Partners, two years ago."

Meta also warned Wall Street that it would spend more on data centers and hiring next year. ”Our business continues to perform very well, which enables us to invest heavily in our AI efforts,” Zuckerberg said during today’s earnings call. Meta’s cash cannon is now fully pointed at his new moonshot of achieving superintelligence, or as he puts it, AI that “surpasses human intelligence in every way.” He bragged about providing the richly compensated members of his new superintelligence lab “access to unparalleled compute” for training new models that will “push the next frontier in a year or so.” Zuckerberg’s last moonshot was the metaverse, which came up only once at the very end of today’s earnings call. It’s too early to compare the two projects, but they share a key similarity: they need the kind of funding that only a company like Meta can provide. A new AI model for delivering ads has driven approximately five percent more conversions on Facebook and three percent more conversions on Instagram, according to CFO Susan Li. While Meta is still spending heavily on the metaverse (it’s on track to spend a total of $100 billion on its Reality Labs division this year), there’s no mistaking the fact that AI is officially Zuckerberg’s top priority."

    "summary": "\niPhone devotees, listen up: Tons of new updates are coming to Apple's operating system this fall that you'll be excited to try out. But instead of being named iOS 19, it'll be called iOS 26. The biggest change? The new Liquid Glass design (think Windows Vista, but arguably more thoughtful), which looks to be Apple's largest visual update in years. We spent two weeks test-driving it — you can check out our detailed hands-on iOS 26 preview, or you can try it out yourself by downloading and installing the public beta, available now. Before you dive in, we'll help you answer this question: Will my iPhone be able to run iOS 26?\nLast year, Apple didn't nix any iPhones from its eligibility list, but that's not the case for 2025 — a few models are getting cut this time. All iPhone 8 models and the iPhone X were the last to get the boot in 2023, and this year the 2018 models are getting left behind. If you have an ineligible device, you won't be able to download iOS 26 when it becomes available this fall.\nWe'll get to the bottom of which iPhones will support iOS 26 this year. To see what's coming with the latest OS and more, check out everything announced at Apple's WWDC June 9 event. \nThese three iPhones won't be compatible with iOS 26\nUnlike last year, several iPhone models won't be eligible to download the newest iOS when it makes its debut this fall. This trio of models first released in 2018 won't be coming to the iOS 26 party:\n\niPhone XR\niPhone XS\niPhone XS Max\n\niPhones compatible with iOS 26\nWhile we don't yet know the new iPhones Apple will be dropping this fall — though there are iPhone 17 rumors — we do know, per Apple's site, that the phones listed below will be compatible with iOS 26. Basically, if you have an iPhone that was announced in 2019 or later, you're in the clear:\n\niPhone SE (second generation or later)\niPhone 11\niPhone 11 Pro\niPhone 11 Pro Max\niPhone 12\niPhone 12 mini\niPhone 12 Pro\niPhone 12 Pro Max\niPhone 13\niPhone 13 mini\niPhone 13 Pro\niPhone 13 Pro Max\niPhone 14\niPhone 14 Plus\niPhone 14 Pro\niPhone 14 Pro Max\niPhone 15\niPhone 15 Plus\niPhone 15 Pro\niPhone 15 Pro Max\niPhone 16e\niPhone 16\niPhone 16 Plus\niPhone 16 Pro\niPhone 16 Pro Max\n\nWhat if I don't want to buy a new iPhone?\nIf you want to continue using your older iPhone that isn't supported by iOS 26, that's fine. However, you'll miss out on security updates which could potentially put your phone at risk for malware and other threats. Additionally, some apps may stop working if they require a certain version of iOS or later. And of course, you won't be able to access the latest features iOS 26 offers.\nWhen will iOS 26 become available?\nApple usually rolls out its latest iOS in mid-September, just a few days before the new iPhones hit store shelves. Last year, it released iOS 18 on Monday, Sept. 16. Expect a confirmation of the release date at the iPhone 17 event, expected in early September. \niOS 26 features we're excited about\nLiquid Glass design: Your home screen is getting revamped with new app icons, including dark mode and all-clear options. You'll also notice buttons with a new floating design. Liquid Glass was designed to make all of Apple's OSes more cohesive.\nPhone app redesign: You'll finally be able to scroll through contacts, recent calls and voicemail messages all on one screen. It also comes with a new feature called Hold Assist that'll notify you when an agent comes to the phone so you can avoid the elevator music.\nLive Translate: iOS 26 is bringing the ability to have a conversation via phone call or text message with someone who speaks another language. Live Translate will translate your conversation in real time. \nPolls feature: Coming to group messages in the Messages app, chat members will be able to create polls. This can help prevent the unwanted 30+ messages when it comes to deciding which restaurant you're meeting at this weekend.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/apple-ios-26-is-your-iphone-compatible-heres-a-list-which-devices-can-download-it-today-191854768.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Liquid Glass is a huge new change coming to iOS 26. (Apple)\nCan't wait until the fall to access all the new Apple iOS 26 features? You can officially download and install the public beta if you're looking forward to seeing what's coming this year. Prefer more of a guided tour? Check out our preview of the iOS 26 public beta release, which shows off the fresh home and lock screen redesign we've been asking to see for years. Called Liquid Glass, the new translucent look will extend across all of Apple's upcoming operating systems. The overhaul is one of several big changes coming to iOS, macOS, iPadOS and the rest of Apple's software suite, all of which were showcased during the company's WWDC keynote on June 9. \nAfter overpromising on AI plans last year, Apple kept its iOS roadmap focused more on basic quality of life improvements this year. There are multiple useful additions coming to the Phone and Messages apps on your iPhone, for instance: Apple execs outlined the ability to weed out spam texts or other unknown senders and an option to hold your spot on a phone call when you've been waiting for a representative to pick up. Plus, a treasured feature that we took for granted is coming back (hint: it's in the Photos app).\nSiri, meanwhile, is in a holding pattern. Apple has previously specified that its smarter voice assistant — first promised at WWDC 2024 — is delayed until some point \"in the coming year,\" so you shouldn't expect any major changes in the current betas. But there are reports that Apple is aiming to give Siri a bigger brain transplant by basing it on third-party artificial intelligence models like OpenAI's ChatGPT or Anthropic's Claude, which could make 2026 a pivotal year.\nWith each beta, it seems like additional new improvements are popping up, like a newly discovered FaceTime feature that'll freeze your video if it detects nudity. Most newer iPhone models are eligible to download iOS 26 (both the betas and final version). Want to see the full list of new features coming this fall? Read on.  \nWhat is iOS 26?\nWhile the current iPhone operating system is iOS 18, Apple is skipping the numbering ahead to iOS 26 later this year. The company has decided to line up its iOS version numbers with a year-based system, similar to car model years. So while iOS and its sibling operating systems will be released in late 2025, they're all designated \"26\" to reflect the year ahead. (Meanwhile, iOS 18 is still getting new versions this summer, too.)\nIt's official, we're moving to iOS 26. (Apple)\nWhat is Liquid Glass design?\nLet's be honest. Out of everything announced at WWDC this year, the new Liquid Glass design was the star of the show. The iPhone's home and lock screens have looked pretty much the same year after year — the last exciting thing (in my opinion) was the option to add your own aesthetic to your home screen by customizing your apps and widgets. So seeing the home and lock screens' new facelift is refreshing.\nSo what exactly is Liquid Glass? Apple calls it a \"new translucent material\" since, well, the apps and widgets are clear. However, the screen can still adapt to dark and light modes, depending on surroundings. You'll also notice buttons with a new floating design in several apps, like Phone and Maps. They're designed to be less distracting than the current buttons, but are still easy to see. While the design overhaul has proven to be controversial since its announcement, some — including Engadget's own Devindra Hardawar — like the new direction, even if it's somewhat reminiscent of Microsoft's translucent Windows Vista Aero designs from nearly twenty years ago.\nThat said, as of the release of the iOS 26 beta 2, Apple has already incorporated some user feedback into the design, dialing back the transparency in at least some places. And while it will continue to evolve, Apple users won't be able to escape it: Liquid Glass was designed to make all of Apple's OSes more cohesive. Here's a look at how the translucent aesthetic will look with the new macOS Tahoe 26 on your desktop.\nWhat are the new and notable features of iOS 26?\niOS 26 has a laundry list of new features. Among the most worthwhile:\nPhone app redesign: You'll finally be able to scroll through contacts, recent calls and voicemail messages all on one screen. It also comes with a new feature called Hold Assist that'll notify you when an agent comes to the phone so you can avoid the elevator music and continue on with other tasks.\nLive Translation in Phone, FaceTime and Messages: iOS 26 is bringing the ability to have a conversation via phone call or text message with someone who speaks another language. Live Translation will translate your conversation in real time, which results in some stop-and-go interactions in the examples Apple shared during its presentation.\nPolls in group chats: Tired of sorting through what seems like hundreds of messages in your group chat? You and your friends will soon be able to create polls in group messages for deciding things like which brunch spot you're eating at or whose car you're taking on a road trip.\nFiltering unknown senders in Messages: If you haven't received spam texts about unpaid tolls or other citations, you're lucky. For those of us who have, those annoying messages will soon be filtered away in a separate folder.\nVisual Intelligence: Similar to a reverse Google image search, this new feature will allow you to search for anything that's on your iPhone screen. For instance, if you spot a pair of shoes someone is wearing in an Instagram photo, you can screenshot it and use Visual Intelligence to find those shoes (or similar ones) online.\nPhotos tabs are back: For anyone who's still frustrated with the Photos changes made last year, you'll be happy to know that your tabs are coming back. Library and Collections will have their own separate spaces so you don't have to scroll to infinity to find what you're looking for.\nFaceTime \"Communication Safety\" feature: A newer addition to iOS 26 appears to be the FaceTime \"Communication Safety\" feature that pauses communications if and when nudity is detected. The feature appears to be a child safety feature that uses on-device detection, thus obviating any cloud-based privacy issues. \nApple's Hold Assist will be nifty for those pesky services that put you on hold for 10 or more minutes. (Apple)\nWhich iPhones will be able to upgrade to iOS 26?\nA few iPhone models that run the current version of iOS — iPhone XR, XS and XS Max — won't be compatible with the latest upgrade. But any iPhones released in 2019 or later will be eligible for the iOS 26 update.\n\niPhone SE (second generation or later)\niPhone 11\niPhone 11 Pro\niPhone 11 Pro Max\niPhone 12\niPhone 12 mini\niPhone 12 Pro\niPhone 12 Pro Max\niPhone 13\niPhone 13 mini\niPhone 13 Pro\niPhone 13 Pro Max\niPhone 14\niPhone 14 Plus\niPhone 14 Pro\niPhone 14 Pro Max\niPhone 15\niPhone 15 Plus\niPhone 15 Pro\niPhone 15 Pro Max\niPhone 16e\niPhone 16\niPhone 16 Plus\niPhone 16 Pro\niPhone 16 Pro Max\n\nNot listed here are the presumed new iPhone 17 models (or maybe iPhone 26?) that are all but certain to be announced and released in September. \nHow to install iOS 26 beta\nThe iOS 26 public beta is now available to download via the Apple Beta Software Program. If you're not already a member, you'll need to sign up to try out all the latest features. Just visit beta.apple.com and sign up with your phone number or email address. It's free.\nOnce you're in, you can install it by going to Settings > General > Software Update and selecting iOS 26 public beta.\nA word of caution: Don't sign up with your main iPhone unless you're OK with any risks that occur with using an OS that isn't finalized.\nWhen will the final version of iOS 26 be released?\niOS 26 will be released to the public this fall. It usually comes in September, within a week of the Apple iPhone event. Last year, it rolled out to iPhone users on September 16 — exactly one week after the iPhone 16 lineup was announced.\nIf you're more interested in the Apple Intelligence features coming, here's everything Apple revealed for iOS, macOS and more during WWDC. Also, check out how iOS 26 screenshots could be an intriguing preview of Apple's delayed Siri rework.\nUpdate, July 24: Noted the iOS 26 public beta is now available.\nUpdate, July 3: Noted new FaceTime feature found in the developer beta.\nUpdate, June 30: Noted ongoing iOS 18 releases, and reports that Apple is considering additional external LLMs for Siri. \nUpdate, June 25: Noted changes added in iOS 26 beta 2. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/ios-26-beta-release-heres-everything-you-need-to-know-about-new-apple-features-and-how-to-get-it-on-your-iphone-135749519.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Earlier today, Mark Zuckerberg shared a rambling memo outlining his vision to build AI \"superintelligence.\" In the memo, Zuckerberg hinted that the pursuit of more powerful AI might require the company to be more selective in what it open sources.\nCiting \"safety concerns\" he wrote that Meta would need to be \"rigorous\" about such decisions. The line stood out to many as Zuckerberg — who once said \"fuck that\" in reference to closed platforms — has made open source central to Meta's AI strategy.\nDuring Meta's second quarter earnings call, Zuckerberg further acknowledged there could be a shift, though he downplayed the significance of it. Here's what he said when asked if his thinking had changed.\nI don't think that our thinking has particularly changed on this. We've always open sourced some of our models and not open sourced everything that we've done. So I would expect that we will continue to produce and share leading open source models. I also think that there are a couple of trends that are playing out. One is that we're getting models that are so big that they're just not practical for a lot of other people to use, so we kind of wrestle with whether it's productive or helpful to share that, or if that's really just primarily helping competitors or something like that. So I think that there's, there's that concern. And then obviously, as you approach real superintelligence, I think there's a whole different set of safety concerns that I think we need to take very seriously, that I wrote about in my note this morning. But I think the bottom line is I would expect that we will continue open sourcing work. I expect us to continue to be a leader there, and I also expect us to continue to not open source everything that we do, which is a continuation of kind of what we, what we've been, been kind of working on.\nThat's notably different than what he wrote almost exactly a year ago in a different memo titled \"Open Source AI is the Path Forward.\" In that, even longer note, he said that open source is crucial for both Meta and developers.\n\"People often ask if I’m worried about giving up a technical advantage by open sourcing Llama, but I think this misses the big picture,\" he wrote. \"I expect AI development will continue to be very competitive, which means that open sourcing any given model isn’t giving away a massive advantage over the next best models at that point in time.\"\nHe also argued that open source is safer. \"There is an ongoing debate about the safety of open source AI models, and my view is that open source AI will be safer than the alternatives. As long as everyone has access to similar generations of models – which open source promotes – then governments and institutions with more compute resources will be able to check bad actors with less compute.\"\nTo be clear, Zuckerberg said the company would continue to open source some of its work. But he seems to be laying the groundwork for a future in which Meta's \"superintelligence\" could be a lot less open.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/is-mark-zuckerberg-flip-flopping-on-open-source-ai-231310567.html?src=rss",

The IPO is 40x oversubscribed, VCs confirmed to TechCrunch and Bloomberg previously reported. That means demand for shares is 40x the number of shares the company and its existing investors are selling. So it should surprise no one that Figma, which offers design software, has priced its initial shares at $33 per share, above its previously announced range. On Monday, the company said its expected price range was $30 to $32, up from a previously announced range of $25 to $28. At the final $33 price, the offering raised $1.2 billion. Most of that money is going to existing shareholders who are selling about twice as many shares (including founder and CEO Dylan Field) as the company itself has offered. The IPO price values Figma at $19.3 billion, CNBC reports, near the $20 billion price Adobe would have paid before its deal to buy Figma fell apart in 2023 under pressure from regulators."

    "full_text": "Echoing sentiments shared in his “superintelligence”-focused blog post this morning, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg expanded on his bullish ideas that glasses will be the primary way users interact with AI in the years ahead. “I think in the future, if you don’t have glasses that have AI — or some way to interact with AI — I think you’re … probably [going to] be at a pretty significant cognitive disadvantage compared to other people,” Zuckerberg added. These wearables have turned into a surprise hit for the company, as revenue from sales of the Ray-Ban Metas more than tripled year-over-year, according to glasses giant EssilorLuxottica. But Zuckerberg believes there’s more to be done with displays. “This is … what we’ve been maxing out with Reality Labs over the last 5 to 10 years — basically doing the research on all these different things,” he said. For example, Meta said Reality Labs’ operating loss was $4.53 billion in the second quarter. Since 2020, the unit has lost nearly $70 billion. This spring, OpenAI acquired former Apple executive Jony Ive’s startup in a $6.5 billion deal to build new consumer devices for interacting with AI. The next AI device could be something we can’t even imagine yet. Still, Zuckerberg cheers the idea that glasses are going to be it."

President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Wednesday that will suspend the de minimis exemption — which allows packages with goods valued less than $800 to enter the US duty-free — for all countries. Earlier this year, Trump ended the de minimis exemption for goods from China and Hong Kong. The White House says the change goes into effect on August 29th. Per the executive order, for the next six months, goods shipped through the international postal system will either be charged the flat tariff rate based on country of origin (an ad valorem duty) or a specific duty ranging from $80 to $200 per item. After six months, all duties will be calculated as ad valorem duties. The White House’s argument for ending the exemption is that packages using it are “subject to less scrutiny than traditional imports” and could “pose health, safety, national and economic security risks.” The White House claims that 98 percent of narcotics seizures (by “number of cases”) are from de minimis shipments. It also says that low-value packages from China and Hong Kong accounted for “the majority of de minimis shipments to the United States.”"

    "full_text": "Meta is pouring money into the physical and technical infrastructure needed to scale its AI ambitions. The company said it expects a similarly large increase in spend on AI infrastructure next year as the company continues to “aggressively [pursue] opportunities to bring additional capacity online to meet the needs of [its] artificial intelligence efforts and business operations.” “We don’t have any finalized transactions to announce, but we generally believe that there will be models here that will attract significant external financing to support large-scale data center projects that are developed using our ability to build world-class infrastructure, while providing us with flexibility should our infrastructure requirements change over time,” Li said. Meta has announced two major AI “titan clusters.” The first is Prometheus in Ohio, which is poised to be among the first AI superclusters to hit 1 gigawatt of compute power when it comes online in 2026. Then there’s Hyperion, a cluster in Louisiana that Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has bragged would have a footprint the size of Manhattan and could scale up to 5 gigawatts over several years. On top of those, Meta has several other unnamed titan-scale clusters underway. One of the company’s projects in Newton County, Georgia, has already caused the water taps to run dry in some residents’ homes. Meta also noted in its earnings report that it expects its second-largest driver of growth to be employee compensation as the company spends millions, and possibly even billions, to poach talented AI engineers and researchers to work for Meta’s newly formed business unit, Superintelligence Labs. Meta’s stock surged 10% in after-hours as investors responded to Meta’s overall performance in the quarter and better-than-expected outlook for the third quarter. Advertising drove Meta’s revenue gains, fueled by AI tools — like AI-powered translations and video generation — to help advertisers create more meaningful and targeted campaigns."

That figure is up 6% year-over-year and helped drive the total family of apps revenue to $47.1 billion, up 22% year-over-year. The company additionally shared that video time spent increased 20% year-over-year in the quarter, also due to optimizations of Meta’s ranking systems and its work to promote more original content on Instagram.

The company also stated that it would finalize an “appropriate business model” for real-money game developers. Similarly, Google has proposed to allow “games of skill” to be advertised in India where the app maker provides proof by a third party that it is a game of skill and not gambling. Google said it would begin allowing compliant real-money games on its Play Store in India within 120 days of the CCI’s approval, while related ad policy changes would take effect within 150 days of the regulator’s order. Real-money gaming dominates India’s online gaming market, accounting for nearly 86% of total industry revenue — ₹274.38 billion ($3 billion) in 2024 — per a joint report by WinZO and the Interactive Entertainment and Innovation Council (IEIC) released earlier this year."

    "summary": "Fable, a startup designing tools to generate animated TV shows from scratch, is launching an AI-powered streaming service this week, Variety reports. The service is called Showrunner, and it will allow subscribers to generate scenes, view content created for Fable's in-house AI-generated animated shows and even insert themselves into the animations they generate.\nShowrunner is launching in alpha, and based on Fable's website, you'll primarily interact with it through the company's Discord to start. Per Variety, subscribers will pay anywhere from $10 to $20 month for credits that can be exchanged for the ability to generate new animated scenes. The word \"scenes\" is key here. While Fable is launching with a couple of distinct animated shows, they're really more like collections of worlds and characters that subscribers can use to create new scenes. \nThose include Exit Valley, a Family Guy-inspired riff on the culture of Silicon Valley, and Everything is Fine, a comedy about a husband and wife who are stranded in an alternate world and trying to reunite. The company's goal is bigger than than just original content. Fable founder Edward Saatchi imagines a Disney-owned \"Toy Story of AI\" where subscribers could generate endless new scenes of Buzz and Woody interacting. For now, though, interested Showrunner users have to settle with knockoffs.\nEngadget was able to preview an earlier version of Fable's Showrunner AI models back in 2019 that capably generated new South Park episodes based on audio inputs. The startup's model was able to create a watchable copy of the show's style even back then, which might be why Amazon has invested an undisclosed amount in Fable as part of the launch of Showrunner. \nWhile creatives remain skeptical to downright antagonist towards AI, companies have started using it more publicly in production. For example, Netflix recently touted its use of generative AI in its original show The Eternaut. Even if adoption grows, though, that doesn't really clarify whether the average film or TV viewer has any desire to generate content on their own, especially if it's as rough-around-the-edges as most AI-generated media is. Besides being a public demonstration of Fable's tech, Showrunner seems like a test to see if that desire is even there.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/showrunner-an-ai-powered-streaming-service-launches-in-alpha-this-week-204042241.html?src=rss",

The efforts will focus on two areas: creating a framework for patients and providers to easily share information, and creating more personal tools so patients can access resources needed to stay informed about their health. Such tools include apps to manage diabetes and obesity, using artificial intelligence as assistants to perform tasks like checking symptoms and scheduling appointments, and finding ways to reduce the amount of paperwork associated with medical appointments by digitizing some tasks. Democrats and Republicans have tried before to make data sharing in the U.S. health system a more seamless experience, Bloomberg reports, though the technology was never quite up to par. Over 60 companies have said they will work on the new health effort and results are expected in early 2026."

    "full_text": "Microsoft just posted the fourth and final quarter of its 2025 fiscal financial results. Like clockwork, cloud services are the strong point of Microsoft’s revenue this quarter. Gartner said earlier this month that PC shipments were up more than 4 percent in the recent quarter, thanks to a Windows 11 refresh cycle for desktop PCs. While this time last year Microsoft’s Surface revenue had been in decline for two years, Microsoft started combining Windows and devices revenue together during this past financial year, so it’s still not clear how Surface is performing. Microsoft CFO Amy Hood did reveal on the company’s earnings call today that devices revenue is expected to decline next quarter, alongside a Windows OEM revenue decline in the “mid to high single digits.” Xbox hardware revenue is down 22 percent this quarter, despite a busy period for Game Pass. Overall gaming revenue at Microsoft is up 10 percent year-over-year, and has increased by $2 billion for the entire fiscal year. Server products revenue declined 2 percent, a sign that Microsoft’s customers are increasingly moving to its cloud offerings. Nadella noted on Microsoft’s earnings call that every Azure region is now AI-first, and all regions support liquid cooling.

    "full_text": "The next time you visit Yelp on your phone to check out reviews on the newest eatery, you may be greeted by an AI-generated video. The AI videos use large language models to grab text from reviews on an establishment and turn it into an AI-voiced narration (courtesy of ElevenLabs) and captions (courtesy of Amazon Transcribe). Then Yelp uses uploaded photos from user reviews to create a slideshow-like display of what you can eat, drink or dance to. As far as oversight of these AI videos goes, neither reviewers nor businesses appear to have any say. Companies can't see the AI videos before they are generated or offer input, and users can't decline to have their reviews or photos used, which raises a number of privacy questions. Viewers of the AI videos will have the choice to report a video as inaccurate or containing offensive content. Yelp has said that it will conduct broad audits of the videos, which will be periodically updated for establishments as more reviews and photos come in. Speaking to The Verge, Yelp CPO Craig Saldanha said that the company wants to create as many videos as possible, although your own activity on Yelp will dictate whether you see the videos and which ones are shown. If we find any way for you to opt out of having your review content -- possibly from years past -- used in these videos, we'll be sure to let you know. Yelp didn't immediately respond to a request for comment."

    "full_text": "These open earbuds have been completely redesigned and look quite different from the original AeroFit buds, which also listed for $100. The second-gen Aerofit are not only more comfortable but look sleeker, sound significantly better and offer all-around improvements.

Soundpeats Air3 Deluxe HS: What makes these $40 Soundpeats Air3 Deluxe HS buds special is that they sound surprisingly good for open earbuds -- they're pretty close to what you get from Apple's AirPods 3 for sound (they're a little more behind the AirPods 4, which offer improved sound from the AirPods 3). They're also good for making calls and have a low-latency gaming mode. But they also have a robust feature set, including multipoint Bluetooth pairing, hands-free Alexa and ear-detection sensors that pause your audio when you take one or both buds out of your ears. The Elite 4 is missing more premium features like ear detection sensors and has a four-microphone array for noise canceling and voice calls (voice-calling performance is good but not exceptionally good). Geared toward both iOS and Android users, they are missing a few key features on the Apple side of things (there's no H1 or W1 chip), but they're small, lightweight buds that are comfortable to wear and offer really good sound. While their noise canceling isn't as good as the AirPods Pro's, they do have a transparency mode and they're decent for making calls. They feature very good sound, plus decent noise canceling and voice-calling performance."

Analogue’s 4K remake of the Nintendo 64 has been delayed again and again due to the US tariff situation. But at least you can get 8BitDo’s updated take on the N64 controller, which was announced alongside the Analogue 3D, while you wait. You can get one through Amazon in white or black for $39.99 and while it’s one of 8BitDo’s more budget-friendly controllers, its functionality is limited. The 8BitDo 64 offers the same buttons as the N64’s controller in a more traditional layout, but while it’s easier to hold, the lack of a second joystick limits its compatibility with modern games, which generally expect two. The 8BitDo 64 is compatible with the Switch, Switch 2 (after updating the controller’s firmware), Windows, and Android devices and connects to consoles, PCs, and mobile devices using either a Bluetooth connection or a USB cable. The 8BitDo 64 is available in black or white and works with the Switch, Switch 2, Windows, and Android devices. It also features more durable Hall effect joysticks and shoulder buttons which should help prevent it from developing stick drift over time. But if you’re not planning to use it with the Analogue 3D (someday), the controller will potentially only be useful for playing classic N64 games through an emulator or the Nintendo Switch Online service but your GoldenEye 007 muscle memory may not perfectly transfer over to the updated button layout. Nintendo’s own wireless N64 controller is a more accurate reproduction, but you still need to be a Nintendo Switch Online subscriber to buy one."

    "summary": "It was easy to view Substack's 2023 Nazi controversy as a kicked can that could turn up again. Well, white supremacist content led to another headache for the company this week. User Mag reported on Tuesday that the app sent a push alert to some users promoting a Nazi newsletter. The company told Engadget the notification was an \"extremely offensive and disturbing\" error.\nThe Substack newsletter in question describes itself as \"a National Socialist weekly newsletter.\" It includes \"opinions and news important to the National Socialist and White Nationalist Community.\" The far-right blog has a mere 757 subscribers. (That's a drop in the ocean compared to, say, Heather Cox Richardson's 2.6 million, George Saunders' 312,000 and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's 236,000.)\nGiven the newsletter's offensive content and relatively paltry audience, this wouldn't seem like something to promote. According to the company, it didn't mean to. \"We discovered an error that caused some people to receive push notifications they should never have received,\" a Substack spokesperson told Engadget.\n\"In some cases, these notifications were extremely offensive or disturbing,\" the statement continued. \"This was a serious error, and we apologize for the distress it caused. We have taken the relevant system offline, diagnosed the issue and are making changes to ensure it doesn't happen again.\"\nEngadget asked Substack for extra details or context about how the accident happened. It didn't have further comment at the time of publication. We'll update this story if we find out more.\nThe newsletter in questionSubstack\nUser Mag reports that those who clicked on the Nazi blog's profile received recommendations for a similar one. That one had a larger audience of 8,600 subscribers.\nOne reason social users were quick to pounce on the latest incident: It provides a symbolic callback to Substack's 2023 Nazi shitstorm. That's when The Atlantic dug up \"scores\" of white-supremacist, neo-Confederate and Nazi newsletters on the platform. Some were monetized.\nSubstack's policy is one of anti-censorship. \"I just want to make it clear that we don't like Nazis either — we wish no one held those views,\" Substack cofounder Hamish McKenzie wrote in December 2023. \"But some people do hold those and other extreme views. Given that, we don't think that censorship (including through demonetizing publications) makes the problem go away — in fact, it makes it worse.\"\nAfter weeks of negative press coverage and prominent authors leaving the platform, Substack relented… sort of. On one hand, the company removed \"some\" pro-Nazi publications. However, it did so without changing its policies. Instead, it said five publications violated its existing content guidelines. Specifically, they broke rules prohibiting \"incitements to violence based on protected classes.\"\nSome critics didn't believe that was enough. The Platformer's Casey Newton, a prominent voice who left Substack during the episode, thought the company needed to take more responsibility. \"Every platform hosts its share of racists, white nationalists and other noxious personalities,\" Newton wrote in early 2024. \"In some very real sense, there is no escaping them online. But there ought to be ways to see them less; to recommend them less; to fund them less. Other platforms have realized this as they’ve grown up. Here’s hoping Substack does the same.\"\nSubstack has since found its footing as a haven for independent content creators. Numerous journalists looking to build an audience sans traditional media have flocked to it. (Among others, that list includes Tina Brown, Jim Acosta, Terry Moran and Jennifer Rubin.) In recent years, Substack has added a Twitter-like social feature, live video and TikTok-esque vertical video.\nThe company said it had its biggest week during the 2024 presidential election with an 82 percent boost in paid subscriptions. It recently raised $100 million in funding.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/apps/substack-accidentally-sent-push-alerts-promoting-a-nazi-publication-191004115.html?src=rss",

An archived version of the rules includes \"misgendering or deadnaming of transgender individuals\" as an example of prohibited content under the policy. That line was removed on July 28, 2025.\nOpen Terms and other groups have interpreted the change to mean that LinkedIn is rolling back protections for transgender people.\nA LinkedIn spokesperson told Engadget the company's underlying policies hadn't changed despite the updated wording. The company's rules still reference \"gender identity\" as a protected characteristic. \"We regularly update our policies,\" the company said in a statement. \"Personal attacks or intimidation toward anyone based on their identity, including misgendering, violates our harassment policy and is not allowed on our platform.\" The company didn't provide an explanation for the change.\nAdvocacy groups say they are alarmed by the move.

    "full_text": "In Brief Cybersecurity giant Palo Alto Networks announced on Wednesday its intent to acquire identity management and security company CyberArk for $25 billion. The deal, a mix of cash and stock, marks Palo Alto’s entrance into the identity security space, according to a company press release. Palo Alto has been on a shopping spree since Nikesh Arora took over as CEO and chairman of the company in 2018, according to the Financial Times, which estimated the company has spent more than $7 billion on acquisitions since Arora started. The company’s acquisition of CyberArk is the largest to date. Some of Palo Alto’s other acquisitions include: Dig Security, for an estimated $400 million in October 2023; Talon Cyber Security for an estimated $625 million in November 2023; and Bridgecrew for $156 million in February 2021, among others. This is one of the largest cybersecurity deals thus far in 2025. The largest deal was Google’s acquisition of Wiz in March for $32 billion. Palo Alto Networks did not immediately comment."

    "summary": "After largely focusing Google I/O 2025 on the ways the company wants Gemini to change everything from searching the web to filmmaking, Google is finally ready to launch new hardware. The next Made by Google event is on the books for August 20, and Google has already confirmed what at least one of its new Pixel 10 phones will look like.\nGoogle remains as leak-prone as ever, so nearly all the new hardware the company is expected to announce has all ready been reported on in one form or another. With that in mind and after sifting through what has leaked, here's what Google will show off at the Pixel 10 launch even in New York City on August 20.\nPixel 10, 10 Pro, 10 Pro XL and 10 Pro Fold\nAndroid Headlines / Onleaks \nGoogle's invitation for the event says that the company is sharing \"the latest on our Pixel phones, watches, buds and more,” which more or less confirms the company will introduce a slate of products that's similar to what it launched in 2024. That means a Pixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro, Pixel 10 Pro XL and Pixel 10 Pro Fold are absolutely on the menu.\nGoogle's tease of the Pixel 10 confirmed what leaked renders have already signaled: the company isn't abandoning the new design language the Pixel 9 established. The pill-shaped camera bump and flat front display will still be present on the Pixel 10, and the real changes will be in the details, like for example, how the flat sides of the Pixel 10 join with the phone's back.\nThose subtle changes will apparently also include the thickness of the Pixel 10s. While both the Pixel 10, 10 Pro, 10 Pro XL and 10 Pro Fold will use the same sized OLED screens as their Pixel 9 counterparts, they'll be housed in thicker and heavier bodies, according to Android Headlines. Google's new Pixels are also supposed to come in new colors. The Pixel 10 will come in \"Frost\" (a royal blue), \"Lemongrass\" (a yellow), \"Indigo\" (a light purple) and \"Obsidian\" (a dark gray), while the Pixel 10 Pro / Pro XL will come in Obsidian, \"Porcelain\" (off-white), \"Moonstone\" (a bluish gray) and \"Jade\" (a light green). Less information is known about the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, though recent leaks suggest it'll come in Moonstone and Jade, as well.\nAndroid Headlines\nThe most visible external change that'll be introduced on the Pixel 10 is the addition of a new telephoto camera. The new telephoto camera is a 11-megapixel 5x telephoto, Android Authority reports, similar to the one on the Pixel 9 Pro Fold. Meanwhile, the Pixel 10 Pro and 10 Pro XL are expected to feature a 50-megapixel wide, 48-megapixel ultrawide, 48-megapixel telephoto and 48-megapixel selfie cameras. The Pixel 10 Pro Fold could feature a different lineup, with a similar main camera, but 12-megapixel ultrawide and telephoto cameras, and 11-megapixel selfie cameras.\nInside the new phones, Google is laying the groundwork for future performance gains with a new Tensor G5 chip. It's likely be much more power-efficient thanks to the company switching to a 3nm design produced by TSMC. Reports suggest the chip might not be all that different in terms of raw power, but the Tensor G5 is likely designed to be extra capable when it comes to using local AI features.\nWhile global tariff turmoil could justify a price increase, Google is reportedly keeping things consistent with the Pixel 10 family. They'll offer similar storage options, come in at the same prices and include the same freebies and incentives. The Pixel 10 will come with six months of Google AI Pro and Fitbit Premium, along with three months of YouTube Premium. Meanwhile the Pixel 10 Pro models will get a year of Google AI Pro, six months of Fitbit Premium and three months of YouTube Premium. The prices and storage options for the phones should breakout down as follows:\n\nPixel 10: 128GB ($799), 256GB ($899)\nPixel 10 Pro: 128GB ($999), 256GB ($1,099), 512GB ($1,219), 1TB ($1,449)\nPixel 10 Pro XL: 256GB ($1,199), 512GB ($1,319), 1TB ($1,549)\nPixel 10 Pro Fold: 256GB ($1,799), 512GB ($1,919), 1TB ($2,149)\n\nPixel Watch 4\n91mobiles / Onleaks\nThe third time was the charm for the Pixel Watch 3, so the main task Google has with the Pixel Watch 4 is to not squander the solid base it already has. Leaks for the company's new smartwatches have been limited so far, but renders of the Pixel Watch 4 shared by 91mobiles do suggest Google has a few changes planned.\nNamely, much like the company's phones, the new Pixel Watch seems like it'll be a little bit thicker and come with smaller bezels. The Pixel Watch 4 should be available to purchase in the same 41mm and 45mm sizes as before, but in new colors — including a Moonstone option to match the Pixel 10 — and with a brighter display.\nThe thicker frame will also help the smartwatch fit a larger battery and a new wireless charging system, according to Android Headlines. Rather than charge through a puck with pogo pins like the Pixel Watch 3, the Pixel Watch 4 will use a wireless charging stand that could fill it up even faster.\nBeyond that, Google has already indicated how Wear OS is evolving. The new Wear OS 6 update is debuting on the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8, and will presumably be available on the Pixel Watch 4 at launch. It includes built-in access to Gemini, among other tweaks. Given Google also manages the Fitbit Premium subscription, it wouldn't be all that surprising if the Pixel Watch 4 gets some exclusive fitness tracking features, too.\nPixel Buds 2a\nBilly Steele for Engadget\nGoogle launched the Pixel Buds Pro 2 last year, and it typically doesn't update its premium earbuds on a yearly cadence. So instead, Tom's Guide reports Google might pair the Pixel 10 with the Pixel Buds Pro 2 in a new color, and save its new hardware announcements for a sequel to the Pixel Buds A-series called the Pixel Buds 2a.\nUnlike the company's premium wireless earbuds, the A-series Pixel Buds have historically skimped on things like active noise cancellation to hit a lower price. There's little reporting on where Google will take the Pixel Buds 2a, but you can expect the new earbuds to come in some of the new colors being introduced on the Pixel 10.\nPixelsnap\nThe Qi2 wireless charging standard is available for all phone makers to use, but it hasn't been widely adopted among Android phone makers. Qi2 uses magnets to offer improved charging speeds, just like Apple's MagSafe, and the Pixel 10 could mark Google's adoption of Qi2 through a new feature called \"Pixelsnap.\"\nA report from Android Authority suggests the Pixel 10 will include the necessary magnets to make Qi2 happen, and will be introduced alongside a lineup of Pixelsnap accessories. New leaked images showing a Pixel 10 charging with a magnetic charging puck that looks a lot like Apple's MagSafe charger adds even more credence to the rumor.\nIf you need even more convincing, the Wireless Power Consortium has announced that its faster Qi2 25W charging is coming to \"major Android phones.\" It would make sense if Google's Pixel 10s were included considering runs Android itself.\nGemini and other exclusive software features\nGemini is Google's current favorite, and the company is pushing the AI assistant everywhere it makes sense. The last few Pixel Drops — Google's regular Pixel-focused software updates — have primarily included Gemini features. It would make sense for Google to include a few more software exclusives on the Pixel 10.\nGoogle is hosting the Pixel 10 launch event on August 20 at 1PM ET / 10AM ET. The company has invited press to attend in person, and you can read coverage of everything Google announces right here on Engadget.\nUpdate, July 30, 2:30PM ET: Added information on pricing for the Pixel 10 lineup and new details on Qi2 support.\nUpdate, July 24, 3:44PM ET: Added details on the Pixel Watch 4's display, new colors and charging stand.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/google-pixel-10-launch-what-we-expect-to-see-at-the-made-by-google-event-on-august-20-214510537.html?src=rss",

    "full_text": "A new startup called Germ is bringing end-to-end encrypted messaging to the Bluesky social network, allowing its users to have a more secure option for chats than Bluesky’s existing DMs. After over two years of development, the service is launching its encrypted DMs for Bluesky into beta this week, with plans to gradually onboard new testers ahead of a public launch. This allows Germ users to securely chat with friends from Bluesky and the wider open social web, including apps like Flashes and Skylight, but with added controls over the user experience. And that’s really what social media is today,” Brown tells TechCrunch. Xue, meanwhile, came out of Apple believing that the use of phone numbers and telephony is a dated technology to serve as the basis for secure communications and wanted to build something new. Today, Germ’s service works by way of a “magic link,” which is generated for you and pasted into your Bluesky bio. But in Germ’s case, they allow for quick chats. The pairing feature was somewhat finicky in our tests, but we are running the iOS 26 developer beta, which may be causing complications. Image Credits:Germ Network Instagram (opens in a new window) Given that Germ is ahead of the Bluesky team in building encrypted messaging technology, Brown is hopeful that Germ’s protocol could be more broadly adopted by Bluesky and others in the future."

    "full_text": "As part of a roadmap released earlier this year, PUBG developer Krafton said that it would let players create their own modes as part of an alpha, and it revealed more details about the alpha this month. This week, Krafton CFO Dongkeun Bae also discussed the company’s vision for “PUBG 2.0” in an earnings call. The game will also be “a gameplay platform” and Krafton is developing “wide-ranging modes under that objective.” It seems like this approach will be a lot like Fortnite’s, which offers a mix of Epic Games-made modes and user-created experiences. With UGC, if it’s opened up to the broader player base, players will be able to “create many different things” with PUBG. By opening PUBG — which is still one of the most-played titles on Steam — to different kinds of experiences, it could grow beyond just hardcore shooter fans. In some ways, adding user-generated content is a continuation of PUBG and Fortnite following similar tracks. And Epic is investing heavily in its Unreal Engine-level tools for making Fortnite experiences. But like with Roblox and Fortnite, PUBG players may have already invested time and money that makes switching over to a new game that much more difficult. One thing Krafton may also learn from Fortnite: this kind of player-driven expansion can take a long time. Epic has been working and iterating for years to build up Fortnite’s ecosystem of user-made experiences, and even then, Epic’s own modes are usually the ones with the most players."

The effectiveness of an app such as Sun Day depends on giving it accurate information about your skin type and clothing, and while vitamin D levels are one way to gauge UV exposure, it's not foolproof given that some people also take vitamin D supplements. Tracking UV levels is one way to help mitigate those risks. But there is always a risk of sun damage to your skin while you're outside -- year round. \"The app would provide an objective measure of that UV index and guide you in safer sun practices.\" \"I am surprised that they have not involved actual dermatologists in pointing out the true value and limitations of this app,\" she said."

    "summary": "Of all the new iOS 26 features that Apple previewed at WWDC in June, AirPods updates were only briefly mentioned. Studio-quality audio recording and improved call clarity got top billing, while the addition of a camera remote control was also quickly discussed. However, when the beta software arrived last week, it turned out there were actually more features than described at the event, making this a meatier update for Apple’s recent AirPods than initially indicated. I’ve spent some time testing all of the new tools, so here’s what you can expect when you decide to use them.\nHow to get the latest AirPods features\nAll of these updates are available for AirPods that have the H2 chip. Those include AirPods 4, AirPods 4 with ANC and AirPods Pro 2. You’ll have to download the public betas of both iOS 26 and the latest AirPods firmware to use these features. If you’re not feeling adventurous, all of these items will arrive this fall when the final versions of Apple’s OS updates roll out. That’s likely to happen for iOS and AirPods in early September, around the time the new crop of iPhones debuts.\nStudio-quality audio recording\nApple may have framed the voice quality improvements on its AirPods as a boost for creators, but I’d argue the upgrade will be a welcome change for all. Sure, people who create content will benefit considerably from what Apple calls “studio-quality audio recording,” but the improved performance in noisy environments is something anyone will appreciate.\nThe company hasn’t offered much detail on exactly what it did to produce higher-quality audio, only describing the change in an initial press release as the result of a mix of the AirPods’ H2 chip, beamforming microphones and computational audio. That last update is likely doing the heavy lifting here, assisted by Apple’s audio chip, of course. I asked Apple for more specifics, but have yet to hear back.\nImproved audio recording is available across iPhones, iPads and Macs, working in apps like Camera, Voice Memos, Messages (for dictation), Webex and more. Apple also says there’s upgraded vocal sound quality for calls, offering “more natural vocal texture and clarity” for Phone, FaceTime and other CallKit-enabled apps. As the voice upgrades are the most notable new features, I was eager to test them, and have spent the last several weeks doing just that (via the developer beta).\nBilly Steele for Engadget\nIf you’re recording in a quiet room, you’ll notice that enhanced texture and clarity Apple promised. In my samples captured in Voice Memos, there’s not a huge difference between new and old firmware, but there is a noticeable one. The bigger improvement came when I moved to a noisy spot. Here, Apple dialed back its noise suppression in favor of voice clarity. While you’ll hear the slight roar of background noise in my audio clip, I actually sound better overall. That’s a trade I’ll bet many users will gladly make over the highly processed, digital-sounding results AirPods used to give us in less-than-ideal surroundings.\nI also noticed that both of my samples with the new software were captured with a 48kHz sample rate. This isn’t new for AirPods audio recording/quality per se, but before this update some of my clips were still 24kHz — like my noisy sample with the old firmware. It seems like Apple is now defaulting to 48kHz as part of the overall sound boost, but that’s currently unclear and is something else I’ve asked the company for more info about.\nCamera remote\nThe less exciting, but equally handy update for AirPods that Apple announced at WWDC is the addition of a camera remote control. Since newer AirPods have either force sensors or touch controls on their stems, the company saw fit to let you use those to take a photo or start and stop video recording. All of these tasks are done with either one press or a press and hold (you select which one you prefer when you enable the camera remote function).\nFor photos, you get a three-second countdown before your device snaps the picture. This gives you ample time to put your hand down after pressing the AirPods stem so you don’t ruin the selfie. For video, there’s no countdown, but there is a second or two delay before the recording starts. So, if you’re quick about it, you can get your hand away from your ear before showtime. However, you’ll still have to reach for an AirPod or your phone when the time comes to stop recording, so there will be some editing to do there. This all works well, but just remember you have to enable the camera remote feature as it’s not activated by default after the firmware update.\nSleep pausing and CarPlay switching\nBilly Steele/Engadget\nMost AirPods users have probably fallen asleep with one or both of the earbuds in their ears. Apple’s update will add automatic pausing when you’ve dozed off to help you not miss much of your TV show or podcast you were watching or listening to. However, it’s unclear how this works. All we know is it’s a simple on-or-off switch, and it’s disabled by default. Some have speculated that it uses sleep data from the Apple Watch, but that hasn’t been confirmed. Since AirPods have accelerometers, it’s possible the feature may rely on detecting movement, but I’ve asked for a firm answer on what’s going on here.\nAnother item on the list of AirPods updates is automatic switching for CarPlay. This is supposed to seamlessly transfer the audio to your car’s infotainment system from the earbuds when your phone connects to your vehicle. Again, there hasn’t been much discussion of this, and my attempts to trigger it were unsuccessful. That may be due to the fact that it requires wireless CarPlay, but I’m not seeing specific options for this in my AirPods settings. I’m waiting for more info from Apple on this feature too, and hopefully I’ll have more details to add to my observations soon.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/ios-26-updates-for-airpods-preview-enhanced-audio-recording-camera-remote-and-more-173036046.html?src=rss",

Home pizza ovens are on a tear and present an excellent alternative to hot indoor cooking. Minimizing use of the oven and stove can help you avoid heating up your kitchen. Think of summer recipes you can achieve on your countertop, like Instant Pot pork carnitas. If you do end up using your oven or stovetop, make larger quantities than normal. For example, make a whole bunch of pulled chicken in your Instant Pot (which gives off very little heat). Then you can use the leftovers to make tacos, chicken salad nachos and other meals that don't require firing up your oven. That might appear easier said than done, but you could bake bread in the morning, or cook proteins and pasta dishes while you're making breakfast or an early lunch so they'll be ready to go for dinner. Plus, you can keep a fan on in the kitchen to move air around and cool it down. 1 rule for most summer activities, and cooking outdoors or in a warm kitchen is no exception."

After announcing plans to find and restrict underage users on YouTube, the company now says it will start detecting whether Google users based in the US are under 18. Age estimation is rolling out over the next few weeks and will only impact a “small set” of users to start, though Google plans on expanding it more widely. The company says it will use the information a user has searched for or the types of YouTube videos they watch to determine their age. Google first announced this initiative in February. If Google believes that a user is under 18, it will apply the same restrictions it places on users who proactively identify as underage. In addition to enabling bedtime reminders on YouTube and limiting content recommendations, Google will also turn off Timeline in Maps, disable personalized advertising, and block users from accessing apps for adults on the Play Store. In case Google incorrectly identifies someone as under 18, users can submit a photo of their government ID or a selfie to verify their age. The move comes amid a global push for age verification, with politicians in the US pressuring tech companies to make their platforms safer for kids, and the UK widely rolling out an age verification requirement affecting platforms like Bluesky, Reddit, Discord, and even Spotify."

If you’re a parent with kids in school or kids who are independently exploring their neighborhood for the first time, then there’s a good chance you’ve considered stashing a tracker somewhere on their person for added peace of mind. Skechers is making that a little easier with a new line of sneakers for kids that feature a hidden compartment in the sole, which is designed to securely hold an Apple AirTag so you can track your child without worrying about the tracker itself going missing. There are currently several different styles and color options in the company’s new Find My Skechers line, with size options ranging from toddlers to eight-year-olds. Lifting the sneaker’s insole and a fabric web liner reveals a plastic compartment recessed into the cushioned midsole that holds and protects an AirTag without inhibiting its wireless communications. You can already find a lot of AirTag accessories that let you attach an AirTag to an active child more securely than just slipping the tracker into their pockets, where it can potentially fall out while they’re playing. Skechers’ solution goes one step further with a lid on the compartment that’s screwed into place. That should help prevent kids from tampering with it and, given the AirTag’s compact size, make it safer for toddlers still experimenting with cramming things into their mouths. As an added safety feature, the shoes don’t feature any branding that hint at there being an AirTag inside them. They look like every other sneaker that Skechers sells, making them one of the more covert ways to keep tabs on where your kids are."

    "summary": "YouTube will be included in Australia's social media ban for children under 16, as reported by Bloomberg. The country's Labor government said that the site will be subject to the same rules as other leading platforms like Facebook, Instagram, TikTok and X when the legislation goes into effect this December.\nAustralia had planned to exempt YouTube from the forthcoming social media ban, on the grounds that it's an educational tool. This irked other platforms, with Meta and TikTok urging the country's government to backtrack on the exclusion.\nThis move didn't sit too well with YouTube and parent company Alphabet. A company spokesperson told CNN that this decision “reverses a clear, public commitment” from the government to treat the platform as an educational tool. YouTube Kids isn't included in the ban because it doesn't allow users to upload videos or comment.\nThe government said this reversal was largely influenced by a survey released by Australia's independent online regulator, the eSafety Commission. It found that 37 percent of children surveyed had reported seeing harmful content on YouTube. This includes stuff like dangerous online challenges, fight videos and hateful rhetoric.\n\nCommunications Minister Anika Wells recently spoke to the Australian Parliament and noted that \"YouTube uses the same persuasive design features as other social media platforms, like infinite scroll, like autoplay and algorithmic feed.\" She went on to say that she accepted the results of the aforementioned survey and that YouTube \"should not be treated differently from other social media platforms.\"\nThe ban originally passed at the tail-end of last year, though some of the details have yet to be ironed out. The government has until December to finalize everything. We do know that the ban puts the onus on the actual platforms to prevent children from opening up accounts, as they'll face hefty fines of up to nearly $50 million Australian dollars ($32 million USD) if they don't comply.\n“Kids, God bless them, are going to find a way around this. Maybe they’re all going to swarm on LinkedIn. We don’t know,” Minister Wells said. My hunch is that it'll be more VPN than LinkedIn.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/youtube-will-be-included-in-australias-social-media-ban-for-children-after-all-161707399.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Happy Gilmore is leaving Netflix, but it'll be streaming elsewhere starting on Aug. 1.",
    "full_text": "The biggest original film to arrive on Netflix in July was undoubtedly Happy Gilmore 2. The Adam Sandler sequel was 30 years in the making and marks the return of one of his most iconic characters, Happy Gilmore, a Boston Bruins-obsessed hockey fan who turns his mean slapshot into a professional golf career. Happy Gilmore 2 premiered on Netflix on July 25, and features most of the original film's cast. Sandler is joined by Julie Bowen, Christopher McDonald, Dennis Dugan and Ben Stiller, all of whom reprise their roles from the first movie. Sadly, some members of the original 1996 cast, including Bob Barker and Carl Weathers, have died, but new characters played by Bad Bunny, Kym Whitley and Benny Safdie debuted in the sequel. With so much hype around the new release, it makes sense that fans are clamoring to revisit the original, which dropped on Netflix July 1 and is currently in the Netflix Top 10. But you'll have to act fast if you want to watch the comedy classic on Netflix -- that's because Happy Gilmore will no longer be streaming there after July 31. But, when one door closes, another opens, while you may not be able to watch the original on Netflix after this week, the good news is that it'll arrive on Starz on Friday, Aug. 1 so you can catch it there. You'll still be able to rent Happy Gilmore on platforms like Prime Video and Apple TV, too. So if you're gearing up for a Happy Gilmore weekend, fear not, you can still stream both films, as long as you know where to look."

The approach, devised by Peter Michael, Zekun Hao, Serge Belongie and assistant professor Abe Davis, was published in the June 27 issue of ACM Transactions on Graphics and will be presented by Michael at SIGGRAPH on August 10.\nThe system adds a barely perceptible flicker to light sources in a scene. Cameras record this pseudo-random pattern even though viewers cannot detect it, and each lamp or screen that flickers carries its own unique code.\nAs an example, imagine a press conference filmed in the White House briefing room. The studio lights would be programmed to flicker with unique codes. If a viral clip from that press conference later circulates with what appears to be an inflammatory statement, investigators can run it through a decoder, and by checking whether the recorded light codes line up, could determine whether the footage was doctored.\n“Each watermark carries a low‑fidelity, time‑stamped version of the unmanipulated video under slightly different lighting. We call these code videos,” said Abe Davis, assistant professor of computer science at Cornell. “When someone manipulates a video, the manipulated parts start to contradict what we see in these code videos, which lets us see where changes were made. And if someone tries to generate fake video with AI, the resulting code videos just look like random variations.\"\nWhile the scientists acknowledge that rapid motion and strong sunlight can hinder the technique’s efficacy, they are bullish on its utility in settings like conference‑room presentations, television interviews or lecture‑hall speeches.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/flickering-lights-could-help-fight-misinformation-155829489.html?src=rss",

City officials have not yet disclosed the nature of the cyberattack, but the July 25 breach continues to disrupt city operations and some public services. Saint Paul is one of the largest cities in the U.S., with more than 300,000 residents, and is the latest in a list of major cities targeted by hackers and ransomware gangs in recent years. In a statement on Tuesday, Walz said he authorized the National Guard’s cyber forces at the city’s request to help Saint Paul recover from the cyberattack, saying the “magnitude and complexity” of the breach exceeded the city’s capacity to respond to the incident. The National Guard will help to “ensure continuity of vital services and the safety and security of Saint Paul residents,” Walz said. Saint Paul Mayor Melvin Carter said in a press conference on Tuesday that the city took its government systems offline to contain the intruders, which sparked a citywide Wi-Fi outage. Carter added that the city does not store much data on its residents, but said there was a risk that data on city employees had been stolen."

    "summary": "Mark Zuckerberg has spent the last several months and several billion dollars recruiting prominent AI researchers and executives for a new \"superintelligence\" team at Meta. Now, the Meta CEO has published a lengthy memo that attempts to lay out his big plan for using the company's vast resources to create \"personal superintelligence.\"\nIn the memo, which reads more like a manifesto than a strategic business plan, Zuckerberg explains that he's \"extremely optimistic that superintelligence will help humanity accelerate our pace of progress.\" The technology, according to him, \"has the potential to begin a new era of personal empowerment where people will have greater agency to improve the world in the directions they choose.\"\nZuckerberg, who has previously expressed a desire to build artificial general intelligence, never defines \"superintelligence.\" Nor does the 616-word memo explain how Meta plans to create such a technology, what it might help people accomplish or why anyone should trust the company to build it. Instead, he implies that Meta will be a better steward of this non-specifically powerful AI than \"others in the industry\" who expect \"humanity will live on a dole of its output.\"\nAs profound as the abundance produced by AI may one day be, an even more meaningful impact on our lives will likely come from everyone having a personal superintelligence that helps you achieve your goals, create what you want to see in the world, experience any adventure, be a better friend to those you care about, and grow to become the person you aspire to be.\nMeta's vision is to bring personal superintelligence to everyone. We believe in putting this power in people's hands to direct it towards what they value in their own lives.\nThis is distinct from others in the industry who believe superintelligence should be directed centrally towards automating all valuable work, and then humanity will live on a dole of its output. At Meta, we believe that people pursuing their individual aspirations is how we have always made progress expanding prosperity, science, health, and culture. This will be increasingly important in the future as well. \nLeft unsaid by Zuckerberg, is the fact that the memo comes at a time when he's been rapidly reorganizing Meta's AI teams. Last month, the company invested $14.8 billion into Scale AI, a move that allowed it to bring Scale CEO and founder Alexandr Wang into the company. The 28-year-old founder is now Meta's Chief AI Officer in charge of its superintelligence efforts.\nMeta has also been on a hiring spree for the effort, and has reportedly been offering prominent researchers eight- and nine-figure pay packages to come to Meta. In recent weeks, the company has successfully recruited high-profile talent from Apple and OpenAI, including Shengjia Zhao, who helped created GPT-4. Zhao announced last week that he will take on the role of \"chief scientist of Meta superintelligence labs.\" Just yesterday, Wired reported that Meta has recently turned its recruiting efforts to Thinking Machines Lab, an AI startup founded by former OpenAI CTO Mira Murati, and that in at least one case it made an offer worth more than $1 billion over several years. (Meta PR said some details of that report were \"off.\") All that is on top of the $72 billion Zuckerberg has said Meta plans to spend on AI infrastructure.\nDriving all this is that Zuckerberg has reportedly grown increasingly frustrated by Meta's own generative AI efforts. The company has had to delay its larger \"Behemoth\" Llama 4 model by months. Llama's struggles have also reportedly caused Zuckerberg to question whether Meta's AI efforts should remain open source, according to CNBC.\nIt's also likely no coincidence Zuckerberg's rambling manifesto comes hours before the company is scheduled to report earnings and tell analysts more about its plans to spend billions of dollars on new AI efforts.\nMeta's CEO also clearly sees AI dominance as an opportunity to end the company's reliance on mobile platforms, especially Apple, which he believes have been able to exert too much control via their app stores. In his memo, he explains that \"personal devices like glasses … will become our primary computing devices.\" A future where smart glasses are more important than smartphones would, of course, be extremely convenient for Meta, which has spent the last several years building smart glasses.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/mark-zuckerberg-shares-a-confusing-vision-for-ai-superintelligence-153944322.html?src=rss",

For me, there's also another element to keeping knives sharp that is enabled by the knife strip. Are you concerned about places in your kitchen where bacteria may be hiding? The most straightforward magnetic strip look: I've owned this $20 metal holder several times over. Wooden strips are also less likely to ding your cutlery should you accidentally set a knife on it blade first."

    "full_text": "These shoes don’t come with an AirTag, and they don’t appear to be an actual collaboration with Apple, but rather, a third-party product that Skechers has developed on its own. Apple only advertises its AirTags as products to keep track of items like keys, wallets, or luggage — not human beings. But parents have been using the technology to keep an eye on their kids. Unlike an iPhone with location sharing enabled, AirTags don’t have built-in GPS. Instead, they use Bluetooth beaconing technology to quietly signal their presence to nearby Apple devices, giving the owner of the AirTag an estimate of its location. This technology can still be used for nefarious purposes, however. Bad actors have hidden AirTags in people’s bags or cars to stalk them, which sparked a class action lawsuit. Apple has instituted some anti-stalking features, such as notifying someone via their iPhone or Apple Watch when an unfamiliar AirTag is traveling with them. Since Skechers only makes this product in kids’ sizes, it’s unlikely that these shoes could be used to surveil adults against their will — but the continued normalization of this kind of surveillance could have implications beyond childcare. It’s possible that Skechers or another shoe brand could make similar products designed for adults with conditions like dementia, who may unintentionally wander away from their caretakers."

    "summary": "In just a matter of weeks — if it sticks to its usual schedule — Apple will announce its newest collection of smartphones: the iPhone 17 lineup. And while we got a glimpse of what's to come on the software side of things during last June's WWDC event, we don't yet know what the new iPhones will look like, and what new features they'll offer. However, there have been several leaks and rumors about the hardware side ahead of the phones' official introduction. Here's what we're expecting and what we can reasonably assume we'll get from Cupertino in September.\nWhat are the latest iPhone 17 rumors and reports?\nNot all iPhone rumors are created equal, and all should be taken with a grain of salt. As August comes to a close, we've gotten a glimpse of a purported iPhone 17 \"spotted in the wild.\" \nI just spotted a test development iPhone in the wild 🤩🤩🤩 pic.twitter.com/iS3PtKWqxJ— Fox Pupy 🦊🧡 (@Skyfops) July 28, 2025\n\nThe pics, highlighted on MacRumors, show a black cased iPhone (17?) with the sort of extended top rear \"camera island\" rumored to be coming to the new Pro iPhones. Is it the real deal? The dual angles lend a degree of credibility in a social media landscape increasingly polluted with AI-enhanced fakes, but your guess is as good as ours.  \nBut that's not the only rumor. A \"tipster\" contacted MacRumors to allege three new iPhone Pro camera features: an upgraded telephoto lens with up to 8x optical zoom (up from the current 5x); an all-new pro camera app from Apple for photos and videos; and an additional Camera Control button on the top edge of the phone. That last one seems especially unbelievable, as it would be the third new button added to new iPhones in as many years. Do we really need two dedicated camera keys, in addition to the Action Button? \nWhen will the iPhone 17 series be announced?\nMost years, the flagship smartphones are introduced in September. It's a little early to have the specific dates; some years, Apple only gives a week or two of lead time between sending invites and hosting the event. But years of past precedent show that sometime in September should be when the 17 models make their debut. This family of smartphones may be the last to follow that trend, however. There have been hints that the introduction of the iPhone 18 collection in 2026 will be split into a pro-tier announcement in the fall and a standard model announcement the following spring.\nWhat will the new iPhone 17 lineup include?\nDesign leaks suggest that Apple is building an ultra-thin smartphone, likely to be named the iPhone 17 Air to match Apple's ultralight laptop designation. Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, often a solid source of advanced intel about Apple, reported in January that the iPhone 17 Air will be equipped with a basic A19 chip and will only have a single camera lens. It may also use Apple's new in-house modem, which was introduced in February on the iPhone 16e. More details about this development may leak ahead of September, but that's what we know for now.\nAn investor note from Apple analyst Jeff Pu indicated that the Air will have a titanium frame. If his reports are accurate, the lightweight smartphone will be the only entry in the iPhone 17 lineup to use that metal; the iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone 17 Pro Max are expected to be made of aluminum, which is oddly a lighter material than titanium. Other speculation had suggested that the Air would use a blend of aluminum and titanium, so the exact materials may not be known until the official announcement.\nEach new roster includes a base model, but over the years, Apple shakes up the variety of phones it offers. Most likely there will be an iPhone 17 and an iPhone 17 Pro. Apple has also committed to the size matters philosophy, and has been building an iPhone Pro Max option with an even bigger screen and better battery life; the 17 roster will almost certainly have one as well. \nThe iPhone 17 Air seems primed to take the place of a potential iPhone 17 Plus. Since the iPhone 16e was only just introduced in February at a surprisingly high price point, it seems unlikely that there will be a new addition to that lower end of the spectrum, the models that were previously called SE. \nAt the very least, it sounds like the iPhone 17 Air won't take away the charging port and rely only on wireless connectivity. Bloomberg said that while Apple had investigated making the iPhone 17 Air without a single port, the company (fortunately) changed plans. He also says that the rumored phone will have a 6.6-inch screen and include the Dynamic Island and Camera Control button. Finally, the price is rumored at $900 — likely more than the standard iPhone 17 but less than the Pro.\nWe've also gotten what seems to be a reliable look at what the color lineup will be for the new smartphones. Macworld reported that the iPhone 17 will be available in black, white, steel gray, green, purple and light blue. The iPhone 17 Air will reportedly have four color options: black, white, light blue and light gold. While the Air colors will be less saturated, the visuals for the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max will go bold. The options for the Pro models are expected to be black, white, gray, dark blue and orange.\nWhat will iOS 26 be like?\nApple upended its numbering conventions with WWDC 2025, and will match the name of each new operating system to the year it's released. So when the next wave of iPhones hits, they'll be running on iOS 26.\nOn the design side, the smartphone OS introduced during the big developer showcase took a contentious approach dubbed Liquid Glass. Apple has been scaling down the amount of transparency effects in the subsequent beta tests of iOS 26, but it will still have a glass-like visual.\nThe feature list includes big and small updates. On the more impactful side, the Phone and Photos apps have been redesigned. There will be several features leveraging artificial intelligence, such as live translation capabilities coming to Phone, FaceTime and Messages. Apple is also currently testing a sensitive content warning for child accounts that will freeze FaceTime video if nudity is detected by on-device machine learning tools. And the company is also launching Visual Intelligence, which will use AI to search for elements in an image.\niOS 26 also has a litany of minor, quality of life improvements. Group texts are getting support for polls. And for the slow risers out there, iOS 26 will finally let you escape the tyranny of the nine minute snooze alarm. \nThe next iOS is now available as a public beta. Here are our initial impressions of the Liquid Glass design and other new features. iOS 26 is compatible with all models back through iPhone 11.\nUpdate, July 30, 2025,11:08AM ET: Added latest leaks and rumors about the iPhone 17, and updated information on the iOS 26 public beta.\nUpdate, July 17, 2025, 4:40PM ET: Added latest information about iOS 26, possible materials for the Air, and the color options for the different models.\nUpdate, March 17, 2025, 2PM ET: Added details about the rumored price and features of the iPhone 17 Air.\nUpdate, April 11, 2025, 3:45PM ET: Added details from Front Page Tech's new video that claims to reveal details from a leaked iOS 19 build.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/iphone-17-pro-max-and-air-everything-we-know-about-apples-new-phones-153024282.html?src=rss",

Stages feel repetitive, filled with endless waves of weak enemies that die in one hit. But these fights are the only part of Ragebound that feels like it was designed with care. The regular enemies are mindless and mostly exist to knock you into pits, which cause instant death. With healing talismans and generous checkpoint placement, it's difficult to actually die. You can tweak settings to remove healing items or increase enemy damage, but that's about it. They just run toward you, then pop like water balloons when defeated."

Instead, their loot will scatter around them, making it easier for you to spot and pick up an item you need or want.\nAnother big difference here is legend stacking. You and your teammates will all be able to play as the same character, if you like. Respawn has retooled the Kings Canyon map for Wildcard, adding ziplines, gravity cannons and other fun stuff to the playground. Second chances will give you another opportunity to pick up the win if things don't pan out for you at first.\nIt's highly likely that Wildcard has been in the works for quite a while, but it's a bit unfortunate for Respawn that it's debuting the mode several weeks after Epic Games added a new, faster-paced battle royale option of its own to Fortnite. Rounds of Blitz Royale — which Epic designed primarily for mobile devices — can last just a few minutes each. Still, it's probably been a couple of years since I last played Apex, and Wildcard has me intrigued enough to dive back in.\nThere are plenty of other updates coming to Apex when the Showdown season starts, of course. Caustic will have a new ability called Field Research, while his gas canisters and grenades will deal more damage. Meanwhile, Bangalore's smoke canister will be able to breach doors and gain an EMP upgrade. In addition, Respawn is retooling the mid-to-late game with powerful passive abilities called Amps. These will allow you to unlock boosts like infinite ammo, extra armor and healing upgrades.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/a-new-faster-paced-game-mode-is-coming-to-apex-legends-on-august-5-150048274.html?src=rss",

    "full_text": "It’s almost time for another Nintendo Direct. A showcase of games from Nintendo’s partners that are coming to the Nintendo Switch and/or Switch 2 is set for 9AM ET on July 31 . The stream will run for around 25 minutes and you can watch it above when the time is right. This is a partner showcase, so you probably shouldn’t expect to find out release dates for Metroid Prime 4: Beyond or Kirby Air Riders here. Instead, we’ll hear about projects from third-party studios and publishers. Maybe we’ll finally get some details about Call of Duty games coming to Nintendo platforms, something Microsoft said would happen when it signed a pact with the company a couple of years back. And then, of course, there’s the small matter of Hollow Knight: Silksong . Yeah, yeah, we bring this game up every time one of these showcases happens.

    "summary": "Earlier this year, Lenovo released a more streamlined and potentially affordable take on its flagship gaming handheld in the Legion Go S. Unfortunately, the Windows 11 version came first, which wasn’t the one we were most excited about. Now, the Legion Go S powered by SteamOS has arrived, and oh my, what a difference an operating system can make. Not only does this model feature a UI that's much better suited for a portable gaming machine, it has faster performance as well. But the best part is that the SteamOS variant is less expensive than its Windows sibling. All of this makes for a handheld that's a welcome alternative to the Steam Deck, especially for anyone who's not a fan of Valve's hardware.\n \nDesign and display: Keeping it simple\nLike its sibling, the SteamOS version of the Legion Go S features a very straightforward design. A big difference between the two is that this model features a dark purple body instead of the white shell on the Windows variant. Thanks to its large 8-inch 1200p display and sizable grips, it's a bit chunkier than rivals like the Steam Deck or the ROG Ally X. At 500 nits, brightness is above average compared to typical handheld PCs. However, because Lenovo uses an LCD panel, colors aren't quite as vibrant and you don't get those pure inky blacks like you do on a system with an OLED screen such as the original Legion Go. \n\n\n\n\n   Sam Rutherford for Engadget \n \n\nI like that Lenovo included Hall effect sensors for its joysticks, along with a toggle that lets you adjust the pull depth of the triggers. Plus, the addition of a second USB-C port allows you to charge the device while keeping other accessories plugged in. There's also a pair of programmable paddles on the back and a handy microSD card slot for expandable storage.\nThe biggest departures from the flagship Legion Go are that this model's joysticks and buttons cannot be detached and its built-in touchpad is significantly smaller. This means the latter is better suited to moving the cursor around SteamOS in desktop mode or to navigating menus than it is as a true alternate control scheme while playing games. You also don't get a fingerprint reader, which I think should be a standard inclusion on handheld gaming PCs at this point.\nPerformance and software: Better with SteamOS\n\n\n\n\n   Sam Rutherford for Engadget \n \n\nThe Legion Go S powered by SteamOS is available in multiple configurations. Our $830 review unit features an AMD Ryzen Z1 Extreme chip with 32GB of RAM and 1TB of storage. Unfortunately, this means I wasn't able to run true apples-to-apples performance tests with the Ryzen Z2 Go-equipped version of the Windows Legion Go S I reviewed earlier this year. But given the lackluster results from that model, I generally wouldn't recommend any handheld powered by that chip, even though that version is significantly more affordable. If budget is a concern, Valve's Steam Deck remains the better option.\nEven though the Go S with SteamOS features the exact same chip, I actually saw slightly better performance here compared to the original Legion Go. With both systems set to a 15-watt TDP (total device power), the Legion Go S edged out the Windows model in Cyberpunk 2077 at 800p on medium graphics by pumping out 58 fps versus 54 fps. By comparison, the Steam Deck OLED managed 53 fps. And in Control at 800p on medium, it was a similar situation, though the gap was even smaller. The Legion Go S hit 29 fps, beating out the OG Legion Go (27 fps) and the Steam Deck OLED (24 fps).\n\n\n\n\n   Sam Rutherford for Engadget \n \n\nThe cause of the SteamOS model's improved horsepower is hard to pinpoint — especially as performance varies from title to title — but it's generally due to Valve's platform having less overhead and system processes than Windows-based rivals. And if that wasn't enough, the SteamOS UI is better designed for a dedicated gaming machine, as turning on the system boots you right into your game library as opposed to spitting you out into Microsoft's classic desktop view. There are also some minor tweaks in Valve's OS to support features like the built-in RGB lighting on the Legion Go S — something the Steam Deck doesn't have.\nFor fans of SteamOS, the main reason aside from price to pick a Steam Deck over the Legion Go S (or vice versa) is that each system features different performance targets. Valve's handheld has a TDP that tops out at 15 watts, and at lower power levels, it features better energy efficiency than the Legion Go S. This makes it more suitable for people who regularly play older games or less demanding 2D fare. Alternatively, Lenovo's handheld has a max TDP of 33 watts (or 40 when plugged into the wall), which makes it more adept at handling resource-intensive modern titles. So if you want higher frame rates (which you probably do), a Z1 Extreme Legion Go S with SteamOS has way more headroom to push pixels even harder. \nBattery life: Just a touch more efficient\n\n\n\n\n   Sam Rutherford for Engadget \n \n\nFeaturing a mid-size 55WHr battery, longevity on the Legion Go S when running SteamOS doesn't really stand out. However, I found that on average, it runs up to 30 minutes longer than its Windows counterpart across a number of titles. When playing Metal Slug Tactics, it lasted just shy of three hours (2:50) compared to closer to an hour and a half for the Windows 11 model (2:33). It was a similar situation in Elden Ring, where the SteamOS version was able to continue for an extra 15 minutes after its sibling conked out.\nWrap-up\nThe Legion Go S powered by SteamOS is a simple and well-built gaming handheld with an even bigger screen than Valve's portable and arguably better ergonomics. When configured with a Ryzen Z1 Extreme chip, it's a better choice for playing more demanding modern games without feeling forced to switch to a Windows-based device. It also has a more optimized UI than its Microsoft-powered rivals while retaining handy features like Hall effect joysticks and dual USB-C ports.\n\n\n\n\n   Sam Rutherford for Engadget \n \n\nWith Z1 Extreme models starting at $830 instead of $600 for the Z2 Go configs, though, it's not quite as affordable as I thought it would be back when it was first announced at the beginning of the year. But even so, it's nice to have options. And as just one of two handhelds on the market that come with SteamOS pre-installed, the Legion Go S makes an interesting argument as a bigger and more powerful upgrade to the Steam Deck.\n\n\n\n\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/legion-go-s-powered-by-steamos-review-a-purpose-built-os-makes-all-the-difference-120059561.html?src=rss",

If budget is a concern, Valve's Steam Deck remains the better option. With both systems set to a 15-watt TDP (total device power), the Legion Go S edged out the Windows model in Cyberpunk 2077 at 800p on medium graphics by pumping out 58 fps versus 54 fps. And if that wasn't enough, the SteamOS UI is better designed for a dedicated gaming machine, as turning on the system boots you right into your game library as opposed to spitting you out into Microsoft's classic desktop view. For fans of SteamOS, the main reason aside from price to pick a Steam Deck over the Legion Go S (or vice versa) is that each system features different performance targets. Valve's handheld has a TDP that tops out at 15 watts, and at lower power levels, it features better energy efficiency than the Legion Go S. This makes it more suitable for people who regularly play older games or less demanding 2D fare. Featuring a mid-size 55WHr battery, longevity on the Legion Go S when running SteamOS doesn't really stand out. When playing Metal Slug Tactics, it lasted just shy of three hours (2:50) compared to closer to an hour and a half for the Windows 11 model (2:33). It also has a more optimized UI than its Microsoft-powered rivals while retaining handy features like Hall effect joysticks and dual USB-C ports."

    "summary": "TikTok users in the United States will soon see crowd-sourced fact checks appearing alongside videos on the platform. The app is beginning to roll out Footnotes, its version of Community Notes, the company announced.\nTikTok announced its plan to adopt the feature back in April and since then almost 80,000 users have been approved as contributors. Footnotes works similarly to Community Notes on X. Contributors can add a note to videos with false claims, AI-generated content or that otherwise require more context. Contributors are required to cite a source for the information they provide and other contributors need to rate a footnote as helpful before it will show up broadly. Like X, TikTok will use a bridging algorithm to determine which notes have reached \"a broad level of consensus.\"\nAccording to screenshots shared by the company, Footnotes will appear prominently underneath a video's caption. Users will be able to read the full note and view a link to its source material.\nWhile TikTok is the latest major platform to adopt the crowd sourced approach to fact checking, unlike Meta, the company is still continuing to work with professional fact checking organizations, including in the United States. The company also points out that Footnotes will be subject to the same content moderation standards as the rest of its platform, and that people can report notes that might break its rules. The presence of a note won't, however, impact whether a particular video is eligible for recommendations in the \"For You\" feed.\nFor now, the company isn't making any commitments to roll out the system beyond the US. \"We picked the US market because it's sufficiently large that it has a content ecosystem that can support this kind of a test,\" TikTok's head of integrity and authenticity product, Erica Ruzic, said during a press event. \"We will be evaluating over the coming weeks and months, as we see how our US pilot is going, whether we would want to expand this to additional markets.\"\nThe test of Footnotes comes at a moment when the company's future in the United States is still somewhat in limbo. President Donald Trump has delayed a potential ban three times since taking office in January as a long long-promised \"deal\" to create a US-owned TikTok entity has yet to materialize. Trump said a month ago that an agreement could be announced in \"two weeks.\" Since then, there have also been reports that TikTok owner ByteDance is working on a new, US-only version of the app in anticipation of a deal. TikTok representatives declined to comment on those reports, which have suggested such an app could debut in early September.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/tiktoks-community-notes-era-starts-today-110041152.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "There’s nothing more frustrating than shooting the perfect reel only to realize that the audio sounds like garbage. For budding creators, it’s a frustration; for those looking to make more professional content, it’s a dealbreaker. Fortunately, the world of mobile-specific (or phone-friendly) microphones has exploded with great options in the last few years. Whether you’ve been tasked with recording candid moments at a relative’s wedding, shooting a friend’s dance moves or are a journalist out in the field traveling light — there’s an option out there that will be perfect for you.We’ve tested a wide range of popular microphones with a mobile focus so that you don’t have to. Below is our hand-picked list of the very best options for a variety of use cases. Some microphones — the wireless lavalier kind, for example — will be more versatile and convenient, useful for a number of different applications. Others, such as our musician or field-recording picks, are where we explore more exotic form factors such as shotgun mics and mobile-friendly desktop options. As always, above everything else is sound quality and general performance. The good news for you is that we’ve done all the hard work for you. Happy recording!\nBest phone mics for 2025: Best wireless mics for creators\n“Creator” is a broad term, but for the purposes of this guide, it’s anyone that wants to make videos or recordings to share on the internet. This is possibly the most exciting category right now with excellent options from brands such as Rode and DJI, but also some compelling budget options too. Once the domain of TV and pro productions, wireless lavalier mics are now the go-to choice for anyone creating in front of (or even behind) the camera. They usually sound great, offer hands-free flexibility and premium models come with extra features that will streamline your creative process. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-mobile-microphones-for-recording-with-a-phone-154536629.html?src=rss",
    "full_text": "They usually sound great, offer hands-free flexibility and premium models come with extra features that will streamline your creative process. The standard kit includes two wireless microphones and a receiver that connects either via USB-C or Lightning. The claimed range is over 300 feet (100 meters), but in our testing it’s less reliable after about 200 feet (60 meters), but that’s still plenty for most use cases. Ignore the unfamiliar brand name; this mic provides great sound and reliability at a price that’s hard to argue with. James Trew for Engadget Best shotgun mic for most people Rode VideoMic NTG Of all Rode’s numerous shotgun mics, the VideoMic NTG is the one I keep going to when I need something that will get almost any job done. Older iPhones will need a USB-C to Lightning cable, but everyone else can plug right in and start recording. Shure’s companion app also puts handy features such as tone control, reverb and a high pass filter right at your fingertips. It’s a little higher-priced than other USB options, but as a dynamic mic it’s perfect for recording in less than ideal settings such as hotel rooms or cafes. The onboard microphone capsule is perfect for recording both vocals and instruments, and there’s a 3.5mm input so a fellow artist can plug into this to be recorded at the same time. There’s enough onboard storage for a generous 40 hours of 32-bit float recordings, making the Interview Pro completely functional without your phone."

    "summary": "Smartwatches do more than just track your steps and deliver phone alerts to your wrist. The best smartwatches go even further, giving you the ability to pay for a cup of coffee, take calls and connect to apps like Spotify all without whipping out your smartphone.Chances are, if you’re reading this, you already know all of the benefits of a smartwatch. You’re ready to invest, or upgrade from an aging accessory, but we wouldn’t blame you if you if you didn’t know where to start. There are dozens of smartwatches available now, including GPS running watches, fitness trackers that look like smartwatches and multi-purpose devices. Plus, you’ll want to consider factors like durability, battery life and operating system before you spend a lot of money on a new wearable. We’ve tested and reviewed most major smartwatches available today and these are our top picks.\nTable of contents\n\nBest smartwatches for 2025\nStylish smartwatches: Fossil and more\nFactors to consider before buying a smartwatch\nOther smartwatches our experts tested\nSmartwatch FAQs\n\nBest smartwatches of 2025\n \n \n \n \n \nStylish smartwatches: Fossil and more\n\n\n\n\n   Fossil \n \n\nYes, there are still companies out there trying to make “fashionable” hybrid smartwatches. Back when wearables were novel and generally ugly, brands like Fossil, Michael Kors and Skagen found their niche in stylish smartwatches that took cues from analog timepieces. You also have the option to pick up a “hybrid” smartwatch from companies like Withings and Garmin – these devices look like classic wrist watches but incorporate some limited functionality like activity tracking and heart rate monitoring. They remain good options if you prefer that look, but thankfully, wearables made by Apple, Samsung, Fitbit and others have gotten much more attractive over the past few years. \nUltimately, the only thing you can’t change after you buy a smartwatch is its case design. If you’re not into the Apple Watch’s squared-off corners, all of Samsung’s smartwatches have round cases that look a little more like a traditional watch. Most wearables are offered in a choice of colors and you can pay extra for premium materials like stainless steel for extra durability. Once you decide on a case, your band options are endless – there are dozens of first- and third-party watch straps available for most major smartwatches, and for both larger and smaller wrists, allowing you to change up your look whenever you please.\nFactors to consider before buying a smartwatch\nCompatibility\nApple Watches only work with iPhones, while Wear OS devices play nice with both iOS and Android phones. Smartwatches made by Samsung, Garmin, Fitbit and others are also compatible with Android and iOS, but you’ll need to install a companion app on your smartphone.\nThe smartwatch OS will also dictate the type and number of third-party apps you’ll have access to. Many of these aren’t useful, though, making this factor a fairly minor one in the grand scheme of things.\nPrice\nThe best smartwatches generally cost between $300 and $400. Compared to budget smartwatches, which cost between $100 and $250, these pricier devices have advanced operating systems, communications, music and fitness features. They also often include perks like onboard GPS tracking, music storage and NFC, AMOLED displays, and long battery life, things that budget devices generally don’t have.\nSome companies make specialized fitness watches: Those can easily run north of $500, and we’d only recommend them to serious athletes. Luxury smartwatches from brands like TAG Heuer and Hublot can also reach sky-high prices, but we wouldn’t endorse any of them. These devices can cost more than $1,000, and you’re usually paying for little more than a brand name and some needlessly exotic selection of build materials.\nBattery life\nBattery life remains one of our biggest complaints about smartwatches, but there’s hope as of late. You can expect two full days from Apple Watches and most Wear OS devices. Watches using the Snapdragon Wear 3100 processor support extended battery modes that promise up to five days of battery life on a charge — if you’re willing to shut off most features aside from, you know, displaying the time. Other models can last five to seven days, but they usually have fewer features and lower-quality displays. Meanwhile, some fitness watches can last weeks on a single charge. If long battery life is a priority for you, it’s worth checking out the watch’s specs beforehand to see what the manufacturer estimates.\nCommunication\nAny smartwatch worth considering delivers call, text and app notifications to your wrist. Call and text alerts are self explanatory, but if those mean a lot to you, consider a watch with LTE. They’re more expensive than their WiFi-only counterparts, but cellular connectivity allows the smartwatch to take and receive phone calls, and do the same with text messages, without your device nearby. As far as app alerts go, getting them delivered to your wrist will let you glance down to the watch face and see if you absolutely need to check your phone right now.\nFitness tracking\nActivity tracking is a big reason why people turn to smartwatches. An all-purpose timepiece should function as a fitness tracker, logging your steps, calories and workouts, and most of today’s wearables have a heart rate monitor as well.\nMany smartwatches' fitness features include a built-in GPS, which is useful for tracking distance for runs and bike rides. Swimmers will want something water resistant, and thankfully most all-purpose devices now can withstand at least a dunk in the pool. Some smartwatches from companies like Garmin are more fitness focused than others and tend to offer more advanced features like heart-rate-variance tracking, recovery time estimation, onboard maps and more.\nHealth tracking on smartwatches has also seen advances over the years. Both Apple and Fitbit devices can estimate blood oxygen levels and measure ECGs. But the more affordable the smartwatch, the less likely it is that it has these kinds of advanced health tracking features; if collecting those kinds of wellness metrics is important to you, you’ll have to pay for the privilege.\nMusic\nYour watch can not only track your morning runs but also play music while you’re exercising. Many smartwatches let you save your music locally, so you can connect wireless earbuds via Bluetooth and listen to tunes without bringing your phone. Those that don’t have onboard storage for music usually have on-watch music controls, so you can control playback without whipping out your phone. And if your watch has LTE, local saving isn’t required — you’ll be able to stream music directly from the watch to your paired earbuds.\nDisplays\nMost wearables have touchscreens and we recommend getting one that has a full-color touchscreen. Some flagships like the Apple Watch have LTPO displays, which stands for low-temperature polycrystalline oxide. These panels have faster response times and are more power efficient, resulting in a smoother experience when one interacts with the touchscreen and, in some cases, longer battery lives.\nYou won’t see significant gains with the latter, though, because the extra battery essentially gets used up when these devices have always-on displays, as most flagship wearables do today. Some smartwatches have this feature on by default while others let you enable it via tweaked settings. This smart feature allows you to glance down at your watch to check the time, health stats or any other information you’ve set it to show on its watchface without lifting your wrist. This will no doubt affect your device’s battery life, but thankfully most always-on modes dim the display’s brightness so it’s not running at its peak unnecessarily. Cheaper devices won’t have this feature; instead, their touchscreens will automatically turn off to conserve battery life and you’ll have to intentionally check your watch to turn on the display again.\nNFC\nMany new smartwatches have NFC, letting you pay for things without your wallet using contactless payments. After saving your credit or debit card information, you can hold your smartwatch up to an NFC reader to pay for a cup of coffee on your way home from a run. Keep in mind that different watches use different payment systems: Apple Watches use Apple Pay, Wear OS devices use Google Pay, Samsung devices use Samsung Pay and so forth.\nApple Pay is one of the most popular NFC payment systems, with support for multiple banks and credit cards in 72 different countries, while Samsung and Google Pay work in fewer regions. It’s also important to note that both NFC payment support varies by device as well for both Samsung and Google’s systems.\nOther smartwatches our experts tested\nApple Watch Ultra 2\nThe Apple Watch Ultra 2 is probably overkill for most people, but it has a ton of extra features like extra waterproofing to track diving, an even more accurate GPS and the biggest battery of any Apple Watch to date. Apple designed it for the most rugged among us, but for your average person, it likely has more features than they'd ever need. If you’re particularly clumsy, however, its high level of durability could be a great reason to consider the Apple Watch Ultra 2.\nApple Watch SE\nThe Apple Watch SE is less feature-rich than the flagship model, but it will probably suffice for most people. We actually regard the Watch SE as the best smartwatch option for first-time buyers, or people on stricter budgets. You’ll get all the core Apple Watch features as well as things like fall and crash detection, noise monitoring and Emergency SOS, but you’ll have to do without more advanced hardware perks like an always-on display, a blood oxygen sensor, an ECG monitor and a skin temperature sensor.\nGarmin Forerunner 745\nGarmin watches in general can be great options for the most active among us. The Garmin Forerunner 745 is an excellent GPS running watch for serious athletes or those who prize battery life above all else. When we tested it, we found it to provide accurate distance tracking, a killer 16-hour battery life with GPS turned on (up to seven days without it) and support for onboard music storage and Garmin Pay.\nAmazfit Bip 6\nThe Amazfit Bip 6, an $80 smartwatch from Zepp Health, didn’t quite make the cut. As a fitness tracker, it’s decent, but it’s a frustrating smartwatch. For workouts, the built-in GPS tracks runs and rides without your phone and, combined with the heart rate and blood oxygen sensors, collects a good amount of data to create accurate pictures of your exertion levels, cadence and pace. It’s remarkably lightweight but doesn’t feel cheap and the AMOLED screen is bright and sharp. It’s not an always-on display, but lifting your wrist wakes it reliably.\nThe sleep tracking data is on par with what we measured on other smartwatches and there’s even a daily readiness score that compares your sleep quality and the previous day’s exertion to estimate how physically prepared you are for the day ahead — similar to what Pixel Watches, Fitbit devices and Garmin watches offer. And since the watch battery lasts for over a week on a charge, you may be a lot more apt to wear it to bed than a watch you have to charge daily.\nWe weren’t expecting an $80 device to be a serious Apple Watch challenger, but the Bip 6’s glitches and overly complicated interface (both on the app and on the watch itself) were disappointing. During a week of testing, I got multiple repeated notifications, even after they were deleted, along with suggestions to stand when I was actively doing chores around the house. The watch faces are not customizable, so it was hard to get the info I needed at a glance (the Zepp app has lots of paid watch faces that may have what I wanted, but I didn’t want to pay $3 for something that’s free elsewhere).\nMarketing details state that the Bip 6 can auto-detect workouts, including walking and bike riding. During testing, I walked once or twice per day for over one mile and went on two bike rides, but no workout was ever detected. The watch integrates with Apple Health, so I was able to see how it compares to the data my Apple Watch gathers. After a week of wearing the Bip 6, with no changes to my daily routine, I averaged 400 fewer calories burned and 2.4 fewer miles tracked each day. That was possibly the biggest disappointment of all. — Amy Skorheim, Senior Reporter\nSmartwatch FAQs\nIs there a difference between a smartwatch and a fitness tracker?\nWhile smartwatches and fitness trackers share some similarities, they’re designed for slightly different purposes.\nA fitness tracker is primarily focused on health and activity tracking. It keeps tabs on your steps, heart rate, sleep and workouts, and some even offer advanced metrics like blood oxygen levels and stress tracking. Fitness trackers are generally more compact, have longer battery life and are built with activity in mind.\nA smartwatch, on the other hand, is like a mini smartphone on your wrist. It offers fitness tracking features, but also lets you do things like reply to texts, take calls, use apps and control smart home devices. Many smartwatches support voice assistants, mobile payments and even LTE connectivity, so you can leave your phone behind in some cases.\nIf you mainly want health and activity tracking with long battery life, a fitness tracker is the way to go. If you want a more connected experience with extra features, a smartwatch is the better choice.\nHow long do smartwatches last?\nHow long a smartwatch lasts mostly depends on two things: battery life and overall durability.\nSmartwatch battery life varies a lot depending on the brand, features and how you use it. Basic models with e-ink displays or monochrome screens can last a week or more, while full-featured smartwatches like the Apple Watch or Samsung Galaxy Watch usually need a charge every day or two. If you're using features like always-on display, GPS tracking or LTE connectivity, expect the battery to drain faster.\nPhysically, a good smartwatch should last several years before you need to upgrade. Premium models with scratch-resistant glass, water resistance and strong build materials tend to hold up well over time. However, software support matters too — brands like Apple and Samsung typically provide updates for at least a few years, while some budget smartwatches may not get long-term software support.\nYou can expect to charge most smartwatches daily or every few days, and if you take care of them, they should last 3-5 years before an upgrade is necessary.\nHow much should you spend on a smartwatch?\nHow much you should spend on a smartwatch depends on what features you need and how often you plan to use it.\nIf you just want the basics — step tracking, notifications, heart rate monitoring and basic fitness tracking — you can find some solid budget-friendly options from brands like Amazfit, Fitbit and some Wear OS models. These usually have decent battery life but may lack premium features like LTE, advanced health tracking or third-party apps.\nIn the mid-range smartwatch price bracket, you’ll find popular models like the Apple Watch SE and Fitbit Versa series. These offer a good mix of fitness tracking, smart features and design quality. You’ll get better build materials, more accurate sensors and app support, but battery life might still be limited to a day or two.\nHigh-end smartwatches like the Apple Watch Ultra, Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra and Garmin Fenix/Epix series offer advanced health tracking, rugged designs, LTE connectivity and longer software support. These are great for serious athletes, outdoor adventurers, or anyone who wants the latest and greatest features.\nIf you just want a simple smartwatch for notifications and fitness tracking, a budget or mid-range model will do the job. But if you want a premium feel, advanced health tracking or LTE connectivity, it’s worth spending a bit more. For most people, $200 - $350 hits the best balance of features and value.\nDo all smartwatches have GPS?\nNot all smartwatches have built-in GPS. Some rely on your phone’s GPS, while others have it built-in for independent tracking.\nHigh-end and fitness-focused smartwatches, like the Apple Watch, Samsung Galaxy Watch and Garmin models have their own built-in GPS. This means they can track your runs, walks, bike rides and hikes without needing to be connected to your phone. It’s a must-have for serious athletes or anyone who wants accurate location tracking without carrying a phone.\nSome budget and mid-range smartwatches (like some Fitbit and Amazfit models) don’t have built-in GPS but can use your phone’s GPS when connected via Bluetooth. This works fine if you usually carry your phone while working out, but it’s less convenient if you prefer to leave it behind.\nSome very basic or budget smartwatches skip GPS entirely and rely solely on step tracking or motion sensors. These are fine for casual users who don’t need location tracking.\nCan you leave your phone at home and still use a smartwatch?\nYes, but it depends on the smartwatch and what you want to do without your phone.\nIf your smartwatch has LTE or cellular connectivity , you can make calls, send texts, stream music, use maps and even access apps without your phone nearby. However, you’ll need a separate data plan from your carrier, which usually comes with an extra monthly cost.\nEven without LTE, some smartwatches can still do plenty on their own, including track workouts and GPS routes (if they have built-in GPS), play music offline (if they support downloads from Spotify or Apple Music), may contactless payments with features like Apple Pay and Google Wallet and control smart home devices.\nIf going phone-free is important to you, look for a smartwatch with LTE and built-in GPS for the best experience.\nCan a smartwatch make calls without a phone?\nYes, a smartwatch can make calls without a phone — but only if it has the right features.\nSome smartwatches have built-in LTE connectivity, meaning they can work independently from your phone. You can make and receive calls, send texts, stream music and use apps as long as you have a mobile data plan for the watch. However, you’ll need to pay for a separate cellular plan and battery life drains faster when using LTE.\nIf your smartwatch doesn’t have LTE, it can still make calls, but only when connected to your phone via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi. It essentially acts as a remote speaker and microphone for your phone’s calls. Watches like the standard Apple Watch or Samsung Galaxy Watch (Wi-Fi versions) can do this. However, if your phone isn’t nearby or connected to Wi-Fi, calling won’t work.\nSome fitness-focused smartwatches (like certain Garmin, Fitbit and Amazfit models) don’t have a built-in speaker or microphone, so they can’t make or receive calls at all — only show notifications.\nIf calling without a phone is a must, make sure to choose an LTE model with a built-in mic and speaker.\nWhat's the difference between an Android and Apple smartwatch?\nThe biggest difference between Android and Apple smartwatches comes down to compatibility, features and ecosystem integration.\nApple smartwatches (Apple Watch) only work with iPhones. If you have an Android phone, you can’t use an Apple Watch at all. Android smartwatches (Wear OS, Samsung Galaxy, Garmin etc.) mostly work with Android phones, but some also support iPhones with limited features. If you have an iPhone, the Apple Watch is the best choice. If you have an Android phone, go for a Wear OS or Samsung Galaxy Watch.\nApple Watch (watchOS) has the best app support with seamless integration into Apple’s ecosystem (iMessage, FaceTime, Apple Pay, Apple Fitness+, Siri etc.). Android smartwatches offer more variety, with access to Google services (Google Assistant, Google Wallet and Google Maps), and some support Amazon Alexa or Samsung’s Bixby.\nIn terms of design, Apple Watch has a single design but comes in different sizes and materials. It’s sleek, but your only real customization comes from bands and watch faces. Android smartwatches, on the other hand, come in tons of styles and brands (Samsung, Google Pixel Watch, Garmin, Fossil etc.), meaning you can pick a round watch, a rugged design or a luxury-looking model.\nIf battery life is important to you, the Apple Watch lasts about a day or two per charge, depending on usage and model. Many Android smartwatches (especially Garmin, Amazfit or Mobvoi TicWatch) last multiple days or even weeks on a single charge.\nGeorgie Peru contributed to this report.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wearables/best-smartwatches-153013118.html?src=rss",
    "full_text": "This new feature allows the Watch to track breathing during sleep and note any disturbances in a 30-day period. The company claims you’ll get up to 19 hours of battery life with continuous GPS use, which should be enough for most runners and athletes competing in long-haul races. We think this will probably benefit beginner runners the most — those accustomed to coaching may not find it as useful. Some companies make specialized fitness watches: Those can easily run north of $500, and we’d only recommend them to serious athletes. Luxury smartwatches from brands like TAG Heuer and Hublot can also reach sky-high prices, but we wouldn’t endorse any of them. Swimmers will want something water resistant, and thankfully most all-purpose devices now can withstand at least a dunk in the pool. The Garmin Forerunner 745 is an excellent GPS running watch for serious athletes or those who prize battery life above all else. If you mainly want health and activity tracking with long battery life, a fitness tracker is the way to go. These usually have decent battery life but may lack premium features like LTE, advanced health tracking or third-party apps. However, you’ll need to pay for a separate cellular plan and battery life drains faster when using LTE."

    "summary": "Elgato just introduced a novel new webcam with a pro-grade feature. The Facecam 4K allows users to mount lens filters for unique effects. This is the first time a webcam has offered this functionality.\nThe camera integrates with any 49mm lens filter, which opens up a world of potential. Folks could attach, say, a circular polarizing (CPL) filter to reduce reflections from glasses or go crazy with cinematic effects like diffusion. The unit ships with a free CPL filter to get started, as long as you buy the camera from the official Elgato store. \n\n\nAs for traditional specs, it records in 4K at up to 60 FPS and uses Sony’s Starvis 2 CMOS sensor with a f/4.0 aperture and fixed focus. It connects over USB-C and weighs just 0.26 pounds.\nThe Facecam 4K pairs with Elgato's Camera Hub software, which offers manual control over a variety of settings. These include ISO, exposure, shutter speed, pan, tilt and zoom. It also works with the company's Prompter hardware, though that requires a replacement backplate. The company is throwing in the dedicated backplate with new Prompter purchases. For the uninitiated, the Elgato Prompter is a nifty teleprompter designed for streamers.\n\n\nThe Facecam 4K even pairs with the Switch 2, which could make for some truly cinematic Mario Kart World reaction shots. Just update the firmware to version 2.32 or later and connect directly to the console.\nElgato's latest webcam is available right now and costs $200. This unit is similar in features to the pre-existing Facecam Pro webcam, but that one costs $300 and doesn't let people swap out lenses. It does, however, include a better sensor.\n \nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/elgatos-new-webcam-can-mount-lens-filters-163656839.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Google is updating AI Mode on desktop this week with the ability to process images, so you can ask it detailed questions about the pictures like you already can on mobile. In the coming weeks, the company is also adding support for PDF uploads on desktop, which could help you digest lengthy course or work materials. You can ask AI Mode to summarize the documents for you and ask follow-up questions that it will then answer by cross-referencing the materials you uploaded with information available on the web. Google says AI Mode's responses will also include links to its references that you can visit in order to dig deeper. AI Mode will support additional file types for upload, including ones straight from your Google Drive, in the coming months as well. \nIn addition to PDF upload support, Google is also rolling out a new Canvas feature that you can access if you're enrolled in the AI Mode Labs experiment in the US. You can use Canvas to consolidate all relevant information about a specific topic or for a specific purpose in a side panel that updates as you ask AI Mode more follow-up questions. If you're traveling, for instance, you can ask AI Mode to make you an itinerary and click the Create Canvas button. You'll be able to keep refining the itinerary with more questions, and you can always leave it alone for a while and come back to it later. \nAI Mode's Search Live is also getting video input on mobile this week, a feature Google announced at I/O 2025, after voice input arrived in June. To be able to access video input, you'll have to open Lens in the Google app and tap the Live icon before asking questions on what the camera sees. When Google revealed the feature during its annual developers' event, it said you could point the camera at a math problem, for example, and ask Search to help you solve it or to explain a concept you're having trouble understanding. \nFinally, with Lens in Chrome, you'll be able to ask AI Mode what's on your desktop screen. The company will roll out an \"Ask Google about this page\" dropdown option in the address bar \"soon.\" When you click on it, AI Mode will create an overview with key information on what's being shown on your screen, whether it's a web page or a PDF. \nUpdate, July 29 2025, 12:29PM ET: This story has been updated, as Google shared after the article was published that the image and PDF upload features will be available wherever AI Mode is available, not just in the US. That means those uploads will come to the US, India and the UK.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/google-is-bringing-image-and-pdf-uploads-to-ai-mode-160050646.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Sex toy company Lovense is leaking the email addresses of its app users and allowing account takeovers without asking for a password, according to a security researcher. As reported by TechCrunch, BobDaHacker, who describes themself as an ethical hacker committed to exposing and reporting security vulnerabilities, published an extensive report in which they accuse Lovense of failing to fix a serious bug it was first made aware of in 2023.\nAccording to the hacker (and later verified by TechCrunch), Lovense allows any username to be turned into their email address with the right know-how, a flaw they initially discovered after muting someone on the app. With their access to Lovense’s API, they were able to obtain the emails associated with any public username in less than a second when running the modified request process through an automated script. They noted that the vulnerable nature of these accounts is \"especially bad for cam models\" who use the Lovense platform for work, and may share their usernames for these purposes.\nThe researcher also realized that with a user’s email address (either one you already know or one obtained using the aforementioned disclosure bug), they could generate auth tokens that allowed them to take over the associated account without a password. This allegedly worked for the Lovense Chrome Extension and Lovense Connect app, as well as the company’s Cam101 and StreamMaster software — and even admin accounts.\nBobDaHacker said they initially reported the bugs to Lovense with assistance from the sex tech hacking project The Internet Of Dongs in March 2025, and received $3,000 in total for flagging them via the HackerOne security platform. After a series of interactions with Lovense representatives, they were told in early June that the account takeover bug had been fixed during the previous month, which the researcher claims is not true. Regarding the email disclosure flaw, Lovense said in a statement printed by BobDaHacker that it could take up to 14 months to fix the issue, as a faster one-month fix would \"require forcing all users to upgrade immediately,\" which it said would \"disrupt support for legacy versions.\"\nThe researcher went on to say that they were contacted by a Twitter user who claimed to have found the same account takeover bug as far back as 2023, and were told shortly after reporting it to Lovense that the bug had been resolved, which wasn’t the case. They said a patch eventually fixed their method, which used an HTTP endpoint to convert a username into an email address, but that it wasn’t rolled out until early 2025. BobDaHacker said they had requested comment from Lovense but at the time of writing had not received one.\nThis isn’t the first time Lovense users have stumbled upon privacy concern bugs. In 2017, a Redditor discovered that the Lovense app, which allows users to control their sex toys remotely, was recording audio without their consent and saving it to their phone. A commenter on the Reddit post, who claimed to be a Lovense representative, called the recordings a \"minor software bug\" that affected the Android version of the app and said at the time that it had been fixed in an update.\nUpdated 7/30/25 7:51 AM ET:  In a statement to BleepingComputer, Lovense said that a fix is rolling out in the app stores: \"The full update is expected to be pushed to all users within the next week. Once all users have updated to the new version and we disable older versions, this issue will be completely resolved.\"\nThe company's spokesperson stated that the exposed email addresses flaw was fixed at the end of June, although BobDaHacker says this issue still remains.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/a-lovense-security-flaw-may-be-letting-people-take-over-accounts-without-a-password-160528730.html?src=rss",

It does all the tidying and erasing you would expect, but also should provide a more realistic image. As Adobe puts it, there should be \"fewer artifacts\" left of the thumb, background people or whatever else you removed from the photo.  It's also available in beta on desktop and web. \nAdobe is also rolling out the Harmonize feature, first discussed as Project Perfect Blend during the company's October 2024 Max conference. Powered by the Adobe firefly Image Model, Harmonize \"intelligently analyzes the surrounding context, automatically adjusting color, lighting, shadows, and visual tone to create seamless, cohesive composites.\" Adobe claims this will reduce the time needed for manual adjustments. On top of trying out the beta on desktop or web, it's also available in Early Access for mobile iOS users. \nYou can now use the Gen AI Model Picker to move between the different Firefly Image Models, as they each offer something a bit different when using the tools. Plus, Photoshop is rolling out something else in beta called Projects which, well, manages your projects. It should keep all your files in one place and let you send out entire collections, rather than one version at a time.  This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/photoshops-newest-ai-tool-makes-it-easy-to-upscale-old-photos-135942810.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Apparently it's the season for great deals on Apple's MacBooks with M4 chips. First, the 13-inch MacBook Air M4 dropped to an all-time low of $799 (it's still on sale here). Now, the 14-inch MacBook Pro M4 has followed in its footsteps, going on sale for its own record-low price of $1,299. \nThe 19 percent discount means $300 in savings, compared to the model's usual $1,599 price tag. That deal will get you 16GB of RAM and 512GB of SSD. Though, if you're willing to spend another $200, you can get 1TB of SSD.  \nWe gave the 14-inch MacBook Pro M4 a 92 in our review thanks, in large part, to the M4 chip's speed. We also named it our best MacBook for creatives due to factors like speed, brighter screens and an upgraded webcam (12MP instead of 1080p). It also has a very long battery life, lasting for over 34 hours while playing HD video. \n \nAre you looking for something a bit bigger and faster? The 16-inch Apple MacBook Pro model is also on sale, albeit less significantly. You can get 24GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD for $2,235, down from $2,499 — an 11 percent discount. It's only available with Apple's M4 Pro chip and 24GB of RAM. The M4 Pro chip can support Thunderbolt 5, allowing you to transfer files at 120GB per second, compared to 40GB per second in the fourth generation. \nCheck out our coverage of the best Apple deals for more discounts, and follow @EngadgetDeals on X for the latest tech deals and buying advice.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/apples-14-inch-macbook-pro-with-m4-drops-to-a-record-low-price-130007054.html?src=rss",
