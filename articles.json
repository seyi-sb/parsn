    "summary": "With the launch of the Galaxy Z Fold 7, Samsung is getting closer than ever to perfecting its folding smartphones. The new model is a substantial improvement over the Fold 6 with a much thinner, lighter design, larger and brighter display and an improved hinge design that reduces visible creasing to almost nothing. It's also more powerful and comes with a new wide-angle camera that finally matches up with the mainstream Galaxy S series. \nThough it superficially resembles the previous model, Samsung has improved the Fold 7 nearly everywhere. That starts with the display(s), with the main AMOLED 2X main display (120Hz, 2,184 x 1,968) now 11 percent larger at 8 inches with up to 2,600 nits of peak brightness. It's also tougher thanks to the use of Corning Gorilla Glass Ceramic 2. The cover screen uses the same display tech and is also bigger at 6.5 inches compared to 6.3 inches, with a 21:9 aspect ratio.\nSam Rutherford for Engadget\nThe main improvement, though, is with the lighter and thinner Armor FlexHinge that reduces visible creasing noticeably compared to the Fold 6, addressing a key concern for buyers. It also boosts durability thanks to a \"multi-rail structure\" that evenly disperses stress. \nThough the screens are larger, the Fold 7 is lighter and thinner than its predecessor. Weighing in at 215 grams, it's 24 grams lighter than the Fold 6 and lighter even than the non-folding Galaxy S25 Ultra. It's also just 8.9mm thick when folded and 4.2mm when unfolded, a hefty 27 percent reduction compared to the previous model. \nUnder the hood is Qualcomm's latest Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy that boosts CPU and GPU performance by 38 and 26 percent respectively, while lifting NPU compute by 40 percent. Other key specs include 12GB memory, up to 512GB internal storage and a 4,400mAh dual battery (with wireless Qi charging and a 50 percent wired charge in around 30 minutes). Samsung is also touting its latest One UI 8 on Android 16 that is very AI-centric, as you'd expect, with features like Gemini Live, Circle to Search and Galaxy AI optimized for large screens. \nSam Rutherford for Engadget\nThe Galaxy Z Fold 7 also has updated cameras, negating one of our biggest complaints about the Fold 6. It now comes with the same 200MP wide-angle camera as the Galaxy S25 Ultra, though the 12MP ultra-wide and 10MP telephoto cameras are unchanged — as are the 10MP selfie cover camera and 10MP main camera. Still, at least you're no longer getting compromised optics with the principal camera, especially considering this smartphone's price.\nAnd the Galaxy Z Fold 7 certainly isn't cheap with another $100 boost in price compared to last year. It's now available for pre-order in the US at Samsung.com and elsewhere starting at $2,000 in Jetblack, Blue Shadow and Silver Shadow options. Shipping is set to start around July 25, 2025. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/samsungs-galaxy-z-fold-7-is-thinner-lighter-and-has-a-larger-8-inch-display-140054089.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold line has been treading water for a couple generations. But that’s changing in a big way at today's Unpacked event with the Galaxy Z Fold 7 boasting a dramatically thinner design, new cameras and an even larger flexible display.\nFor 2025, Samsung has significantly decreased its latest flagship foldable’s weight and thickness. Compared to the previous model, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 is 26 percent thinner, measuring just 8.9mm when folded (or 4.2mm unfolded) versus 12.1mm for the Z Fold 6. Meanwhile, the Fold 7’s heft has dropped to just 215 grams, which is down 24 grams from its predecessor. \n\n\nNow I’ve said before that the single-minded quest to make thinner phones is relatively pointless, but that’s mostly when it comes to standard candybar-style glass bricks. That’s because for larger devices, like those in the Z Fold line, more streamlined dimensions can make a big difference. And with the Z Fold 7, Samsung has created a device that’s essentially the same weight and thickness as the Galaxy S25 Ultra (8.2mm and 218 grams), which can be opened at moment’s notice to reveal a massive flexible display.\n\n\n\n\n  Sam Rutherford for Engadget\n \n\nSpeaking of the Z Fold 7’s main display, despite its newly streamlined design, Samsung managed to increase its size from 7.6 inches to 8 inches flat — which means you get five percent more room for movies, games and multitasking. Granted, that might not sound like a ton, but when the main purpose of a gadget is to provide a big display that still fits in your pocket, that’s a very welcome upgrade. And while its IP48 rating for dust and water resistance is the same as before, Samsung claims it reworked the phone’s internal design to provide more robust protection against liquids.\nElsewhere, the Z Fold 7 features a redesigned Armor FlexHinge that’s noticeably sleeker than before with Samsung saying it also disperses stress from opening and closing the phone more evenly. Additionally, the hinge has extra room inside to reduce the appearance of a crease, though it’s still there if you look closely or from acute angles. Durability has also been improved as the Z Fold 7 comes with Gorilla Glass Ceramic 2 (which we first saw on the S25 Edge) in front and Gorilla Glass Victus 2 around back.\n\n\n\n\n  Sam Rutherford for Engadget\n \n\nThe Z Fold 7 now has a primary 200-megapixel sensor similar to the one used in the S25 Ultra and S25 Edge. Samsung says this should help deliver “best in class image quality,” though because its 12MP ultra-wide cam is largely unchanged and its 10MP telephoto cam is still limited to a 3x optical zoom (instead of the 5x like in the Pixel 9 Pro Fold), I’m going to wait until I can properly test things out before making a final judgment.\nThat said, perhaps the biggest change to the Z Fold 7’s photo toolkit is that Samsung has gotten rid of the under-display camera it has been using since the Z Fold 3 in favor of a more traditional 10MP holepunch module. This represents a small retreat from what was once seen as a more sophisticated solution. But for anyone who regularly uses the interior camera for video calls and meetings, the improved image quality is almost certainly worth the small cutout in the phone’s flexible display.\nInside, the Z Fold 7 features a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chip, either 12GB or 16GB of RAM and up to 1TB of storage. Some may be slightly disappointed to see that the phone’s battery capacity is staying the same at 4,400 mAh, though Samsung claims the increased power efficiency of the new processor results in better longevity overall.\nFor longtime Fold fans, the most troubling downgrade may be that the 7 no longer supports Samsung’s S Pen. The company says it made this change because data showed that the number of owners who used stylus integration was “very low” and that by removing the dedicated digitizer layer from the Z Fold’s screen, it was possible to make the phone even thinner. This may be a dealbreaker for some, but it shouldn't really come as a surprise. Existing S Pen features have stagnated over several generations and after Samsung removed the dedicated S Pen storage slot from the Galaxy S Ultra line, I feel like the writing on the wall for the demise of S Pen support.\n\n\n\n\n  Sam Rutherford for Engadget\n \n\nBut even with the loss of stylus integration, from what I’ve seen so far, the Z Fold 7 is a major upgrade over the three previous models. Samsung has finally made a big flagship foldable that won’t weigh you down compared to an equivalent glass brick like the S25 Ultra. Its new main camera sensor offers a huge jump in resolution while refinements like a faster chip and its streamlined design contribute to a much more well-rounded package. The one issue is that starting at $2,000, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 remains prohibitively expensive.\n\n\n\n\n  Sam Rutherford for Engadget\n \n\nThe Galaxy Z Fold 7 is available for pre-order today, with official sales slated to begin on July 25. It will be available in three main colors: blue, silver and black, along with mint, which will be an online exclusive at Samsung.com.\n\n\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-hands-on-the-big-design-revamp-weve-been-waiting-for-140049475.html?src=rss",
    "full_text": "The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold line has been treading water for a couple generations. But that’s changing in a big way at today's Unpacked event with the Galaxy Z Fold 7 boasting a dramatically thinner design, new cameras and an even larger flexible display. For 2025, Samsung has significantly decreased its latest flagship foldable’s weight and thickness. And while its IP48 rating for dust and water resistance is the same as before, Samsung claims it reworked the phone’s internal design to provide more robust protection against liquids. Elsewhere, the Z Fold 7 features a redesigned Armor FlexHinge that’s noticeably sleeker than before with Samsung saying it also disperses stress from opening and closing the phone more evenly. Durability has also been improved as the Z Fold 7 comes with Gorilla Glass Ceramic 2 (which we first saw on the S25 Edge) in front and Gorilla Glass Victus 2 around back. Samsung says this should help deliver “best in class image quality,” though because its 12MP ultra-wide cam is largely unchanged and its 10MP telephoto cam is still limited to a 3x optical zoom (instead of the 5x like in the Pixel 9 Pro Fold), I’m going to wait until I can properly test things out before making a final judgment. Samsung has finally made a big flagship foldable that won’t weigh you down compared to an equivalent glass brick like the S25 Ultra. The Galaxy Z Fold 7 is available for pre-order today, with official sales slated to begin on July 25.

The Galaxy Z Flip 7 has a 4.1-inch Super AMOLED Flex Window, which is the largest external display on a Z Flip model yet. It's also the slimmest iteration of the Flip so far, measuring only 13.7 mm in thickness when folded, and has a larger battery (4,300mAh) than any of its predecessors. Since the new model comes with the AI features of Android 16, Samsung calls it an \"intelligent pocket-sized companion built for seamless interaction and everyday reliability.\"\nYou'll be able to access Gemini Live from its Flex Window, allowing you to ask the AI for assistance, such as to set a reminder or to find you restaurants to eat at, without having to open your phone. You'll even be able to point its camera at an object in the real world and ask the AI questions about what you're looking at and get answers on the Flip's external display. \nThe Galaxy Z Flip 7's main display is a 6.9-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2X screen that has a peak brightness of 2,600 nits and a refresh rate of up to 120Hz. Samsung says its Armor FlexHinge is thinner than previous generation's hinges and features a restructured design with high-strength materials for better durability and smoother folds. When it comes to cameras, the new model come with a 50MP Wide and a 12MP Ultra-Wide lens for both scenic shots and selfies. The Galaxy Z Flip 7 is also the first model in the line to come with Samsung DeX, allowing you to use the phone as a workstation. You'll simply have to connect it to a compatible screen for a PC-like experience. \nYou can now pre-order the Galaxy Z Flip 7 in the US from Samsung's website and retailers nationwide. It'll set you back at least $1,100 and will be widely available starting on July 25. The phone comes in Jet black, Blue Shadow and Coral with 256GB or 512GB in storage. It will also be available in Mint only from Samsung's website. Meanwhile, the Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE, which comes in Black and White with 128GB or 256GB in storage, will set you back at least $900. It's cheaper, but it's pretty much the Z Flip 6 equipped with an Exynos 2400 processor.

    "summary": "Do you even antioxidant bruh? Samsung’s latest smartwatch can help answer that question and provide receipts, should you need it. The Galaxy Watch 8 series, which the company unveiled at its Unpacked event today, comes with a new test that uses existing optical sensors to gauge the level of antioxidants in your body. That’s present in both the standard Watch 8 as well as the new Watch 8 Classic, which comes with the rotating bezel that has historically been popular with Samsung smartwatch fans.\nThe Watch 8 is also what Samsung calls “the thinnest Watch 8 ever,” which I think is supposed to mean it’s the slimmest Galaxy Watch to date. Despite the smaller profile, the Watch 8 also has bigger batteries, a new “dynamic lug system” for its bands, as well as other hardware tweaks like a brighter screen and a possibly polarizing “cushion design.” \nGemini comes to the Galaxy Watch 8 series\nThe Galaxy Watch 8 series is the first to launch with Wear OS 6 out of the box. With that, it’s also getting support for Google’s Gemini AI assistant. Theoretically, this means Gemini can do on the Watch 8 what it can on your phone. But at the large, busy demo area where I checked out the new watches this week, the Gemini integration was laggy at best.\nUsing the prompt suggested by Samsung’s reps. I asked Gemini to tell me “two cool things to do in New York City.” There was a noticeable multi-second pause before the Watch 8 Classic I was testing registered the request and showed the words on its screen. It then took another second or so for the answer to be displayed (we have a video of this sluggishness, check it out below).\n\n\nTo its credit, Gemini’s answers were fairly accurate, depending on your definition of “cool.” For example, it recommended the High Line park and an observation deck at Top of the Rock as candidates. But when Samsung reps and I followed up with “Add that to Samsung Notes” or “Add that to Google Tasks,” both of which are apps the assistant is supposed to be able to interact with, the system never completed either action. On one attempt, Gemini said I would first need to connect Google Workspace to the device, while on another try I got a more general error message. \nIt’s most likely the demo units were either failing due to spotty Wi-Fi or not set up for certain apps, and we’ll need to properly test Gemini on a review unit in the real world to see how responsive and effective it actually is.\nPreview of the new antioxidant test on the Galaxy Watch 8\nOf all the new features coming to the Galaxy Watch 8 series, I was most intrigued by the antioxidant test. It doesn’t require specialized hardware and uses what appear to be the same optical sensors that were on previous Galaxy watches. You do need to remove the watch from your wrist and place your thumb on the heart rate scanner on the underside, though, so this is definitely a test that can't passively track data in the background.\nSamsung says this should help you “gain insight into the accumulated antioxidants in your skin,” and you’ll receive recommendations on how to improve your score and tips on adopting healthier habits. The company said this uses its “bioactive sensor” to measure carotenoid levels so you can “make informed lifestyle choices,” and cautions in fine print that this isn’t intended for medical use. My ears twitched at the mention of “antioxidants,” which I assume is the effect Samsung was hoping for. They’re nutrients like Vitamin C and Vitamin E, and are generally considered to be good for health.\nI was frankly shocked and borderline offended to find out that in all three tests I ran on a demo unit of the Watch 8 Classic, my antioxidant index number was “very low.” I scored 38, 41 and 39 on a scale of one to 100.\n\n\n\n\n  Sam Rutherford for Engadget\n \n\nTo run the test, you have to open the Samsung Health app on the watch and scroll all the way to the third tile from the bottom to launch it. From there, you just have to tap the “Measure” button, swipe through three pages of guidance and then flip the watch around to put your thumb on it.\nAs the Watch suggested, I made sure my thumb covered the entire sensor and felt a quick vibration quickly after. I continued to hold my finger in place until the device buzzed more aggressively, which was a cue that the reading was complete. The process, after I placed my thumb on the sensor, took only about five seconds. I did find that my score jumped from 38 to 41 when I made sure to leave my finger firmly on the scanner for the full five seconds.\nYou can see your result on the Watch 8 (and this test requires a Watch 8 to work, which is possibly sad news for those who have older Galaxy watches). The Samsung Health on your phone can provide more information, and I noticed that the Z Flip 7 my Watch 8 unit was connected to was responding in tandem when I started a test. A small panel popped up on the phone’s screen, and the results appeared on both devices at the same time.\nOver on the phone, I tapped various parts of the screen to find more details on my performance, but nothing responded until I tried the small info icon to the top right of my score. This brought up a page with paragraphs of information titled “About antioxidant index.” It explained what “free radicals and oxidative stress” were, saying the harmful unstable molecules were exacerbated by “unhealthy lifestyle habits” like smoking, heavy drinking, overeating and stress.\n\n\n\n\n  Sam Rutherford for Engadget\n \n\nIt also included the World Health Organization’s recommended daily intake of fruit and vegetables, as well as a table explaining all the possible ranges of results on Samsung’s Antioxidant Index. The company said these numbers are based on analysis of “clinical trials at Samsung Seoul Hospital.”\nSurprisingly, the highest level is simply “Adequate” while those with levels below 75 get assigned “Low” (74 to 50) or “Very Low” (below 50). A footnote clarifies that “the above criteria may be adjusted based on future clinical results,” and this index doesn’t appear to be a scale used in non-Samsung medical settings.\nI’m not sure if my low number is the result of a lack of antioxidants or a high level of stress, but it’s certainly motivated me to eat more vegetables (I already consume a fair amount of fruit). I’ll need more time with a review unit to see if changes to my diet will make any difference and whether the feature actually is effective at motivating longterm consistent lifestyle change.\nWhat else is new on the Galaxy Watch 8 series?\nI’ll also have to spend more than an hour with the Watch 8 series to know how I feel about the updated interface, but my early impressions are positive. This was my first interaction with Wear OS 6, and while I’m not sure how much of the tweaks are exclusive to Samsung’s One UI overlay, I have to say the seemingly larger tiles and rearrangement of how information is displayed made the screen feel roomier. One thing I can say is certainly a Samsung tweak is the Now Bar, which sat at the bottom of the home screen. I didn’t interact with it much during my time with the demo unit, but so far it seems to display too little information at a glance to be very helpful.\n\n\n\n\n  Sam Rutherford for Engadget\n \n\nNew design and lug system\nMost of the other updates I was able to check out at the hands-on event were related to the hardware. I have to admit I wasn’t a fan of the so-called “cushion design” when I saw pictures of the Watch 8, which basically looks like a round screen encased in an aluminum squircle (squarish circle or round square?). The same goes for the Watch 8 Classic, except that its rotating bezel is large enough to hide some of the metallic case around the watch face, and it has markings in the bezel to denote time.\nIn person, I didn’t mind the new look as much, and was actually quite taken by the Watch 8’s thinness. At 8.6mm thick, this model is 11 percent slimmer than the Watch 7. Plus, Samsung says it improved the strap’s angle using a “dynamic lug system,” which makes it easier to swap out different bands and minimizes the gap between the watch and your wrist. Altogether, the company says these changes result in “11 percent more accurate heart rate tracking.”\nDo I think the idea makes sense in theory? Yes. Do I also find the multiple occurrences of “11 percent” suspicious? Extremely so. I’ll grant that coincidences can happen, and numbers like 11 percent don’t really mean anything, so I won’t get too skeptical about that right now. I will say it’s also very convenient (and weird) that Samsung said in a briefing that the improved “pressure uniformity” makes for a 12 percent increase in comfort, as if that’s something you can quantify.\nNow, the button to release the watch straps is on the case itself rather than the bands, which gives me a firmer backing to push against. But I could see it being an adjustment for those who have gotten used to pushing down on the strap and pulling away. You’ll have to buy new bands if you’re upgrading to the Watch 8 or Watch 8 Classic, though, since the system won’t be compatible with older straps or devices. That’s mildly annoying, especially when you consider that companies like Apple and Google generally make their bands compatible with new and old models.\n\n\n\n\n  Sam Rutherford for Engadget\n \n\nWatch 8 Classic’s rotating bezel and other hardware tweaks\nI also want to shout out the Watch 8 Classic’s rotating bezel, which looks more like a toothed gear than that on the Watch 6 Classic. When I tried spinning it to scroll through apps on the new Classic and its predecessor (there wasn’t a Watch 7 Classic), I found the later model slightly stiffer, but it wasn’t sluggish or difficult to use. I remain a fan of the mechanical bezel as a way to interact with Wear OS.\nI’ll run through a few quick hardware specs for the Watch 8: it comes in 40mm and 44mm sizes. These will have batteries that are 325mAh and 435mAh respectively, representing an 8 percent increase over the previous generation. Both versions of the Watch 8 have displays that are 50 percent brighter than before, up to 3,000 nits. The same goes for the Watch 8 Classic, which is only available in a 46mm model and has a 445mAh battery. Finally, across the lineup, the devices have what Samsung says is a durable Armor Aluminum 2 frame, and are rated 5ATM and IP68 for water (and dust) resistance, as well as MIL-STD-810H.\nSoftware, fitness and health updates I didn’t get to test\nI didn’t get to test some other new software features coming to the Watch 8 series, including vascular load insights, running guidance and bedtime suggestions. Vascular load requires you wear the watch overnight and it tracks your heart health while you sleep. Samsung says it will provide insight into your sleep, exercise and stress, and make suggestions for bringing down your vascular load\nMeanwhile, after you’ve worn the watch for at least two nights in a row, the Watch 8 can recommend an ideal bedtime, based on sleep and activity patterns. According to Samsung, prompts to get ready for bed will be delivered on the watch about two hours prior to the suggested window, so you’ll have ample time to wind down.\nOf course, I didn’t spend that much time with the demo units, so I can’t say how accurate or effective they are. I also didn’t use the Watch 8 enough to check out the running guidance feature, but it sounds similar to existing versions across the smartwatch ecosystem. In fact, based on Samsung’s description, it’s most reminiscent of the Workout Buddy that Apple recently announced for watchOS 26. Both will offer motivational messages, insights and real-time feedback during your workout. Apple’s does support more types of exercises, though, including biking, strength training and HIIT. It’s also unclear whether Samsung’s version will analyze your past workouts for the insights it delivers.\nAfter years of incremental updates, it’s nice to see a fairly significant set of changes coming to the Galaxy Watch series. As usual, I recommend waiting till we’re able to review these in the real world before spending your money, but if you’ve already decided to get one, you won’t have long to wait. The Watch 8 will start at $349.99 and $379.99 for the 40mm and 44mm (Wi-Fi only) models, while the Watch 8 Classic will cost $499.99 and $549.99 for the Wi-Fi and LTE versions respectively. All are available for pre-order today and will retail more broadly on July 25.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-8-hands-on-new-look-new-ai-and-new-antioxidants-140039472.html?src=rss",

For example, we knew the Galaxy Z Fold 7 would be Samsung's thinnest foldable ever, but now we know part of the reason for that is because the company dropped S Pen support. Samsung also announced updates to its family of Galaxy Watch devices. Here's everything the company had to share at the latest Galaxy Unpacked.\nGalaxy Z Fold 7\nSam Rutherford for Engadget\nSamsung kicked Unpacked off with its new flagship foldable for 2025, the Galaxy Z Fold 7. After six previous iterations, the company has arrived at its thinnest foldable phone yet, with the new device measuring 8.9mm thick when closed and 4.2mm unfolded. If you're curious, at its thickest the Z Fold 7 is only 0.7mm thicker than the S25 Ultra, and 26 percent thinner than the previous Fold. The new handset is also Samsung's lightest foldable yet, weighing in at just 215 grams.\nDespite the glow up, Samsung says the Z Fold 7 is also more durable than its predecessors, thanks to the inclusion of a new grade four titanium layer and a redesigned FlexHinge that should make the display crease on the Z Fold 7 less prominent. Speaking of the display, it's now 8 inches big, up from 7.6 inches previously.\nInternally, the new phone features Qualcomm's latest Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset and a 4,400mAh battery. Samsung has dropped S Pen support, claiming stylus use on the Z Fold 6 was \"really low,\" and part of the reason the new foldable is so slim is that the company was free to remove the digitizer that was needed to process stylus inputs. Storage starts at 256GB, with 512GB and 1TB configurations available.\nIn addition to being thin, the Z Fold 7 offers Samsung's best phone camera to date. The foldable has a massive 200-megapixel main sensor. It also comes with a 10MP telephoto camera with 3x optical zoom and a 12MP ultrawide. The company has once again tweaked the inside camera. It's no longer under the screen and offers a wider 100-degree field of view with 10MP of resolution. For selfies, Samsung has once again gone with a 10MP sensor above the phone's cover screen. Rounding things out, the company has updated its visual engine to support 10-bit HDR capture.\nPre-orders for the Galaxy Z Fold 7 start today, with general availability to follow on July 25. Pricing starts at $2,000. At launch, Samsung will offer the phone in three colors: blue shadow, jet black and silver shadow. Samsung will also exclusively carry the phone in a mint color. The Z Fold 7 will ship with Android 16 out of the box.\nGalaxy Z Flip 7\nSam Rutherford for Engadget\nSamsung's clamshell foldable has also received some upgrades. The new Galaxy Z Flip 7 has a 4.1-inch edge-to-edge FlexWindow display with 1.25mm bezels. That's good enough to give it the thinnest display bezel on any Samsung phone. Additionally, the new screen offers a 120Hz refresh rate and 2,600 nits of peak brightness. It also works with Google Gemini, along with Samsung's own suite of AI features, including Now Bar and Now Brief.\nOn the inside, Samsung has increased the size of the main screen for the first time. It's now 6.9 inches, up from 6.7 inches on the Z Flip 6. For context, that's the same size as the screen on the S25+. Samsung has also equipped the Z Flip 7 with a larger 4,300mAh battery. The entire phone offers improved water protection compared to its predecessor, and the new Armor FlexHinge should better protect the internal display against unsightly creasing.\nNow, I'm sure this will upset some people, but Samsung has decided to spec the Z Fold 7 with one of its in-house chipsets, the Exynos 2500, instead of a Qualcomm Snapdragon. I know what you're thinking, but the company's recent processors have been great — the Exynos 2400e was the best part of the S24 FE.\nFor photos and video, the Galaxy Z Flip 7 has a 50MP main camera, supported by a 12MP ultra-wide. For self-portraits, you can use either the main camera or the 10MP camera selfie camera found on the inside of the phone. Like the Z Fold 7, Samsung has updated the Z Flip 7's camera engine to support 10-bit HDR capture.\nThe Z Flip 7 is available to pre-order today. It comes in three colors – coral red, blue shadow and jet black — and two storage configurations — 256GB and 512GB. As with the Z Fold 7, Samsung will also exclusively carry the phone in a mint color. Pricing starts at $1,100.\nGalaxy Z Flip 7 FE\nSam Rutherford for Engadget\nIf the high cost of Samsung's foldables has kept you from buying one in the past, this year Samsung is trying to offer a more affordable way to enter the ecosystem. I say it's trying because at $900 the Z Flip 7 FE is still a nearly $1,000 phone. For that price, you get what is last year's Z Flip 6 with an Exynos 2400 processor and a smaller 3,700mAh battery. The design of the new model doesn't include any of the flourishes found on the Z Flip 7, including the edge-to-edge Flex Window display or the larger internal screen. For what it's worth, Samsung's Galaxy AI suite is included in the package.\nStorage on the FE starts at 128GB. Samsung will also sell a 256GB variant for those who need more space. This being an FE model, colors to just two: white and black. Like all of its siblings, the Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE is available to pre-order today, and expected to hit store shelves on July 25\nGalaxy Watch 8 and Watch 8 Classic\nSam Rutherford for Engadget\n\nAs expected, Samsung has also updated its wearable line for 2025. Starting with the Galaxy Watch 8, it now features a thinner design reminiscent of last year's Galaxy Watch Ultra. Like with that device, Samsung has gone with a squircle form factor. There's also a new lug system for changing out straps. As mentioned, the new watch is also thinner. In this case, it's 11 percent smaller than its predecessor. Despite the size reduction, the Galaxy Watch 8 offers better battery life, thanks to the inclusion of larger power cells on both the 40mm and 44mm models. The former has a 325mAh battery while the latter has a 435mAh one. A new AMOLED display offers 3,000 nits of peak brightness to make the watch easier to read in harsh sunlight. Samsung has also improved the Watch 8's ingress protection. The wearable's case is rated 5ATM and IP68-certified against water and dust.\nAs for software, the Galaxy Watch 8 will ship with Wear OS 6 out of the box, making it the first Samsung wearable to offer the new operating system. Included in the update is Google's Gemini assistant, which, thanks to AI, can better understand better natural language. New to the entire Galaxy Watch family is a feature that Samsung claims can accurately measure the antioxidant levels in your blood. To use the tool, you'll need to take the Galaxy Watch 8 off your wrist and place the device's heart rate scanner on your thumb.\nThe Galaxy Watch 8 Classic offers all of the enhancements found on the base model alongside the rotating bezel the Classic series is known for. This year, Samsung plans to only offer the Watch 8 Classic in a single 46mm size. That model comes with a 445mAh battery.\nSamsung is probably holding off on a proper Watch Ultra update for 2025. Instead, the company has announced a new SKU of the wearable that has 64GB of internal storage and the lug system found on its siblings.\nPricing for the Galaxy Watch 8 series starts at $350. The Watch 8 Classic will cost $500 and $550 for the Wi-Fi and cellular models respectively. The entire family is available to pre-order today and will hit retail more broadly on July 25.\nSamsung Wallet gets Buy Now Pay Later support\nSamsung also updated some of its software features this Unpacked, and one piece of news that might get overlooked is something coming to Samsung Wallet. After launching a Tap to Transfer feature last year and announcing Instant Installment in January this year, the company is sharing today that its Buy Now Pay Later service is launching with the Fold 7.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/galaxy-unpacked-2025-everything-samsung-announced-including-the-z-fold-7-z-flip-7-and-galaxy-watch-8-140023487.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Once again, it’s time for Samsung’s mid-year Galaxy foldable showcase. Over the last 10 years, Samsung gave us curved edges, curved screens, and then screens that fold (both ways). While we’re still waiting for that rumored tri-fold Galaxy, Samsung has primed two new Flip foldables, the Galaxy Z Flip 7 and (surprise!) the Z Flip 7 FE. \nFirst, there’s the Galaxy Z Flip 7. This year, the biggest change is a larger 4.1-inch second display with cutouts for the dual cameras. This occupies the entire front surface of the device and is a considerable increase from the 3.4-inch display of last year’s Z Flip 6. (It also looks a lot like Moto’s most recent foldable.)\nThe Flex Window is also better in almost every way. It can reach peak brightness levels of 2,600 nits (matching the S25 Ultra), has a 120Hz refresh rate and the thinnest bezel yet (1.25mm) of any Samsung smartphone. The front screen is a significant improvement over the Z Flip 6, but refinements also extend to the main display.\nSamsung has expanded the primary internal screen to 6.9 inches, up from 6.4 inches. It’s now in the more typical smartphone display ratio of 21:9. Previous Flips had a more elongated screen, making it harder to paw at the upper corners. This means video content fits better, too.\nWhat about the crease? Well, in person, it looks the same as last year’s phones, and, interestingly, Samsung isn’t hyping some hard-to-measure crease visibility metric. I did chuckle when the company said that it made the main screen’s ultra-thin glass “50 percent thicker.” The wording’s clunky, but it points to Samsung’s continued focus on improving toughness and longevity. The Flip 7 now has a new waterproof coating beneath the glass and AMOLED display. Once again, the hinge has been further strengthened.\nAnd yet, the Flip 7 is thinner than last year’s model. It measures 6.4mm (0.25 inches) thick, down from 6.9mm. That's equal to the Galaxy S25 edge, where the major selling point was its thinness. I shouldn’t have to say, but that thickness doubles when you fold it away – Samsung says it’s 13.7mm (0.54 inches) when closed. However you measure it, this is the thinnest Flip yet.\nGalaxy Z Flip 7 FE, Z Flip 7, Z Flip 6, side by side comparison.Image by Mat Smith for Engadget\nDespite less space, Samsung has increased the battery up to 4,300mAh, 300mAh more than the Z Flip 6.\nSamsung is addressing our issues with its recent Flip foldables. It’s also delivered solid battery life on nearly every device it has launched in the last year or so. The company also mentioned that the Flip 7 packs a new 3nm processor, the company’s own Exynos 2500 chip.\nThis is intriguing: last year’s foldables featured the powerful Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy that delivered impressive battery life. I’m interested in seeing whether Samsung’s latest silicon delivers similar performance and efficiency.\nWhile Samsung has equipped the Z Fold 7 with a new sensor, the Flip 7 essentially matches last year’s model, featuring a 50-megapixel primary camera with 2X optical zoom and a 12MP ultra-wide secondary camera. This year, the Flip 7 can record video in 10-bit HDR, up from 8-bit, resulting in richer colors for those seeking even more polished video from their smartphone.\nImage by Mat Smith for Engadget\nCamera controls have been refined to better suit the Flex Display on the front. There’s now a zoom slider for smoother video punch-ins and more broadly, an interface tidy-up. If you’re into using Samsung’s built-in photo filters, the Flip 7 will show live previews in each filter before you even choose one. Some of my favorite software features introduced on the Z Flip 6, auto-zoom and auto-frame, are back once again in the Flip 7. While the Flip is closed, the cameras can detect and track users, zooming in and out to focus on the subject automatically.\nSoftware-wise, Samsung is folding in the Gemini AI smarts and Now Brief features that debuted in the S25 series.  As a refresher, it’s Samsung’s rival take on the iPhone’s Dynamic Island. It’ll present health information, music and video controls and live updates from supported apps like Uber. It’s a perfect fit for the Flip, with its small glanceable screen. Similarly, you can now chat to Google’s Gemini Live AI assistant without unfurling the phone.\nAs I mentioned in my review of the Galaxy S25, the appeal of the Now Brief and Bar depends on how frequently you use it. Hopefully — and I’ve asked Samsung to confirm this — transferring data between Galaxy devices should include the profile and information used to populate these two features. With the Flip 7, you can tap into the Now Bar without opening the phone.\nThe Galaxy Z Flip 7 has a more typical 16:9 screen ratio.Image by Mat Smith for Engadget\nSamsung is also adding weekly updates to your Now Briefing, although it was hard to discern from the demo devices earlier this week whether that would be future-facing summaries of your schedule or more of a what-you-did-last-week summary of the week that’s already happened – it’s something we’ll be testing during review.\nThere isn’t much new functionality for the larger 4.1-inch secondary screen, which is a shame. In this regard, Motorola still manages to offer more with its flip phones.\nThe Flip 7 is also the first Flip device to support mouse and keyboard peripherals, which means, yes, Samsung Dex is back. It never left. And Samsung will continue to tell us all about it. If you want to plug your foldable into a giant monitor, you can now do that.\nThere’s also the Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE, priced at $900, with a 6.7-inch main display and a 3.4-inch Flex Window on the front. And if you think it looks and sounds familiar, you’re right. This is almost entirely the Galaxy Z Flip 6 with a new name. The only significant aesthetic change is that the Z Flip 7 FE lacks the metal accents on the cameras. The only meaningful spec change is an Exynos chip, replacing the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy.\nImage by Mat Smith for Engadget\nThe Z Flip 7 FE has a 50MP primary camera and 12MP ultra-wide, with a 10MP camera once it’s unfolded. The FE does a good job of showcasing how much thinner the Z Flip 7 is and how much better that full-width cover display looks, but those aren’t great selling points in and of themselves. The timing sucks, too: in Amazon’s Prime Day sale, the Z Flip 6 is $800. That’s $100 less than this \"new\" entry-level foldable, which is almost identical.\nThe Galaxy Z Flip 7 will launch at the same price as its predecessor, at $1,100. It’ll come in multiple colors: a very handsome dark blue, red and the usual monochrome black and white options. There will also be a mint color, available as an online exclusive. Preorders open today, with devices shipping on July 25.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-hands-on-bigger-screens-bigger-battery-better-foldable-140008222.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Samsung just unveiled the Galaxy Watch 8 at its Unpacked event today. This is a fairly major redesign with some nifty-looking features. It boasts a smaller profile, with the company claiming it's the slimmest smartwatch it has ever made. It's 8.6mm thick, which makes it around 11 percent slimmer than the Watch 7.\nIt ships with a new test that gauges the levels of antioxidants in the body. This is done by leveraging optical sensors. We gave this feature a try in a hands-on demo and came away fairly shocked, as it gave us a low antioxidant rating. It remains unclear if the data was correct, but it did motivate our tester to eat more vegetables. We'll need more time with an actual review unit to run the feature through its paces.\nThe Galaxy Watch 8 series includes some other new software tools that we didn't get to try. These give insights into vascular load, guidance when running and bedtime suggestions.\nIt's also the first Samsung smartwatch to ship with Wear OS 6 and this software impressed us. It changes up the UI, which our tester said \"made the screen feel roomier.\" The new operating system helps to improve the battery life and enhances the always-on display functionality. It also allows for full integration of Google's AI assistant, Gemini.\nMany visual elements have been refreshed, as part of the so-called \"cushion design\" that first arrived with last year's Watch Ultra. It looks like the round screen is encased in an aluminum squarish circle. We were kind of put off by this in pictures, but it looks better in person. These watches also include a new \"dynamic lug system\" that should make it easier to swap out different bands and minimize the gap between the device and a wrist.\nThe Watch 8 will be available in the standard configuration, but the company is also prepping a Watch 8 Classic. This one comes with the rotating bezel that has long-been popular with Samsung fans. Both versions feature brighter displays that get up to 3,000 nits. The standard Watch 8 series comes in 40mm and 44mm sizes, but the Classic is only available as a 46mm model.\nThe standard Watch 8 starts at $350 and the Classic starts at $500. Preorders are open right now, with general availability on July 25. The company also announced the new Galaxy Watch Ultra today, which features more storage and a new color option.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wearables/samsungs-slimmer-galaxy-watch-8-series-includes-gemini-access-140001865.html?src=rss",

    "full_text": "Samsung launched the Galaxy Watch8 smartwatch today at its Unpacked July 2025 event, along with the Galaxy Watch8 Classic version with a rotating bezel, which made a comeback after a year’s gap. The Galaxy Watch8 gets a screen upgrade with a brighter display that can have a peak brightness of 3,000 nits as compared to 2,000 nits on the Watch7. This allows you to use the smartwatch better in brighter conditions. The smartwatch comes with other features Samsung rolled out last month, including Bedtime Guidance, which gives you suggestions for the best time for you to sleep based on previous sleep-tracking data; Vascular Load, which measures stress on your vascular system while you are sleeping and gives you lifestyle tweak suggestions; a Running Coach, which lays out the optimum pace for your runs; and Antioxidant index, which measures carotenoids — a type of antioxidents found in vegetable or fruits. Most of these features assume a lot of factors about a user’s health and use calculations to provide a score and suggestions, which might not be very useful in real life. Both the watches run One UI 8 Watch based on Wear OS 6. With this software release, Google is making Gemini available on watches, so you can ask questions without typing. While Samsung is not making any changes to the Galaxy Watch Ultra, it is releasing a new Titanium Blue colorway at $650. The Galaxy Watch8 Classic is priced at $500 for the Bluetooth version and $550 for the LTE version, and it comes in a 46mm size. Save $450 on your TechCrunch All Stage pass Build smarter."

    "full_text": "is a reviewer with 10 years of experience writing about consumer tech. After years of incremental upgrades and barely warmed-over designs, Samsung’s foldables are finally taking a leap forward with some bold choices — just be prepared to pay up for them. But there was one notable casualty in the quest to make it thinner: S Pen support. The Fold’s new, wider format is a welcome change. Or $1,999, to be precise — that’s what the Z Fold 7 costs. But something about the words two thousand dollar smartphone just feels wrong, you know? Sure, it’s a little awkward working around them, but I’d rather deal with this and reap the benefits of a bigger screen than be hemmed in by the file folder shape. There are some meaningful upgrades, starting with a larger 4,300mAh battery. It has the same water and dust resistance (IP48) as last year. I just wish that “aha” moment came with a slightly lower price tag."

    "full_text": "Before coming to The Verge, she worked for Gizmodo and PC Magazine. Jeffrey Kim, Samsung’s senior product lead for smartwatches, told me there are a few reasons why Samsung went full squircle for this year’s lineup. My colleague Allison Johnson also gave me a gut check on the flatness, so you can’t accuse us both of having Stockholm syndrome. Samsung has refined it from last year, and the button mechanism is significantly easier to use (though I did lose a press-on nail in the process of trying it out). Specifically, you can ask it to do things that require multiple apps in a sequential order. Find the best-rated gyms in this area and send them to my spouse. When I tried crafting my own, things went a little sideways. This is the first time we’re really seeing a generative AI assistant on any smartwatch. As for the Antioxidant Index, I’m a bit more cautious. It’s not prescriptive, and my initial take is to view this with a grain of salt."

    "full_text": "Google is adding new AI features to Android’s Circle to Search and Gemini Live tools. The update was announced today, alongside the launch of the next-generation Galaxy foldables, and it includes new Gemini Live capabilities for Samsung devices and integrates Google’s search-centric AI Mode chatbot right into Circle to Search. AI Mode made its debut in Google Search earlier this year, allowing users to find information and web links via a Gemini-style chatbot instead of the traditional search engine experience. It isn’t widely available yet — it just launched outside the US to users in India — but Google said that it can now be accessed using the Circle to Search tool on Pixel and Samsung phones, allowing users to search the web for something on their screen without switching apps. When an AI response seems most helpful, an AI Overview will appear in your results,” Google said in a blog post. “From there, scroll to the bottom and tap ‘dive deeper with AI Mode’ to ask follow-up questions and explore more about your visual search.” Circle to Search can now also provide in-game help for mobile gamers, a feature that Google was testing back in January. Google said it’s also working on bringing AI Mode to Lens via the Google app for both Android and iOS devices. The new Galaxy Z Fold 7, Galaxy Z Flip 7, and Watch 8 series launched at Samsung’s Unpacked event today are the first devices to come with Android 16 and Wear OS 6 installed out of the box. Building on that relationship, Google has also announced a Gemini Live update for the Flip 7 that brings camera-sharing support to the external cover screen display, allowing the AI assistant to answer questions about what it can “see” without opening the phone."

    "summary": "So you need a new laptop — you’ve waited for the right time. Amazon Prime Day 2025, as has been in years past, offers a ton of laptop deals to consider. All kinds of devices are on sale this year, from refreshed MacBooks to high-end gaming machines to already affordable notebooks. But sussing out a good deal from a just-ok deal (or even worse, a bad deal all together), can be a challenge. Laptop prices on Amazon are all over the place even when it’s not Prime Day depending on the configuration of the notebook, the brand, the seller and a bunch of other factors.\nThis is where Engadget can help. We’ve poured over the Prime Day laptop deals available this year to pick out the best ones you can get across all kinds of computers. As always, if you’re super particular about the display panel you want in your next laptop, or you know you want to get as much RAM as possible, we recommend going straight to manufacturers to customize your next PC. But if you’re willing to work with premade models, Prime Day deals could help you save some cash on your next laptop. \nPrime Day laptop deals: MacBooks\nApple’s latest laptops are the MacBook Air M4 and the MacBook Pro M4, but the M3-powered machines are still available and great values when you can get them at steep discounts. But for the most future-proof options, we recommend going with the M4 MacBooks. Amazon actually has decent MacBook deals throughout the year, most of the time on the base configurations of any given model. In a welcomed update, Apple recently made all base models of the MacBook Air M4 have 16GB of RAM by default (which is the same as you’ll find on the base-level Pros).\n\n\n\nMacBook Air (15-inch, M4, 16GB RAM, 256GB SSD) for $1,049 ($150 off)\nMacBook Air (15-inch, M3, 24GB RAM, 512GB SSD) for $1,249 (26 percent off)\nMacBook Pro (14-inch, M4, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD) for $1,429 (11 percent off)\n\nPrime day laptop deals: Windows laptops\nYou’ve got a lot of variety to choose from when it comes to Windows laptops, and that can be a blessing or a curse. We recommend looking for a laptop from a reputable brand (i.e. Microsoft, Dell, Acer, Lenovo and others like them), and one that can handle daily work or play pressures. That means at least 8GB of RAM and 245GB of SSD storage, plus the latest Intel or AMD CPUs. If you’re looking for a new gaming laptop, you’ll need a bit more power and a dedicated graphics card to boot. Now is a good time to consider upgrading as well since Windows 10 will be sunset in October this year and Microsoft has recommended users upgrade to newer Windows 11 laptops.\n\n\n\nSamsung Galaxy Book5 360 (Windows 11, Copilot+, 15.6-inch, Intel Core Ultra 7, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD) for $1,050 (22 percent off)\nMicrosoft Surface laptop (Windows 11, Copilot+, 13.8-inch, Snapdragon X Plus) for $880 (27 percent off)\nLenovo V15 G2 laptop (Windows 11 Pro, 15.6-inch, Intel Celeron N4500, 32GB RAM, 1TB SSD) for $429 (28 percent off)\nMicrosoft Surface Pro 2-in-1 (Windows 11, Copilot+, 13-inch, Snapdragon X Plus, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD) for $870 (28 percent off)\nDell Inspiron 3520 laptop (Windows 11, 15.6-inch, Intel Core i5, 8GB RAM, 512GB SSD) for $350 (22 percent off)\nAcer Nitro V gaming laptop (Windows 11, 15.6-inch, Intel Core i5, RTX 4050, 8GB RAM, 512GB SSD) for $650 ($150 off)\nASUS ROG Strix G16 gaming laptop (Windows 11, Intel Core i9, RTX 4060, 16GB RAM, 1TB SSD) for $1,360 ($340 off)\n\nPrime Day laptop deals: Chromebooks\nMost Chromebooks start off pretty affordable, so that just means you can get them for even less during an event like Prime Day. If you’re a Chrome OS lover, it’s also a decent time to check out sales on premium Chromebooks, which can usually cost $500 or more. In general, we recommend looking for at least 4 to 8GB of RAM and at least 128GB of SDD storage in a Chromebook that you plan on using as your daily driver.\n\n\n\nHP Chromebook 14 (14-inch, Intel N100, 8GB RAM, 128GB UFS) for $200 (49 percent off)\nGoogle Pixelbook Go (13-inch, Intel Core M3, 8GB RAM, 64GB storage) for $319 (51 percent off)\nAcer Chromebook Plus 514 (14-inch, Intel Core i3, 8GB RAM, 128GB SSD) for $329 (18 percent off)\nHP Chromebook Plus x360 (14-inch, Intel Core i3, 8GB RAM, 128GB UFS) for $327 (45 percent off)\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-prime-day-laptop-deals-live-now-macbooks-windows-11-machines-chromebooks-and-others-130057906.html?src=rss",

Samsung's been teasing its upcoming foldables for the last several weeks. In early June, a Newsroom post pointed to the company bringing \"an Ultra-experience\" to \"a smaller and more portable form factor.\" It noted in a subsequent blog post, \"The camera will only get smarter -- helping users capture life's moments more vividly and make everyday experiences more seamless, personal and impactful.\" There are also murmurs of a more affordable Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE phone. This one isn't as mysterious, since Samsung basically previewed its Galaxy Watch 8 plans to CNET's Vanessa Hand Orellana when she talked to Dr. Hon Pak, the company's senior vice president and head of digital health, about new health features to expect. An animated invite for July's Unpacked event begins by showing the slim side profile of a device that then splits into two phones. One of these phones folds like a book, and on-screen text at the end reads \"Ultra Unfolds.\" If you're eager to get the upcoming Galaxy device, you can reserve it now and earn a $50 Samsung Credit at Samsung.com."

This remains one of the best discounts we've seen, and you have your choice of color options.\nThese headphones once topped our list of the best wireless headphones before being usurped by the XM6.

    "summary": "There is nothing more sublime than having a perfectly kitted out gaming station. That said, staying on top of things with the current pace of technology is always tricky. But for anyone hunting for upgrades, Amazon Prime Day is the perfect opportunity to improve your gaming setup on a discount. So regardless of whether you're looking for some cables, extra storage or a brand new monitor and headphones, we've gathered all the best gaming deals in one place for easy reading.\nBest Prime Day deals on video games\n\n\nStar Wars Outlaws - Limited Edition (Amazon Exclusive), PlayStation 5 for $29 ($31 off) \nAt full price, this game was easy to skip. But now that it's available for just $29 (half off its normal retail price), Star Wars Outlaws suddenly becomes a lot more interesting for fans of the franchise. You get to live out your dreams of being an intergalactic scoundrel while taking down bounties or battling secret crime syndicates. And because this is the limited edition, the game includes some pre-order rewards like the Kessel Run bonus pack and the Rogue Infiltrator bundle.\nAssassin’s Creed Shadows - Limited Edition for PS5/Xbox Series X for $48 ($22 off)\nIf you missed the latest entry in Ubisoft's most well-known franchise, this might be the time to jump in because for Prime Day, Assassin's Creed Shadows is available for $48, more than $20 off its regular retail price. This instalment has you explore feudal Japan as either the shinobi Naoe or the legendary samurai Yasuke while encountering some notable figures from the time period. If all you want is a wonderful world to sneak around in, it's hard to go wrong with Assassin's Creed on a discount.\nElden Ring: Shadow of The Erdtree Edition for PS5/Xbox Series X for $60 ($20 off)\nElden Ring is one of the most highly regarded games of this decade so far (and arguably of all time). For Prime Day, you can become a foul tarnished by picking up a version that includes the base game and the Shadow of the Erdtree expansion for $60. Elden Ring typically costs around $50 (though it's down to $30 on PS4, PS5 and Xbox Series X for Prime Day) and the DLC will usually run you another $40, so that's a decent discount compared with buying them separately — or even the Shadow of the Erdtree Edition at its regular price. \nFinal Fantasy I-VI Collection Anniversary Edition for PlayStation and Switch for $45 ($30 off, lowest ever price)\nThis collection of pixel remasters of the first six Final Fantasy games is an absolute steal at $45 during Prime Day. It's the lowest price we've seen to date for this set, which comes with a nice little sticker sheet of character sprites. Several other games in the series are on sale for PS5 as well, such as Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade ($30, $10 off), Final Fantasy VII Rebirth ($40, $30 off) and Final Fantasy XVI ($25, $15 off)\nBest Prime Day deals on VR headsets\nMeta Quest 3S 128GB Bundle for $249 ($51 off)\nThe Quest 3S is one of our picks for best VR headsets for good reason. Meta cut just the right corners from the more full-featured Quest 3, enabling it to drop the list price down lower. It has the same Snapdragon chip and controlers, but cheaps out a bit on the lenses, slightly lowering the graphics fidelity in use. Just like the Quest 3, it works standalone for lighter games and streaming, or in concert with a gaming PC for full-fat AAA VR titles. It's well worth the $300 Meta usually asks for it, so at $249 with two games included (Cardboard Hero and the excellent social VR hit Gorilla Tag), it's a steal.\nBest Prime Day deals on PCs and PC components\nASUS ROG Strix G16 Gaming Laptop with RTX 4060 for $1,360 ($340 off)\nWhile an RTX 4060 isn't the most powerful GPU on the market, getting a whole new laptop with solid specs for just $1,360 isn't something you can just ignore, especially if you're on a budget. This ROG Strix G16 comes with 16GB of RAM and 1TB of storage. And while its Intel Core i9-14900HX CPU is one generation old, it's still plenty fast enough for gaming, video editing or pretty much anything else you need to do. I also appreciate small features like a MUX switch that lets the laptop connect directly to the GPU for increased performance, though if you want, you can also enable automatic switching for better battery life. And with a 16-inch 240Hz QHD display with 100% DCI-P3 coverage, everything on screen is sure to look great.\nAcer Nitro V gaming laptop with NVIDIA RTX 4060 GPU for $1,200 ($150 off, lowest ever price)\nAcer's Nitro gaming laptops are meant to be more affordable alternatives to its flagship Predator systems. But now thanks to Prime Day, this model just got even more budget-friendly while still offering decent specs. You get an Intel Core i9-13900H CPU with 32GB of RAM, 1TB of storage and an RTX 4060 GPU, the latter of which should pair nicely with its 15.6-inch full HD 144Hz display. I also appreciate that unlike some gaming laptops, the Nitro V is stylish without being in your face with too many RGB lights, which makes it feel like an even better deal at $1,200. That's the lowest price we've seen to date for this configuration.\nCorsair Vengeance RGB DDR5 RAM 32GB (2x16GB) RAM for $95 ($25 off)\nAdding some extra memory to your desktop can help unlock its full potential. So for Prime Day, Corsair is offering two 16GB sticks of its Vengeance DDR5 RAM for just $95. Not only do you get built-in RGB lighting, Corsair's onboard voltage regulation makes it simpler to overclock your system. And for those who don't want to mess around in BIOS settings, you can control almost everything from the easy-to-use free iCue app.\nThermaltake GF1 (2024) Fully Modular ATX 850W Power Supply for $80 ($30 off, lowest ever price)\nEven though power supplies aren't the most exciting component you can put in your desktop, the importance of a good one can't be understated. For just $80, which is the lowest price we've seen to date for this product, the Thermaltake GF1 is fully modular (which means you can add or remove power cables as you need them) and has an ample max power of 850 watts along with an 80 Plus Gold rating for efficiency. And thanks to its 140mm fan, it should be pretty quiet, so it won't cause a ruckus if you decide to play some games at night.\nSamsung 990 EVO Plus 2TB PCIe M.2 SSD for $114 ($63 off)\nIf you're like me and are constantly running out of storage, this deal for one of Samsung's 990 EVO Plus 2TB M.2 SSDs is a fantastic way to add extra room on the cheap. With a 36 percent discount for Prime Day — down to $114 — this is the lowest price we've ever seen. And it's not like you're cutting corners on speed either, as the SSD supports both PCIe 4.0 x4 and PCIe 5.0 x2 and read/write rates of up to 7,250/6,300MB/s.\nAMD Ryzen 5 9600X 6-Core, 12-Thread Unlocked Processor for $165 ($110 off)\nThe Ryzen 5 9600X isn't super flashy, but it's a really solid budget CPU. And now, it’s even more affordable during Prime Day where it's going for just $165, which is $110 off its normal retail price. It features six cores and 12 total threads with a max boost speed of 5.4GHz and support for DDR5 RAM and PCIe Gen 5. It's also unlocked, so you have the freedom to overlock if you want. That said, you will need to buy a CPU cooler separately, as one doesn't come in the box.\nAMD Ryzen 9 9950X 16-Core, 32-Thread Unlocked Desktop Processor for $434 ($215 off)\nThe biggest issue with the Ryzen 9 9950X CPU was that at launch, it was a bit overpriced. But during Prime Day, that problem is being addressed thanks to a $215 discount that brings its cost down to under $500. The CPU features 16 cores and 32 threads along with 80MB of cache and support for DDR5 RAM and PCIe Gen 5. However, like some of AMD's other processors on sale this week, you will need to get a CPU cooler separately.\nBest Prime Day deals on gaming peripherals\nRazer Enki Gaming Chair for $450 ($50 off)\nIf you're going to be spending all day in front of a screen gaming, you better make sure whatever you're sitting on is super comfy. And as I've been using the Razer Enki every day for the last four years, I can attest that this chair is worth the money. It has a ton of adjustability for things like the arm rests, seat height and more. For more flexible folks, it was even designed so people can sit cross-legged. I also appreciate that in homes where neon green might not fit your vibe, there's an all-black model (plus a pink one too, though that one is currently sold out).\nElgato Stream Deck MK.2 for $110 ($40 off, lowest ever)\nIf you've ever dreamed about becoming a gaming streamer or simply want some extra customizable controls for your PC, Elgato's Stream Deck MK.2 could make a great addition to your setup. It has 15 programmable macro keys with built-in LCD displays so you can make custom buttons for switching scenes, turning on lights and so much more. Elgato also has plugins for services like YouTube, Twitch, Discord, so it'll play nicely with all the major streaming platforms. In short, it's like a command center for all your content creation and livestreaming needs.\nLogitech G305 Lightspeed Wireless Gaming Mouse for $29 ($21 off)\nThe Logitech G305 Lightspeed gaming mouse is just a simple PC peripheral done well. And at just $29, it's super affordable during Prime Day too. It features six programmable buttons, compatibility with both PCs and Macs and a sensor with sensitivity of up to 12,000 DPI. Meanwhile, thanks to a battery that lasts up to 250 hours between charges, you can go weeks between needing to plug it in. And because it's wireless, there won't be any cords or cables to get in your way.\nAmazon Luna Controller and one month of Luna+ for $40 ($30 off)\nThe Luna Controller by itself is down to $40, which matches a record-low price. However, if you're a newcomer to Luna+, you may as well pick up this bundle (which is also matching a record low) for the same price, as it includes one month of access to the service for new subscribers. This gamepad is a solid option for those who want to check out Luna, Amazon's cloud gaming service. Prime subscribers get access to a dedicated channel with a rotating selection of games at no extra cost. This month, for instance, you can check out Death Stranding Director's Cut, Hollow Knight and EA Sports FC 25. \n8BitDo Retro Mechanical Keyboard for $80 ($20 off)\nWith its Retro Mechanical Keyboard, 8BitDo strikes a great balance between a nostalgic design and support for more modern features like wireless connectivity (both BT and 2.4GHz). There are several different versions to choose from, though the one inspired by the classic NES is the model I'd choose. The keyboard features an 87-key layout with PBT keycaps and Kailh Box switches, though because the PCB is hot swappable, you can always change them out for something else.\nSony Inzone H9 Wireless Gaming Headset for $198 ($102 off)\nFor anyone looking for a new pair of over-the-ear wireless gaming headphones to pair with a PS5, it's hard to do better than Sony's Inzone H9 headset. Not only does it have a similar design to the console, they are the only other headphones besides the official Pulse cans that support on-screen status notifications for volume, mic mute, game/chat balance and more. They also share a lot of the underlying tech used in Sony's iconic WH-1000XM line, so you'll get fantastic audio quality and active noise cancellation. But the best part is that at $198, you're looking at a serious discount of 34 percent, which is more than $100 off its regular retail price.\nSeagate Storage Expansion Card 2TB Solid State Drive for $209 ($21 off)\nGames are getting bigger every day, so if you need some extra storage for your Xbox Series S or X, you'd be silly not to pick up one of Seagate's 2TB Expansion Cards for just $209. That's enough room for a dozen or more digital titles (or like three versions of Call of Duty) and it's the biggest SSD storage module that slots into the back of the console without the need for a separate box.\nAmazon Basics UPS Battery Backup & Surge Protector 800VA/450W for $65 ($10 off)\nI'm not here to nag, but if you have a desktop PC, you really ought to consider adding a UPS (uninterruptible power supply) to your setup as they prevent power surges or momentary outages from knocking your system offline. Plus, this one has a beefy 450-watt battery backup and 12 outlets so you can connect all of your other PC gadgets to it. So if you're going to do the smart thing by adding some extra electrical protection to your home during Prime Day, you might as well save some money in the process.\nBest Prime Day deals on mobile gaming gear\nSamsung Galaxy S25 Ultra (512GB) for $1,055 ($365 off)\nWith Samsung's next Unpacked event expected to show off new foldables, it looks like some of the existing models are getting some serious discounts for Prime Day, including the Galaxy S25 Ultra. And at $1,055, this is the lowest price we've seen for Samsung's current flagship phone yet. For gamers, thanks to its Snapdragon 8 Elite chip, the S25 Ultra offers some of the best performance you can get in a phone right now, while its built-in vapor chamber should help prevent throttling. Its 6.9-inch AMOLED display is also one of the best mobile screens on the market today.\nRazer Kishi Ultra for $100 ($50 off)\nRazer doesn't normally run a ton of deals for Prime Day, but it seems this year the company is making an exception as there are discounts on everything from gamepads to headsets and more. That said, one of the standout deals is for the Kishi Ultra gaming controller. On top of just being a well-built gamepad add-on for phones and tablets, its larger dimension and USB-C port means it works with a huge range of devices — both Android and iOS. This even includes more niche devices like foldables like the Galaxy Z Fold series, which often don't fit inside other mobile gamepads due to their unique design.\nBest Prime Day deals on gaming monitors and TVs\nSony 85-Inch Class 4K Ultra HD Bravia 3 LED TV for $1,098 ($500 off)\nThere's no better way to upgrade your living room gaming setup than with a brand-new, big-ass TV. Granted, the Bravia 3 is one of Sony's entry-level models (fancier sets get higher numbers), but with a discounted price of $1,098 for a massive 85-inch panel, this deal represents one of the biggest screens you can get for the money. It also has Google TV built in, so you'll get a very simple and straightforward way to stream your favorite shows and movies from services like Netflix, HBO and more. But perhaps most importantly is that for PS5 owners, the Bravia 3 supports exclusive features when connected to a PS5, such as Auto HDR Tone Mapping and Auto Genre Picture mode.\nAlienware AW2725DF 26.7-inch OLED gaming monitor for $600 ($300 off)\nFor anyone who has been waiting for prices of OLED gaming monitors to drop, this may be your chance to pounce on a great deal. That's because at $600, Alienware's 26.7-inch OLED display strikes a good balance between price and performance with a 360Hz refresh rate, 2560 x 1440 resolution and support for AMD FreeSync Premium Pro. And of course, you get those lovely pure blacks and vivid colors that OLED panels have become known for.\nSamsung Odyssey Neo G9 Series 57-inch 4K 240Hz 4K gaming monitor for $1,600 ($700 off)\nThis 57-inch monitor isn't for people with limited space. But if you've got the room, at $1,600, this is the lowest we've ever seen the Neo G9 as this deal represents a whopping $700 savings compared to its regular list price. This thing features a solid 240Hz refresh rate along with support for AMD FreeSync Premium Pro, a 1000R curve and Quantum mini LED tech with 2,392 local dimming zones. For people who love ultra-wide displays, this should be at the top of your upgrade list during Amazon Prime Day.\nAcer Nitro 27-inch WQHD IPS gaming monitor for $170 ($120 off)\nAnyone looking for a solid and affordable 1440p gaming monitor during Prime Day should really check out this 27-inch IPS display from Acer. For just $170 (matching a record-low price), it features a relatively speedy 180Hz refresh rate along with support for AMD FreeSync Premium and a good color range that covers 95 percent of DCI-P3. The height-adjustable stand can also swivel and pivot, while thin bezels on top and on the sides will make sure it won't look dated in a few years. So while this thing isn't super fancy, it's simple and competent in the best ways.\nBest Prime Day deals on batteries and power packs\nUGREEN Magnetic Power Bank 10,000mAh fast charging battery pack for $30 ($3 off)\nThe Switch 2 is a fantastic handheld, but its longevity could be better. So if you're planning to take it on a long trip, pick up UGREEN's 10,000mAH fast charging battery pack to help keep running when you're away from a plug. This power pack almost has enough juice to fully refill a Switch 2 twice, which can add between five and 12 hours of additional game time (depending on the title). It also has an output of 20 watts, which is as much as the Switch 2 can suck down at once, but it's still super pocketable measuring just four inches long and 0.7 inches thick. And if you need a convenient way to recharge your phone, the battery pack also comes with Qi wireless support.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-prime-day-gaming-deals-from-laptops-and-peripherals-to-the-latest-video-games-085719478.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Samsung has announced that its next Galaxy Unpacked event will be taking place on July 9 at 10AM ET. This is the third major Unpacked event of the year, following launches of the Galaxy S25 series in January and, more recently, a virtual unveiling of the Galaxy S25 Edge. This time, if previous years are any indication, the company should be showing off new foldables and wearables.\nA lot of it may be business as usual, but the company has hinted that some possibly exciting new additions are in the works. We're liveblogging the event, which is taking place within the hour, so join us over there for our live coverage of Unpacked 2025. We're also likely to have hands-on impressions of all the new devices Samsung announces so make sure to come back for our first-hand thoughts.\nGalaxy Z Fold 7, Galaxy Z Flip 7 and Galaxy Z Fold Ultra\nSamsung Galaxy Z Fold 6Sam Rutherford for Engadget\nBased on the usual annual cadence, this summer Unpacked 2025 will most likely introduce the Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Galaxy Z Flip 7. One recent leak claimed that Gemini Live will be a core part of the foldables' presentation, and considering AI is the buzzword for every tech presentation these days, it would be strange if Unpacked didn't follow suit. AI features got a positive reception from both our Fold 6 and Flip 6 reviewers, although they fell more under the umbrella of parlor tricks than valuable assets.\nAndroid Headlines is back with renders of what it claims show the design of the Galaxy Z Fold 7. The foldable sports a slimmer profile than the prior model and the navy blue chassis is certainly pretty. It also indicates that both the cover display and inner display are reportedly bigger in this design, up to 6.5 inches and 8.2 inches, respectively. The publication also showed purported images of the Galaxy Z Flip 7 that also pointed to increased screen real estate.\nThere may be a third player in the foldables lineup for this Unpacked. A teaser from Samsung last month pointed toward a Galaxy Z Fold Ultra that will come with Galaxy AI. There are no specs in the blog post, but the company insists that this will have \"industry-leading hardware, cutting-edge performance and seamless AI integration optimized for the foldable format.\" This doesn't appear to be the tri-fold design we've heard rumblings about, but that would be a fun reveal if Samsung does pull that off as a surprise announcement.\nGalaxy Watch 8\nSamsung Galaxy Watch 7Amy Skorheim for Engadget\nOn the wearables front, the only thing we're really anticipating is news about the Galaxy Watch 8. But the anticipation is pretty mild.\nThis smartwatch collection from Samsung hasn't really pushed the envelope for several years; the Galaxy Watch 7 was the third iteration where our reviewers felt the new model offered only incremental improvements over the previous generation. So either this Unpacked will be yet another round of small gains on the specs or Samsung will surprise us with some substantial upgrades. Improved battery life would be a big plus.\nGalaxy S25 FE\nFor the past few weeks, Samsung fans have been speculating that a new smartphone announcement could be on the way soon. Although the company's standard mobile hardware is usually unveiled at the start of the year, we've seen some credible rumors that a new Galaxy S25 FE is in the works. If Samsung is looking to release a new version to that line in the fall, it would make sense to announce and open pre-orders at the summer Unpacked.\nThe Galaxy S24 FE had some solid specs but was a little pricey to be a true budget model, especially with an underwhelming set of AI features. So far, the leaks about the S25 FE also point toward continued underwhelm, with claims that its cameras won't be seeing much in the way of upgrades, although it may be getting a boost to performance and battery if rumors that it will use the Exynos 2400 processor turn out to be true.\nUpdate, July 3 2025, 8:00AM ET: This story has been updated to include confirmed dates for the Unpacked event.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-preview-massive-leaks-suggest-we-can-expect-z-fold-7-z-flip-7-and-more-150001209.html?src=rss",
    "full_text": "Samsung has announced that its next Galaxy Unpacked event will be taking place on July 9 at 10AM ET. Based on the usual annual cadence, this summer Unpacked 2025 will most likely introduce the Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Galaxy Z Flip 7. One recent leak claimed that Gemini Live will be a core part of the foldables' presentation, and considering AI is the buzzword for every tech presentation these days, it would be strange if Unpacked didn't follow suit. AI features got a positive reception from both our Fold 6 and Flip 6 reviewers, although they fell more under the umbrella of parlor tricks than valuable assets. It also indicates that both the cover display and inner display are reportedly bigger in this design, up to 6.5 inches and 8.2 inches, respectively. There may be a third player in the foldables lineup for this Unpacked. This doesn't appear to be the tri-fold design we've heard rumblings about, but that would be a fun reveal if Samsung does pull that off as a surprise announcement. The Galaxy S24 FE had some solid specs but was a little pricey to be a true budget model, especially with an underwhelming set of AI features. Samsung is hosting its latest Unpacked event today, July 9. Follow our ongoing Galaxy Unpacked liveblog before and during the presentation, which kicks off at 10AM ET."

    "full_text": "is a senior policy reporter at The Verge, covering the intersection of Silicon Valley and Capitol Hill. A federal appeals court just threw out a new government regulation that would have required subscription services to give consumers an easy way to cancel. The Federal Trade Commission’s click-to-cancel rule was set to take effect next week, and would have required everything from your gym membership to Amazon Prime subscription to let customers cancel their recurring payments as easily as they signed up, and through the same method. Last fall, industry groups representing companies that benefit from subscription revenue — including cable providers, entertainment studios, advertising companies, and home security firms — sought to block the rule in court, arguing the FTC aimed to “regulate consumer contracts for all companies in all industries and across all sectors of the economy.” But in a unanimous ruling by a three-judge panel for the Eighth Circuit, the court found that the FTC under former Democratic Chair Lina Khan erred so gravely in its roll-out of the rule that it needs to be thrown out altogether. “While we certainly do not endorse the use of unfair and deceptive practices in negative option marketing, the procedural deficiencies of the Commission’s rulemaking process are fatal here,” the court wrote. The Eighth Circuit found that the agency skipped steps to issue the rule, including depriving stakeholders of “a notable opportunity to dissuade the FTC from adopting the Rule as proposed.” Even though the court said the FTC’s decision to skip some analysis “was certainly not made in bad faith,” it found that the petitioners “have raised ‘enough uncertainty whether [their] comments would have had some effect if they had been considered,’ especially in the context of a closely divided Commission vote that elicited a lengthy dissenting statement.” The court referenced those dissents by now-Chair Andrew Ferguson and Commissioner Melissa Holyoak, both Republicans, in its opinion. FTC spokesperson Juliana Gruenwald Henderson declined to comment on the ruling. Disclosure: Comcast — represented by NCTA - The Internet and Television Association, one of the parties to the case — is an investor in Vox Media, The Verge’s parent company."

    "summary": "Amazon's Prime Day is always a key period for camera buyers as any discount on such a major purchase is always helpful. Despite the tariffs, this year's sale is particularly strong for photography buffs, with big discounts on most of the major brands including some that don't normally offer deals. \nSome key deals include discounts on DJI drones, along with sales on models from Sony, Canon, GoPro and Nikon. Many of those cameras are ranked highly in our most recent camera guide, like Nikon's Z6 III, Canon EOS R5 Mark III and the GoPro Hero 13 Black — so feel free to check that out as you add items to your cart. Without further delay, here are the best Prime Day camera deals we could find.  \nBest Prime Day camera deals\n\n\nCanon EOS R100 with RT-S18-45mm lens for $549 (15 percent off): Canon's EOS R100 is the only modern mirrorless camera you can get with a kit lens for under $600. It comes with a 24-megapixel APS-C sensor that delivers great picture quality with Canon's pleasing skin tones.\nCanon EOS R50 with RF-S18-45mm lens for $749 (15 percent off): Canon's 24-megapixel APS-C EOS R50 is great for travel, parties, street photography and more thanks to the portable size and built-in flash. It offers nice image quality with warm, human friendly photos and is capable for creators as well with 4K 30fps supersampled video, with 10-bit and HDR capability.\nOM System OM-5 for $899 (25 percent off): For creators on a budget, the 20-megapixel, Micro Four Thirds OM-5 from OM System (formerly Olympic) is a great option at this price. It lets you shoot 4K video and 20MP stills at up to 10 fps. The design is nice with a full complement of manual controls, a fully articulating display and 7.5 stops of built-in stabilization.\nPanasonic Lumix S9 for $1,298 (13 percent off): The S9 may be Panasonic's smallest full-frame camera but it comes with the same 24MP sensor and similar video features to the popular S5 II. To that end, it offers up to 6.2K video, in-body stabilization and reliable autofocus. The key feature though is a special LUT button that lets you easily choose a custom cinematic look designed by professional creators.\nCanon EOS R6 Mark II for $1,899 (5 percent off): Canon's R6 Mark II offers a great mix of video and photography features. You can now shoot RAW stills at up to 40 fps and video specs are equally solid with sharp full-sensor 4K at up to 60 fps. It comes with in-body stabilization that's great for video and photos and autofocus is quicker and more versatile than ever.\nNikon Z6 III for $2,197 (12 percent off): Nikon's Z6 III is the best hybrid mirrorless camera for the money, thanks to the incredible performance of the 24-megapixel partially stacked sensor. You can shoot RAW bursts at up to 20 fps in electronic shutter mode while nailing sharp shots thanks to the much-improved autofocus. On the video side, it supports 6K RAW at up to 60 fps, or 4K 120p. All of that makes it ideal for creators and photographers alike, with the only drawback being the reduced resolution. \nSony A7 IV for $2,198 (19 percent off): It beats many rivals with 33 megapixels of resolution rather than 24, with image quality much improved overall. Video is now up to par with rivals with 4K at up to 60p with 10 bit 4:2:2 quality. Autofocus is incredible for both video and stills, and the in-body stabilization does a good job. The biggest drawback is rolling shutter that limits the use of the electronic shutter.\nCanon EOS R5 Mark II for $3,999 ($300 off): It's company’s best camera in years thanks to improvements in areas like autofocus and video. It comes with a high-resolution 45-megapixel stacked sensor, but still lets you shoot blackout-free bursts at up to 30 fps — and most of the shots will be sharp thanks to the updated autofocus with AI tracking. Video is also strong with up to 8K 60p RAW and 4K 120 fps shooting. \nBest Prime Day action cam and drone deals\n\n\nDJI Neo drone for $159 (20 percent off): The DJI Neo may be an inexpensive, beginner-friendly drone, but has powerful features like subject tracking and quick shots. It can shoot video at up to 4K 30 fps and is quick and maneuverable, though it's also fairly loud. You can also grab one with three batteries and a charger for $229 (21 percent off).\nDJI Osmo Mobile 7P gimbal for $125 (15 percent off): This three-axis gimbal keeps your smartphone video as smooth as can be with DJI's ActiveTrack 7.0, and includes a magnetic snapping mechanism so you can install your mobile device in seconds. The latest feature is native tracking that follows you around, thanks to the included Multifunctional Module. \nDJI Osmo Action 4 for $209 (30 percent off): DJI's Osmo Action 4 is a tremendous deal at this price, as you're not giving up much in comparison to the most recent model, the Action 5. It has the same big 1/1.3-inch sensor that delivers excellent video quality, especially in low light. It also features a D-LogM profile to boost dynamic range, DJI's excellent clip-on mount and high-quality 4K 120p video.\nDJI Mini 4K drone for $239 (20 percent off): The Mini 4 weighs less than 249 grams so it doesn't require a permit, but can still shoot 4K video at up to 30 fps or 2.7K at 60 fps with three-axis stabilization. It can fly up to 31 minutes on a charge and has one-tap movements like dronie, helix and panoramic shooting. If you have a bit of extra money in your budget, the bundle with an extra battery and carrying case is also on sale for $309 (21 percent off) or with a charger and three batteries for $359. \nGoPro Hero 13 Black for $329 (23 percent off): GoPro’s Hero 13 Black is now available with a new family of modular lenses called the HB series (ultra-wide, anamorphic and macro), making it far more versatile for action creators. It also has a slightly bigger battery that allows longer capture times, up to 90 minutes for 4K 30fps video. Other specs remain the same, including up to 5.3K at 60fps in 10-bit color, along with the excellent Hypersmooth stabilization. \nInsta360 X4 for $349 (30 percent): Insta360 simply dominates the 360-degree category, thanks to its ability to capture action at up to 8K 30fps or 5.7K at 60fps — providing more detail when you reframe it to 16:9. At the same time, the Me Mode that produces flat video (with automatic selfie stick removal) has been upgraded from a maximum 2.7K 30fps to 4K 30fps. It also offers solid battery life, waterproofing to 10m and a free editing app. \nBest Prime Day deals on camera accessories\n\n\nK&F Concept 25L backpack for $50 (17 percent off): A large 25L three-tiered camera bag that can hold multiple cameras, lenses and drones. It has quick side access and features durable materials with a rain cover, making it great for outdoor travel, weddings or vlogging.\nLexar 256GB Professional Silver Pro V60 memory card for $51 (32 percent off): An excellent compromise between speed and value with up to 280MB/s read and 160MB/s write speeds. \nSmallRig 71-inch Camera Tripod with 360 ball head for $56 (20 percent off): Two-in-one tripod monopod with a head that adjusts 360 degrees so you can take photos at any angle horizontally or vertically. \nElgato Key Light 2800 lumens for $140 (22 percent off): For presentations or simple studio shoots, you get a silent, low-heat studio light with high output and a 2900-7000K temperature range. It's controllable by WiFi and has an opal glass face for glare-free diffusion. \nElgato Prompter for $190 (37 percent off): Whether you're a creator on YouTube or present on Zoom, the Elgato Prompter is an elegant and popular choice thanks to the built-in display that allows you to read scripts while looking at the camera. Support more cameras than ever, even with wide lenses and features an easy setup. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cameras/the-best-amazon-prime-day-camera-deals-you-can-get-right-now-for-2025-104502187.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Sure, TV prices have fallen a ton recently, but Amazon’s Prime Day proves they can get even cheaper. (And honestly, it’s just nice not having to wait until Black Friday.) So it’s high time to consider an upgrade, especially if you’re rocking an older 1080p or first-gen 4K set. Newer TVs not only offer better brightness, contrast and HDR capabilities, but you can likely find a much larger set than you currently own for far less than you think. (You’d be surprised how much 75-inch, 85-inch and even 98-inch sets have fallen.) Here’s our collection of choice TV offerings from Sony, Samsung and LG, as well as streaming devices and soundbars to consider.\nBest OLED TV deals\n\n\n\n\nLG OLED Evo C5 (65-inch) for $1,677 (down from $2,700): LG has steadily improved its C-series over the years, and the C5 Evo is its best model yet. In addition to the usual benefits of OLED, it also sports a brightness booster that can help it work well in bright rooms, as well as LG’s own “Perfect Color” technology. It doesn’t have quantum dots like Sony and Samsung’s OLEDs, but it’s also coming in significantly less than those models. The C5 Evo also has a fast 144Hz refresh rate for gaming, as well as support for NVIDIA’s G-SYNC and AMD FreeSync variable refresh rate technology. (If you’re looking for something larger, the 77-inch model has also been discounted to $2,800.)\nSony Bravia 8 II (65”) QD OLED for $2,998 (down from $3,500): Sony’s top of the line set has everything you’d want in a high-end TV, like quantum dots for improved color and brightness, as well as the inky dark blacks and infinite contrast of a modern OLED panel. You’ll always pay a bit of a premium for Sony TVs, but partially that’s due to their world-class image processing – in this case, that’s handled by Sony’s XR chip. (You can also snag the 55-inch model for $2,500.)\n\nBest Mini LED TV deals\n\n\n\nTCL QM8K (65-inch) QD Mini LED for $1,500 (down from $2,500): TCL's QM8 sets feature the company's best and brightest Mini LED screens with Quantum Dots. It has an ultra-thin bezel, 144Hz refresh rate for fast gaming and one of the best contrast ratios you'll see outside of an OLED screen. Basically, it's one of the best screens you'll find that's not an OLED. While we think the 65-inch model is a great deal for most rooms, you can also step up to the 75-inch for $2,000, the 85-inch for $2,500 and the massive 98-inch set for $3,000. \nTCL QM6K (98-inch) QD Mini LED for $1,800 (down from $3,000 MSRP): The QM6K is one of the best deals we’ve seen on a 98-inch TV under $2,000, and it’s not a low-quality LCD either. It has a bright Mini LED screen with quantum dots for enhanced color, and it sports a fast 144Hz refresh rate for gaming. It’s also a pretty solid Prime Day deal, coming in much lower than the previous $2,200 low price. (If you don’t have the wall space for a nearly 100-inch set, the 65-inch model is similarly great and is down to $550, nearly half off its $1,000 MSRP and $100 off its lowest price. The 75-inch model is also a great deal at $850.)\nSony Bravia 5 (85-inch) Mini LED for $2,298 (down from $2,800): The Bravia 5 pairs a super bright Mini LED panel with Sony’s XR image processing chip. It won’t reach the deep dark black levels of OLED, but Mini LED achieves something close, and it can also get much brighter than OLED panels. That makes this model, as well as any Mini LED TV, an excellent option for bright rooms. (You can also scale down to the 65-inch and 75-inch Bravia 5 for $1,300 and $1,800, respectively. And there’s also the truly massive 98-inch model, which is now $1,000 off at $5,000.)\nHisense U7 (75-inch) Mini LED for $750 (down from $900): The Hisense U7 is a great bargain when it comes to Mini LED sets. It offers Quantum Dots, full array local dimming for better contrast and a fast 144Hz gaming mode. It's one of the best options around if you're looking for a large TV that's bigger than 65 inches under $1,000.  \n\nBest Frame-style TV deals\n\nSamsung The Frame Pro (65-inch) for $1,899 (down from $2,200): New for 2025, Samsung's Frame Pro sets offer brighter and higher-quality Mini LED panels for a superior TV watching experience. The 65-inch Frame Pro is a great option for most living rooms since it's large enough to deliver an immersive viewing experience, and it also comes with Samsung's wireless One Connect box for less cable clutter. While there's still no OLED Frame TV yet, this Mini LED set is the closest you'll get today. (If you're looking for something larger, the 75-inch Frame Pro is down to $2,699, and the 85-inch is $3,799.) \nHisense S7N CanvasTV (65-inch) for $898 (down from $1,300): Hisense's spin on Samsung's Frame sets, the CanvasTV, comes in much cheaper and with a boatload of features. The S7N sports an anti-glare display and art mode, as you'd expect, but there's also 144Hz support for a bit of gaming. It also comes with a slim wall mount so you can hang it on your wall like a genuine work of art. (The 55-inch model is also a great deal at $689, and the 77-inch is down to $1,399.)   \n\nBest budget TV deals\n\nAmazon Fire TV (50-inch) for $260 (down from $400): Amazon’s budget Fire TV sets handle the basics just fine, and at this price the 50-inch model is a compelling deal as a second or third TV set. It supports HDR10 (but not Dolby Vision), and as you’d expect, it also has the Amazon Fire TV OS built-in, giving you access to over 23,000 apps. It also sports Amazon’s Alexa Voice Remote to help you find content quickly. (You can also go up and down in size, depending on your needs. The 43-inch model is now down to $220, and it’d be a solid choice for a small bedroom or office.)\nHisense QD6 (55-inch) for $240 (down from $380): Hisense is on a roll delivering tons of TV features at a very low cost, and the QD6 line is a prime example of that. It has Amazon's Fire TV and Alexa support built in, and it also supports Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos. It can even handle a bit of fast gaming with a 120Hz refresh rate.\nTCL QM6K (55-inch) for $448 (down from $600): TCL's mid-range sets finally fall below $500 for Primew Day, and that makes it one of the higher quality options in this price range. The QM6K features a bright Mini LED panel, a 144Hz refresh rate for gaming and it even includes an Onkyo speaker setup built-in.\nRoku Smart TV (32-inch) for $100 (down from $143): Not every room needs a large TV — this Roku Smart TV is perfect for a small bedroom or office. It's powered by Roku's OS and it comes with a Voice Remote. While it only offers a 720p resolution, that will still look decently sharp on a screen this small.\n\nBest soundbar and speaker deals\n\n\n\nSonos Beam Gen 2 for $369 (down from $499): Sonos's latest Beam is one of the best mid-range soundbars on the market. It's compact, but it also delivers expansive sound. And it also supports Dolby Atmos through a bit of speaker virtualization. The Beam is also ideal if you've already got Sonos speakers, since you can pair them all together for some household jams (or just bring your TV audio to different rooms).\nTCL S55H soundbar for $100 (down from $160): At this price, the TCL S55H delivers a ton of audio bang for the buck. It comes with a wireless subwoofer, features auto room calibration and supports virtualized surround sound like Dolby Atmos and DTS Virtual:X. With 220W of power behind its sound, the S55H should be powerful enough to fill most rooms.\nSony Bravia Theater Quad for $2,000 (down from $2,500): Leave it up to Sony to do something different in the world of home entertainment. The Bravia Theater Quad are a set of four flat modules, containing a total of sixteen speakers, which deliver truly enveloping surround sound. They’re the ideal solution for anyone who wants a theatrical experience, but doesn’t want to see gigantic tower or bookshelf speakers in their space. They support Sony’s 360 Spatial Sound Mapping, as well as Dolby Atmos and DTS:X.\nSony Bravia Theater Bar 9 for $998 (down from $1,400): The Bravia Theater Bar 9 is Sony’s most capable self-contained soundbar, with 13 speakers and support for virtualized surround sound with Dolby Atmos, DTS:X and Sony’s own 360 Spatial Sound Mapping technology. It’s the best option if you want to enjoy your favorite movies and music loud, but also don’t want to see speakers all over your living room. (The Bravia Theater 8 is also discounted to $698 and very well-equipped, with 11 speakers and the same surround sound support. )\nSony Bravia Theater System 6 for $568 (down from $770): If you want real surround sound from an actual subwoofer and satellite speakers spread around your room, the Bravia Theater System 6 is a solid choice. It pairs together a compact soundbar, wireless subwoofer and two rear satellites (connected by a wireless amplifier).. It’s a great option for apartments and small living rooms where you just can’t live with virtualized surround sound. (You can also snag the soundbar on its own for $448, down from $650.)\n\nBest streaming deals\n\n\n\n\nRoku Ultra for $69 (down from $100): Roku's ultimate set-top box is the best streamer for home theater enthusiasts who want to avoid the more expensive Apple TV. It handles every video and audio format you'd want — including Dolby Vision, Atmos and HDR 10+ — and it also comes with Roku's rechargeable Voice Remote Pro. The Roku Ultra is the fastest device from the company, so you can expect to zip around Roku's interface and apps far quicker than the cheaper streaming sticks.\nRoku Streaming Stick+ for $30 (down from $40): The Roku Streaming Stick+ is the easiest way to bring Roku's robust app selection to any 4K TV. It's a great option for first-generation 4K sets that either had no streaming apps, or are way too slow by now. And it's a great gadgets to bring on trips to maintain access to all of your favorite streaming services.  \nRoku Streaming Stick HD For $20 (down from $30): The basic HD Roku Streaming stick is a solid option for bringing streaming apps to older TVs, which likely don't support 4K or any fancy HDR standards. Sure, it's as no frills as you can get, but for $20 it's worth having a backup streaming device. (or one you won't mind losing during a trip). And if you have an older TV that's still working, it's definitely worth investing a bit to get modern apps.\nAmazon Fire TV Stick 4K for $25 (down from $50): Amazon’s Fire TV Stick 4K is a simple way to add some streaming smarts to any TV with an HDMI port. Alternatively, you can load it up with your favorite streaming apps and bring it on the road – it sure beats fighting with apps built into hotel or AirBnb TVs. As a bonus, you can also play Xbox cloud streaming games when you pair a controller (Xbox GamePass membership required).     \nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/best-prime-day-tv-deals-2025-from-sony-lg-samsung-and-others-084705164.html?src=rss",
    "full_text": "(And honestly, it’s just nice not having to wait until Black Friday.) (You’d be surprised how much 75-inch, 85-inch and even 98-inch sets have fallen.) Sony Bravia 8 II (65”) QD OLED for $2,998 (down from $3,500): Sony’s top of the line set has everything you’d want in a high-end TV, like quantum dots for improved color and brightness, as well as the inky dark blacks and infinite contrast of a modern OLED panel. (If you’re looking for something larger, the 77-inch model has also been discounted to $2,800.) It offers Quantum Dots, full array local dimming for better contrast and a fast 144Hz gaming mode. It’s also a pretty solid Prime Day deal, coming in much lower than the previous $2,200 low price. Hisense S7N CanvasTV (65-inch) for $898 (down from $1,300) : Hisense's spin on Samsung's Frame sets, the CanvasTV, comes in much cheaper and with a boatload of features. The 65-inch Frame Pro is a great option for most living rooms since it's large enough to deliver an immersive viewing experience, and it also comes with Samsung's wireless One Connect box for less cable clutter. While there's still no OLED Frame TV yet, this Mini LED set is the closest you'll get today. With 220W of power behind its sound, the S55H should be powerful enough to fill most rooms."

    "summary": "If you’ve been holding out on a new set of earbuds or headphones during Prime Day, now’s a great time to take a look at the deals. While Sony and Bose are typically among our favorites each year, there are a number of options available at discounted prices right now. Whether you prefer over-ear headphones or true wireless earbuds, the list of deals accounts for both styles and includes a range of prices. Plus, we’ll guide you through the fray with the best features of each model so you’re not left sorting out the spec sheet by yourself.\nPrime Day Sony deals\n\n\nSony WH-1000XM6 headphones for $430 ($20 off): Sony's latest flagship headphones have only been out a few months and we're already seeing a small discount on them. These are my top pick in our headphones guide for the combination of advanced features, comfy fit, great sound and improved active noise cancellation (ANC).  \nSony ULT Wear headphones for $130 ($70 off): If you're after a solid set of Sony cans but don't want to splurge for the 1000X line, the ULT Wear is a good option. There are a bunch of handy features and robust sound with ULT bass boost.\nSony WH-CH720N headphones for $80 ($70 off): The cheapest Sony headphones we'd recommend for Prime Day are no slouch. They're lightweight and comfy with respectable sound for the price. You also get Adaptive Sound Control, 360 Reality Audio and multipoint Bluetooth on this budget model. \nSony WF-1000XM5 earbuds for $200 ($100 off): My top pick for best earbuds is also on sale for Prime Day. No other company comes close to the list of features Sony offers here, and that's on top of excellent sound, improved fit and effective ANC. \nSony LinkBud Fit earbuds for $130 ($70 off): Sony's much smaller earbuds offer big sound and a lot of features for less than the 1000X model. These are a big improvement over the company's LinkBuds S, which were already a low-key hit for affordable earbuds.\nSony WF-CH710N earbuds for $80 ($40 off): The CH710N is still quite new, but the earbuds are a steal at $80 for Prime Day. The compact, comfy design is a highlight, as are all the features Sony managed to pack in. Plus, they're available in a lovely transparent blue that allows you to see all of the internal components. \nSonos Prime Day deals\n\n\nPrime Day Bose deals (also available at Bose.com)\n\n\nBose QuietComfort Earbuds for $129 (28 percent off): The best Bose earbuds for most people are getting a decent discount this week. This model gives you the company's powerful ANC and great sound for less than flagship prices. You also get spatial audio and dependable battery life in this affordable option.\nBose Ultra Open Earbuds for $229 (23 percent off): If you thought Bose's clip-on open earbuds were a bit too pricey to splurge on, now's your chance to get them for less. Plus, this model works with the company's soundbars for an enhanced living room listening experience. \nBeats Prime Day deals\n\n\nBeats Solo 4 headphones for $98 (50 percent off): Beats' popular on-ear headphones are half off for Prime Day, which makes them a great deal for fans of that wear style. While they may look similar to their predecessor, the Solo 4 have improved sound and longer battery life compared to that older model.\nBeats Powerbeats Pro 2 earbuds for $180 (28 percent off): Apple's first earbuds with heart rate tracking are slightly discounted for Prime Day. This your chance to try the tech without paying full price. What's more, the Powerbeats Pro 2 have an improved design, the smarts of Apple's H2 chip and powerful bass. \nPrime Day Samsung deals\n\n\nSamsung Galaxy Buds FE for $52 (48 percent off): Samsung's budget earbuds are solid option if you're looking to spend less than $60. Like the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro, these are best-suited for Samsung devices where you'll find features like live translation and automatic switching.\nApple and Google Prime Day deals\nApple AirPods Pro 2 for $149 (40 percent off): The best AirPods you can buy are at their lowest price this year during Prime Day. In addition to hands-free Siri, this model supports advanced features like Apple's hearing test and hearing aid tool, in addition to hearing protection and more. \nApple AirPods 4 for $89 (31 percent off): The redesigned \"regular\" AirPods that debuted last year are currently available well below their normal $129 price tag. Here, you'll get the new, more comfortable shape as well as updated features. \nApple AirPods 4 with ANC for $119 (34 percent off): And if you need some ANC to go with your AirPods, but don't want to go for the Pro 2, here's your best bet. These retain the open-style fit of regular AirPods but add surprisingly effective ANC to the mix. \nApple AirPods Max (USB-C) for $430 (22 percent off): Apple's over-ear headphones are $119 off during Prime Day, which softens the blow to your wallet for this pricey set. They're comfy and offer a lot of handy features for Apple devices. Plus, you can unlock lossless listening with a wired connection. \nGoogle Pixel Buds Pro 2 for $160 (30 percent off): The best earbuds for Pixel phone users are down to $160, which makes them a great purchase right now. Live translate and hands-free access to Gemini might be the highlight, but these earbuds have great sound and capable ANC too. \nPrime Day deals on Dyson\nDyson OnTrac headphones for $300 (40 percent off): This set isn't without its flaws, but I can understand why you'd be drawn to the almost infinitely customizable design and long battery life. There's also real-time hearing health features and the sound is crisp and clear even though it lacks depth and immersion. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/prime-day-2025-the-best-headphone-and-earbud-deals-available-right-now-082347495.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Amazon Prime Day typically brings great discounts on all sorts of electronics, but it’s a good idea to go for the expensive gear first. We consider robot vacuums to be in that category because, while there are solid affordable models available today, you’ll likely still spend at least $200 to get a robovac worth its salt.\nThese are some of the more expensive smart home gadgets you can get, but snagging them on discount during Prime Day can mean saving hundreds off the sticker price. Prime Day deals this year include some of our top picks for the best robot vacuums, slashing prices (in some cases) down to record lows. There are also some decent deals on cordless vacuums as well, if you prefer to invest in a vacuum with a bit more human control. These are the best Prime Day vacuum deals we could find. \nBest Prime Day robot vacuum deals\n\n\nEufy 11S Max robot vacuum for $140 (50 percent off): A favorite budget robot vacuum of ours, the 11S Max has a slim profile that allows it to easily get other some furniture that other robovacs can't reach. It does a good job of sucking up dirt and debris, and even though it doesn't have Wi-Fi connectivity, it comes with a remote control that gives you most of the functions an app would have.\niRobot Roomba 104 Combo robot vacuum and mop for $250 (44 percent off): This combo machine will vacuum and mop on its own, plus it comes with an auto-empty base as well. That means it will automatically empty the dry debris it collects into the base after every cleaning job.\niRobot Roomba Plus 405 for $400 (50 percent off): This newer Roomba model comes with a dock that both empties and refills its mopping reservoir and cleans its mop pad in between uses. In addition to mopping, this machine vacuums and supports smart mapping so you can better target where it should clean on a per-job basis.\nRoborock Q7 M5+ for $250 (42 percent off): This robovac has 10,000Pa suction power, LiDAR navigation, an anti-tangle brush design and Wi-Fi connectivity. It also comes with a self-cleaning base that can hold up to seven weeks of debris before it needs to be emptied.\nShark AV2501S AI Ultra robot vacuum for $280 (49 percent off): A version of our favorite robot vacuum, this Shark machine has strong suction power and won't choke at the first sight of pet hair or big dust bunnies. Its self-emptying base is bagless as well, which means you won't have to buy propriety bags to refill it with over time. This auto-empty base has a 30-day capacity, but you can spend a bit more if you want a model with a 60-day capacity.\nShark PowerDetect NeverTouch Pro robot vacuum and mop for $700 (42 percent off): This Shark machine is one of our favorites in part because it truly lives up to its name. Thanks to its self-emptying dock that handles vacuumed debris along with clean and dirty mopping water, you really don't have to touch the thing for at least 30 days in between cleanings. We found it to be a solid autonomous dirt sucker, and its mopping capabilities are quite good to match.\nBest Prime Day vacuum deals\n\n\nDyson V15 Detect Plus for $570 ($180 off): You can't get much better than a Dyson if you're on the market for a cordless stick vacuum, and the V15 Detect delivers. It's our current top pick for the best cordless vacuum overall thanks to its excellent suction power, lightweight design, good battery life and the included Fluffy Optic cleaning head that uses a laser to show you where all the debris is while you're using it.\nDyson V8 Plus cordless vacuum for $300 (36 percent off): This Dyson stick vacuum has 40 minutes of runtime, a lightweight design and two power modes to choose from. It comes with four attachments, including the Motorbar cleaner head that works on all floor types, and it can easily convert to a more compact handheld vacuum to take out to your car when it needs a cleaning.\nTineco Pure One Station Furfree cordless vacuum for $299 (25 percent off): This cordless vacuum has its own self-emptying base, and it comes with attachments to groom your pets. It has solid suction power and the built-in iLoop smart sensor automatically adjust suction power depending on the messes in its path.\nTineco Pure One Station 5 for $320 (30 percent off): One of our favorite cordless vacuums, the Pure One Station 5 has excellent suction power and good handling, plus a self-emptying base that makes it ultra-convenient. It also sports a single-button start and Tineco's iLoop smart sensor.\nShark PowerDetect Clean & Empty cordless vacuum for $400 (33 percent off): Shark's cordless vacuums are just as good as their robot vacuums, and you can usually find them on sale for less than other major brands. This one has great suction power and a relatively lightweight design, but the fact that it comes with a self-emptying base makes it an ultra-convenient choice.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-amazon-prime-day-2025-robot-vacuum-deals-that-you-can-get-right-now-140049915.html?src=rss",

For very cheap, you can get ahold of 1TB storage space and read speeds up to 540 MB/s, close to the very best possible for a SATA SSD.\nWD_BLACK SN850X for $150 (25 percent off): Our current favorite Gen4 NVMe drive is on sale for Prime Day, making a read speed of over 7,000 MB/s more accessible than ever. In our tests, we found the 1TB SN850X significantly boosted our Windows operating speeds without adding much heat.\nWD Blue SN5000 for $210 (30 percent off): Here's a great deal on an internal SSD with 4TB capacity and compatibility with the fast-performing NVMe protocol. Western Digital, the same brand behind the WD_BLACK (see above) claims the Blue model can hit read speeds of 5,500 MB/s.\nSabrent Rocket 2230 for $150 (45 percent off): The Sabrent Rocket 2230 is a thumbnail-sized NVMe card that we found to be perfect for the M.2 slot on a Steam Deck. Thanks to this deal, you can save a lot by buying a lower-end Steam Deck and upgrading it with one of these.\nSamsung Fit Plus for $23 (34 percent off): The Fit Plus is our favorite thumb drive, and it's not close. Running on USB 3.1 with transfer speeds between 300 and 400 MB/s, it even comes with a keychain hook. The current deal takes 34 percent off an already cheap product.\nSamsung 870 EVO for $76 (24 percent off): The 870 EVO is a great budget choice for general users, who are likely to get a speed boost on any PC activity once it's installed. At 560 MB/s of maximum reading speed, it's not for hardcore gamers, but everyday users should see real benefits.\nSamsung 990 Pro for $150 (29 percent off): The whole Samsung Pro line of SSDs is excellent for gamers, with PS5s in particular seeming to run much faster with one installed. The 990 Pro can reach read speeds of up to 1,400 KB/s — and yes, that's kilobytes, not megabytes.\nSamsung 9100 Pro for $220 (31 percent off): Samsung's first NVMe SSD dropped earlier this year, and currently, they're still a bit faster than most people can use. However, if you want to get a jump on the next console generation with 14,800 MB/s sequential reading speed, this deal is your opportunity.\nKingston Fury Renegade for $420 (33 percent off): Although it sounds like a Jamaican kung fu movie we'd watch the hell out of, the Kingston Fury Renegade is actually a 5th-gen NVMe SSD that can reach hardcore read speeds of up to 14,800 MB/s. It's expensive, but Prime Day discounts knock off 33 percent.\nCorsair MP600 Pro LPX 2 TB for $160 (20 percent off): Earlier this year, we named the Corsair MP600 Pro LPX as the top SSD for PS5, partly due to its affordability. It's even more affordable now — and the low price even includes a heatsink.\nAcer FA100 1TB for $51 (15 percent off): The Acer FA100 isn't the fastest SSD, but it is at least competitive, and may be one of the cheapest ways to harness the considerable power of NVMe 3.0. Only the 1TB version is marked down for Prime Day.\n\nBest Prime Day portable SSD deals\n\nSamsung T7 for $114 (39 percent off): The T7 spent a long time as our reigning champion portable SSD, and it's still an amazing deal — being technically outdated means record-low prices on hardware that's more than fast enough for a Steam Deck or Switch.\nSamsung T9 for $170 (43 percent off): We once named the Samsung T7 as our favorite portable SSD, but the T9 handily outdoes it, nearly doubling data transfer speeds. It's marked down 43 percent from now until the end of Prime Day on the 11th.\nSanDisk 1TB Extreme for $78 (40 percent off): SanDisk designed the Extreme for portability, and it shows — this is an almost indestructible SSD you can keep in just about any bag or pocket. It's also reasonably fast, though it only works with USB-C\nCrucial X9 Pro 1TB for $75 (17 percent off): As a Gen 2 USB drive, the Crucial X9 Pro loses out to some newer competitors on speed — but it's much cheaper, and far more compatible with everyday personal computers. The 1TB model is on sale at 17 percent off its normal price.\nCrucial X9 Pro 2TB for $120 (33 percent off): The Crucial X9 Pro with 2TB storage space is marked down 33 percent for Prime Day.\nCrucial X9 Pro 4TB $260 (10 percent off): If you're after the highest-capacity model of the Crucial X9 Pro, you can grab it for 10 percent off through the end of Prime Day.\nCrucial X10 1TB for $82 (41 percent off): The Crucial X10 is a portable SSD for power users, only working at full strength on devices that support the latest version of USB 3.2. If that's what your build needs, you're not likely to see it much cheaper than this.\nCrucial X10 2TB for $135 (18 percent off): A 2TB version of the X10 is almost 20 percent off right now.\nCrucial X10 Pro 2TB for $150 (28 percent off): The Crucial X10 Pro is perfect for a fairly small range of users. If your PC build currently works with USB 3.2 Gen 2x2 but isn't yet handling USB4 or Thunderbolt, you won't find a faster portable SSD for your needs.\nKingston XS1000 for $80 (15 percent off): We named the Kingston XS1000 the second-best portable SSD in our current roundup, so it's great to see it going for 15 percent off today. It's almost as fast as the Crucial X9 Pro, just not quite as tough.\nADATA SE920 for $142 (5 percent off): The piddly 5 percent off is disappointing, but there's nothing disappointing about the ADATA SE920 itself. This is the ideal model for anyone regularly making huge downloads. The SE920's maximum read speed of 3,800 MB/s would be impressive for a full-size SSD, but it's fully portable, weighing less than half a pound.\nGarmese 1TB Portable SSD for $64 (20 percent off): This portable SSD uses USB3.2 to achieve read speeds of around 1000 MB/s, which is very impressive for a device not much larger than a flash drive. While it downloads fast, it's not fantastic for transferring multiple files at a time.\n\nBest Prime Day microSD card deals\n\nLexar Professional Silver Plus for $38 (48 percent off): Our tests showed this to be the fastest microSD card on the market, beating out the whole Samsung line. Not only is it fast enough to download and upload 4K files without trying your patience, it's also waterproof, cheap and squeezes in both USB-A and USB-C ports.\nLexar E-Series for $31 (15 percent off): While the Silver Plus beats it out, the Lexar E-Series remains more than fast enough for 4K video, and is sufficiently rugged to fit in your adventure camera. This deal includes a five-pack of microSD cards, working out to about six dollars per 64GB of storage.\nSamsung Pro Plus for $17 (35 percent off): The Samsung Pro Plus is a great microSD card for most needs, so if it's cheaper than the Lexar option, go for it. We've found that it's particularly good in handheld game systems. Just make sure to get the version rated for 180 MB/s, nothing less (it should say on the package).\nSanDisk Ultra 256GB microSDXC for $17 (15 percent off): If you're still rocking the Switch 1 (thanks, Target) and want a cheap storage expander, this deal on a SanDisk 256GB microSD card is for you. It's going for $17 right now, far less than most of the games you're likely to store on it.\nSamsung Evo Select for $22 (27 percent off): This one's by far the best option if you're after a cheap microSD card — we've seen it on sale for less than $25 more than once. It's a bit too slow for cameras, but fine for any kind of undemanding passive storage.\n\nBest Prime Day external hard drive deals\n\nSeagate Portable for $65 (18 percent off): All the Seagate hard drives we've used are refreshingly good at combining thin, light hardware with consistent speeds, and the Portable is no exception. At 4TB, this is a great deal on an external HDD with no tradeoffs.\nSeagate Game Drive for $76 (15 percent off): Seagate's Game Drive is a prime choice for adding extra space to a PS5 or Xbox Series X. Formerly overpriced, it's now dropped down to $90 for 2 TB, and that's before Prime Day makes it even cheaper.\nWD My Passport for $160 (14 percent off): The Western Digital My Passport line is ancient by computer hardware standards, but it's been updated as far as USB 3.0 and 3.1, and remains one of the cheaper options for a 6 TB hard drive. This version includes automatic backup software.\nWD Elements for $149 (15 percent off): The Elements HDD from Western Digital has gotten consistently positive feedback from our staff over the years, and as an older model, it's now wildly cheap for 6 TB of storage. It's compatible with both PC and Mac out of the box.\nWD_BLACK P10 Game Drive for $161 (15 percent off): We're big fans of the WD_BLACK SSD, and the gaming-focused external P10 is a worthy companion. It comes with 6 TB of storage for your PC, PS5, or Xbox gaming library.\nUnionSine 500GB External Hard Drive for $27 (19 percent off): UnionSine's HDD is fast and USB3 compatible. Despite how thin and light it is, we've found it remarkably hard to damage. 500GB may be a bit tight with the size of files these days, but at this price, you could just buy two of them.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-prime-day-ssd-and-external-hard-drive-deals-on-samsung-crucial-and-more-090355162.html?src=rss",
    "full_text": "Prime Day is a great time to pick up gear and upgrades you wouldn't normally think about. Crucial P310 1TB for $70 (6 percent off): This deal on the Crucial P310 is one of the best we've seen so far for a Gen 4 SSD. At the 1TB capacity, it reads up to 7,100MB per second for noticeably faster performance. WD_BLACK SN850X for $150 (25 percent off): Our current favorite Gen4 NVMe drive is on sale for Prime Day, making a read speed of over 7,000 MB/s more accessible than ever.

    "summary": "Amazon Prime Day is usually met with competing sales from other retailers, and this year is no different. Walmart’s summer sale is back this year, competing with Prime Day and running for an extra two days. You can shop the sale at Walmart from July 8 through July 13, snagging discounts on all sorts of things including tech.\nWhile Engadget covers all of the best Prime Day deals we can find, we also recognize that not everyone has a Prime membership — and many simply do not want to shop at Amazon. If you fall into either of those camps, you will be able to find some of the best Prime Day deals matched at Walmart. Most of these deals are available to everyone, too — no Walmart Plus membership required as of July 8. Here, we’ve collected the best Walmart Deals savings we could find for day two of the sale, and we’ll continue to update this post throughout the event as we discover new discounts.\nBest Walmart Deals 2025 discounts\nRoku Express HD streaming device for $17 ($12 off): If you're simply looking for an affordable streamer to upgrade an aging TV, the Roku Express HD could fit the bill. It plays HD-quality content and gives you access to every major streaming platform including HBO Max, Disney+, Prime Video and others. It'll tuck away behind your set nicely and it supports headphone mode, which lets you connect headphones to the Roku mobile app for private listening and viewing from your TV.\nHisense 75-inch U6H ULED 4K smart TV for $448 (36 percent off): This Quantum Dot TV can reach 600 nits at peak brightness across its 48 local dimming zones. It supports Dolby Vision and Atmos, HDMI 2.1 inputs for a better gaming experience and it has the Google Assistant built in for voice control.\nSamsung 32-inch Smart Monitor M5 for $199 ($100 off): Not only will this be a good monitor for your home office setup, but it also acts as a full smart TV, too. Its interface gives you access to platforms like Netflix, Prime Video, YouTube and others, and it also comes with a SmartThings IoT hub built in so you can connect and control things like smart lights directly from the monitor.\nSamsung Galaxy Watch 6 for $129 (47 percent off): While it's an older model, we generally like Samsung Galaxy Watches and they're arguably the best smartwatches for Samsung phone users. The Galaxy Watch 6 has good all-day activity tracking and sleep monitoring, plus heart rate tracking, personalized health insights and more.\nApple MacBook Air (13-inch, M1) for $599 ($50 off): The M1 Air has been long gone from Apple's own site, but it's still a more than capable laptop for anyone looking for a solid, all-purpose machine. We still recommend springing for an M3 or M4 machine instead, but if you're on a budget, this deal will be hard to beat.\nSony WH-1000XM5 headphones for $296 ($104 off): While the XM6 headphones are the latest and greatest, they only make small changes to the already stellar XM5. These were our top pick for the best wireless headphones for a long time before the XM6 launched earlier this year, and we still like them for their excellent sound quality, strong ANC, multi-device connectivity and good battery life.\nGoogle TV Streamer 4K for $84 ($16 off): Our top favorite streaming device, the Google TV Streamer 4K is basically a souped-up Chromecast with 4K content support, an easy to use interface and a great remote control.\nRazer Kraken Hello Kitty & Friends Bluetooth headset for $47 (47 percent off): Razer makes excellent gaming accessories and this Hello Kitty & Friends version of the popular Kraken headset might be just what you were looking for to add more personality into your Twitch stream outfits. Aside from the cute design, it supports Bluetooth 5.0, comes with 40mm drivers and sports a beamforming microphone.\nMSI Thin A15 gaming laptop (15.6-inch, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD) for $649 (37 percent off): Along with a Ryzen processor, this MSI gaming laptop sports a NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060 GPU and a 144Hz screen, and it comes in at just about 4 pounds in weight.\nPlayStation 5 Slim Astro Bot bundle for $453 ($106 off): This version of the console has a disc drive and comes with 1TB of storage, plus the ever-popular Astro Bot game.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/walmart-deals-2025-are-live-with-a-bunch-of-anti-prime-day-sales-to-shop-now-230146548.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Amazon Prime Day is in full swing, and there are plenty of deals to shop through the end of the sale on July 11. Right now you can pick up the Apple Watch Series 10 for $120 off its normal price. That’s the lowest we’ve ever seen it, and trust us, 30 percent off a current-generation Apple product is not easy to come by.\nIt’s hard to believe that the Apple Watch is already ten years old. It seems like only yesterday that we got our hands on the first generation, and now the Apple Watch Series 10 is counting the days until the next generation is announced. Whether you’re looking to upgrade from an older Apple Watch or this is your first time buying an Apple smartwatch (though keep in mind an iPhone is required to use an Apple Watch), this sale is a great opportunity to pick one up at a fantastic value. \n\n\nThe tenth generation of the Apple Watch represents a powerhouse of computing on your wrist. In our hands-on review, we loved the comprehensive health and fitness tracking capabilities on the watch, which has been a strong niche for Apple. We were sad to see the blood oxygen app removed following a patent dispute, but features like fall detection and sleep apnea tracking are still intact. It’s also the thinnest Apple Watch yet, feeling more like a slim accessory than a bulky gadget. We gave the Apple Watch 10 a score of 90 out of 100, and it remains our top pick for best smartwatch.\nIf you're looking to send less, consider the Apple Watch SE. You can grab one for only $169 right now, or 32 percent off its usual price. It doesn't have all the bells, whistles and extra sensors that the Series 10 does, but you'll still get the core Apple Watch experience with excellent activity tracking, heart rate monitoring, smart alerts and more.\n\n\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-apple-watch-series-10-falls-to-a-new-record-low-price-for-prime-day-152348433.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Prime Day is the time to trawl Amazon for the best in all things, including high-quality speakers at bargain prices. For much less than usual, you can add a new lynchpin to your soundsystem. That could be a space-saving soundbar for a smaller space, a smart speaker to jam out while you're busy in the kitchen or a bluetooth speaker you can bring with you anywhere. We've rounded up a list that includes Echo, JBL, Beats, Anker Soundcore and more of the best audio brands — so if you're ready to hear every last eighth-note of your favorite tracks, let's get started.\nBest Prime Day Bluetooth speaker deals\nOur portable bluetooth speaker picks are some of the best all-around mobile music devices to ever hit the shelves: smaller and lighter than a boombox, better audio than an iPod, and way easier in the long run than learning to play guitar. We've sifted through Prime Day offerings to find the best portable speakers in all shapes and sizes. \n\n\n\nTribit Stormbox Micro 2 for $56 (20 percent off): This tiny portable speaker packs a wallop — you won't believe how high you can crank the volume on such a small, light device. Weighing in at about one pound, it includes a rubber strap for attaching it to your backpack or bike, and comes with a USB charging port.\nBeats Pill for $98 (35 percent off): The Beats Pill is one of the few portable bluetooth speakers we liked enough to give it a full review. Those of you who love the classic Beats bluetooth speakers will be happy to know they're back in fine form. Nobody can beat the Pill for bass, and its sound is crisp and lossless at almost any frequency and volume. For some reason, only the Kim Kardashian branded version is on sale, but it's the exact same speaker.\nSoundcore Motion 300 for $53 (34 percent off): The Motion 300 is that rare portable speaker that outperforms at both high and low frequencies. Its upper range goes into 40 kHz, while its bass can deliver bone-shaking thumps even outdoors. All that in 1.7 pounds with 13 hours of battery life — and it's even partially waterproof.\nAnker Soundcore Motion+ for $75 (24 percent off): Tough, sturdy construction makes this speaker an excellent choice for home bluetooth. Its battery lasts for 12 hours in the wild, and it always sounds great, but it's a bit heavy for pedaling through the park. There's also an option for wired connections, and it even works as a backup soundbar.\nAnker Soundcore 2 for $28 (38 percent off): The Soundcore 2 is an older bluetooth speaker, but it holds up — fully waterproof, with 24 hours of battery life and bass you can hear on the other side of a pool. It's on sale for less than $30.\nUE Everboom for $190 (30 percent off): If you want something stronger than the Wonderboom but the Hyperboom isn't portable enough, the Everboom is a great middle ground. Its ideal range is a little narrow, but it makes up for that with 360-degree sound and extreme durability (i.e. so waterproof it literally floats).\nJBL Go 3 for $28 (30 percent off): The JBL Go 3 improves on its predecessor with a carabiner-friendly design, five hours of battery life, and IP67-rated waterproofing and dustproofing. It's not exactly powerful, but it's way better than a phone speaker for driving, trekking or camping.\nJBL Go 3 Eco for $28 (30 percent off): This is the same as the JBL Go 3, but made from mostly recycled materials — 90 percent of the plastic and 100 percent of the fabric is post-consumer.\nJBL Pulse 5 for $200 (20 percent off): The Pulse 5 is JBL's latest and greatest party speaker, throwing out 360-degree light bursts that sync up to the music. There's substance behind the flash, too, with speakers designed around the bass frequencies and 12 hours of battery life.\nBose SoundLink Flex 2nd Gen for $99 (33 percent off): This mini speaker from Bose is one of our favorites on the list for hands-free phone calls. It supports both Google Assistant and Siri and runs up to 12 hours on one charge, all while being smaller than a clutch purse. It also kills as a portable music player, though the sound doesn't stretch far enough to fill a room.\nBose Soundlink Revolve+ Series II for $179 (40 percent off): The Revolve series was Bose's first line of 360-degree outdoor speakers, and they're still a strong choice today. The Revolve+ weighs about two pounds and can run for 17 hours without recharging.\nBose Soundlink Max for $299 (25 percent off): Bose's Soundlink Max marries a classic carrying-case design with audio that sounds like it's coming from a much bigger unit. It comes with a 20-hour battery and IP67-rated protection against the elements.\nMarshall Emberton II for $95 (47 percent off): Marshall has been making audio equipment for more than 60 years, and still has a thing or two to teach the young'ns. The Emberton II looks like a classic amp, but weighs a quarter of a pound and provides balanced sound for more than 30 hours per charge.\nMarshall Acton III for $200 (33 percent off): All right, so a six-pound speaker isn't exactly portable — but if you can stand lugging it around, the Acton III can be a highly versatile device. From music to outdoor parties to pulling double duty as a soundbar, this is a low-setup, low-overhead option for nearly all audio tasks.\n\nBest Prime Day smart speaker deals\nSmart speakers aren't just about getting a disembodied voice to do your bidding (or at least as much of your bidding as Alexa can do without hands). On top of assistant support, the picks below serve up legitimately great audio quality alongside useful extra features. The only downside is that they're often overpriced, but that's what Prime Day is for.\n\nAmazon Echo Dot for $32 (36 percent off): Amazon may not have updated the Echo Dot since 2022, but that just goes to show how well this spherical smart speaker serves as the perfect host for Alexa. Both music and speech sound clear, and it's easy to integrate with other smart home devices. Right now, it's marked down more than a third.\nAmazon Echo Pop for $22 (45 percent off): The latest Echo Pop release continues the trend of making Alexa's best features available on a mini-sized, reasonably priced device. Its half-spherical design fits on any desk or shelf, and its sound output is consistently clear — and gets louder than you might believe.\nSonos Era 100 for $179 (10 percent off): Smart speakers from the Amazon Echo line play perfectly good music, but true audiophiles in need of assistant support should look to Sonos. The Era 100 has tweeters and woofers precisely arranged for clear, full-room sound, and it's easy to hook up to your other audio gear. Just be warned it only supports Alexa, not Google Assistant.\nJBL Authentics 200 for $200 (47 percent off): JBL's Authentics line is modeled after a product it sold in the 70s. Its old-school bookshelf-friendly design belies its advanced feat of running Google Assistant and Alexa simultaneously (as opposed to other smart speakers where you have to pick just one).\nJBL Authentics 300 for $300 (33 percent off): The JBL Authentics 300 can host both Alexa and Google Assistant at the same time, which impressed us enough that we gave it a full review. While we had some issues — namely its tendency to over-emphasize vocals — we can't quibble with its high-range performance or retro design.\n\nBest Prime Day soundbar deals\nFlatter, lighter and larger TV screens are nice for visuals, but often sacrifice sound quality to lose weight. If you've found yourself turning on the subtitles for your shows more often lately, you might need a soundbar to augment your TV's built-in speakers. We found a few of the best on sale for Prime Day — Sonos leads this space, but it's not without competitors.\n\nBose Smart for $400 (20 percent off): In our full review of the Bose Smart, we noted that two drivers in the center make its sound feel directional without any other speakers needed — simply cranking up those makes any audio more immersive. You can also link it to a pair of Ultra Open Earbuds (not included) for a private surround sound experience.\nBose Smart Ultra for $700 (22 percent off): The Smart Ultra upgrades the Bose Smart with a more sophisticated calibration system which adjusts sound settings to fill whatever room it's in. If you want the Smart's personal surround experience for more than one person, the Smart Ultra is for you.\nSonos Beam for $369 (26 percent off): The Sonos Beam is a fantastic choice for a mid-budget soundbar. It's one of the most accessible Dolby Atmos systems, and uses careful audio alterations to achieve a much more immersive sound than other bars of its size.\nSonos Ray for $169 (15 percent off): If you're looking to pay a bit less, go with the Sonos Ray to maximize sound quality on a budget. The audio won't wrap around your room like it might from a more premium model, but it's still a vast improvement on nearly all built-in TV speakers.\nSony HT-S400 for $178 (41 percent off): Sony built the HT-S400 for everyone who wants a soundbar but not an entire home theater. It's a 2.1-channel system that still manages immersive surround sound and is easy to integrate with Sony TVs. Right now, it's 40 percent off, one of the best prices we've seen on any soundbar.\nSony Bravia Theater Bar 6 for $448 (31 percent off): One of Sony's newest audio products, the Bravia Theater Bar 6 is a 3.1.2 soundbar that can bend audio in more directions to fill your theater space. It can handle Dolby Atmos, and has an integrated AI feature that recognizes and clarifies human voices.\nVIZIO 2.0 for $78 (22 percent off): Vizio's budget soundbar makes a worthy alternative to the Sonos Ray. It punches above its weight and gets as close as possible to Dolby Atmos surround sound as a single unit can manage. For less than $100, you'll never mishear a line of dialogue again.\nJBL Bar 9.1 for $760 (37 percent off): The 9.1 is JBL's first sound bar to be compatible with Dolby Atmos, and it doesn't disappoint. Each unit comes with two wireless speakers you can move around your viewing room, and there's even a 4K passthrough input to ensure your sound system doesn't mess with image quality.\nSennheiser Ambeo Mini for $600 (25 percent off): We recommend the Sennheiser Ambeo Mini for a relatively cheap premium soundbar. It excels in smaller spaces (though it needs an extra subwoofer to fill larger ones), and its connected app includes several sound presets you can use to optimize its virtual speakers.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/best-prime-day-speaker-deals-on-jbl-bose-sonos-and-others-085948443.html?src=rss",
    "full_text": "For much less than usual, you can add a new lynchpin to your soundsystem. We've sifted through Prime Day offerings to find the best portable speakers in all shapes and sizes. Smart speakers aren't just about getting a disembodied voice to do your bidding (or at least as much of your bidding as Alexa can do without hands). On top of assistant support, the picks below serve up legitimately great audio quality alongside useful extra features. Amazon Echo Dot for $32 (36 percent off): Amazon may not have updated the Echo Dot since 2022, but that just goes to show how well this spherical smart speaker serves as the perfect host for Alexa. Amazon Echo Pop for $22 (45 percent off): The latest Echo Pop release continues the trend of making Alexa's best features available on a mini-sized, reasonably priced device. Sonos Era 100 for $179 (10 percent off): Smart speakers from the Amazon Echo line play perfectly good music, but true audiophiles in need of assistant support should look to Sonos.

    "summary": "While you can often find discounts on Echo speakers, Fire tablets, Kindles and other Amazon devices throughout the year, Amazon Prime Day is the best time to buy them, period. Prime Day is basically Black Friday for all Amazon-made gear, provided you’re a Prime me\nmber who can actually participate in the members-only shopping event. In recent years, Prime Day discounts on these gadgets have even been better than those we’ve seen during the holiday shopping season. For Amazon Prime Day 2025, you’ll find most of Amazon’s devices on sale for record-low prices (or close to them). These are the best Prime Day deals you can get on Kindles, Fire TVs, Echos and more. \nPrime Day Echo deals\n\n\nEcho Pop speaker for $22 (45 percent off): One of the newer Echo devices available, the Pop it sports a 1.95-inch front-facing speaker and a physical mic mute switch for extra privacy. The Pop also has built-in eero compatibility, so it can extend the area of your home Wi-Fi network if you already have an eero router system.\nEcho Buds for $45 (68 percent off): Amazon's main earbud offering, the Echo Buds are one of our top picks for the best budget wireless earbuds you can get right now. Their design allows some outside sound in, which some will prefer over total noise cancellation, and they have a comfortable design with a pocket-friendly case, automatic wear detection, multi-device connectivity and, of course, built-in Alexa voice controls.\nEcho Show 5 for $60 (33 percent off): This model is one of our favorite smart displays thanks to its compact design, ambient light sensor and sunrise alarm feature, all of which make it an excellent smart alarm clock. Amazon improved the speaker quality on this latest model, which gives sound deeper bass and clearer vocals.\nEcho Show 8 for $110 (27 percent off): This is our current top pick for the best smart display with Amazon’s Alexa thanks in part to its 8-inch touchscreen, 13MP camera that supports auto-framing for better video chats and its built-in Zigbee smart home hub. The 2023 model supports Visual ID, which will show personalized information on the device’s display depending on who’s using it, and video streaming from Netflix, Hulu, Prime Video and other services.\nPrime Day Kindle deals\n\n\nKindle Kids for $95 ($35 off): This is the same device as the base Kindle, but it becomes more kid-friendly thanks to the included cover, two-year warranty and the included year of Amazon Kids+, which gives children ages 3-12 access to hundreds of appropriate ebooks and audiobooks. Just be sure to take note when you activate that subscription because it will renew after one year at the standard $6/month rate.\nKindle Paperwhite for $125 ($35 off): The latest version of the Paperwhite has a seven-inch display, thinner bezels, an adjustable warm light, speedier page turns and a battery that can last up to 12 weeks on a single charge. This model is also IPX8 waterproof and has built-in Audible integration.\nKindle Colorsoft for $180 ($100 off): Amazon's only color e-reader has a seven-inch, high-contrast display, an auto-adjusting front light, a color highlighting feature and an eight-week battery life.\nKindle Scribe for $260 ($140 off): The Scribe is one of the best E-Ink tablets you can buy at the moment, and certainly the top pick if you want a writable table that also excels as an ereader. It provides a great reading and writing experience, thanks in part to its ability to access the entire Kindle ebook library, and it has handy Google Drive, Microsoft OneDrive and Dropbox integration.\nPrime Day Fire TV deals\n\n\nFire TV Stick 4K for $25 (50 percent off): This is the cheapest Fire TV Stick you can get to stream 4K content, plus it has support for Wi-Fi 6 and Dolby Vision and Atmos. With its live picture-in-picture feature, you can view security camera feeds right on your TV while you’re watching your favorite show or movie.\nFire TV Stick 4K Max for $35 (42 percent off): In addition to 4K HDR streaming with Dolby Vision and Atmos support, the 4K Max dongle includes Wi-Fi 6E connectivity, 16GB of built-in storage and live picture-in-picture capabilities. It also supports the Fire TV “ambient experience,” which lets you display photos and images on your TV screen when you’re not actively watching something.\nFire TV Cube streaming box for $90 (36 percent off): This model will provide the best performance of any Fire TV streaming device, and it supports 4K HDR content, Dolby Vision and Atmos and an enhanced version of the Alexa Voice Remote. Along with live picture-in-picture view and the Fire TV ambient experience, you can also hardware other devices to the Fire TV Cube including a cable box or a game console.\nPrime Day Fire tablet deals\n\n\nFire HD 8 tablet for $55 (45 percent off): This is Amazon's most bare-bones tablet, featuring an eight-inch HD touchscreen, hexa-core processor and 13 hours of battery life. The improvements in the screen quality alone from the old-school Fire 7 tablet make it a better buy for most people, and this slab would make a good couch device for general web browsing, email checking, online shopping and more.\nFire Max 11 tablet for $140 (39 percent off): Amazon’s most powerful tablet, the Fire Max 11 sports an 11-inch 2,000 x 1,200 touchscreen, an octa-core processor, up to 128GB of storage and 14 hours of battery life. It also works with a number of optional accessories, including a stylus and keyboard case.\nFire HD 10 Kids tablet for $105 (45 percent off): This slab is designed for kids aged three to seven, with full parental controls plus one year of Amazon Kids+ for free with the tablet purchase. This model has a 10-inch FHD touchscreen, an octa-core processor and 13 hours of battery life, plus it comes with a two-year warranty and a protective case.\nFire HD 10 Kids Pro tablet for $105 (45 percent off): This model is designed for kids aged six to 12 and comes with a slimmer protective case, a two-year warranty and one year of access to Amazon Kids+. Otherwise, you get a very similar experience here that you would with the non-Pro version, including parental controls, a 10-inch touchscreen, solid performance and a 13-hour battery life.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-prime-day-deals-on-amazon-devices-save-on-kindle-ereaders-echo-speakers-and-more-082012377.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Amazon’s July Prime Day sale is here, and it’s one of the best times of the year to stock up on accessories and smaller electronics. For this guide, we’ve rounded up the best Prime Day tech deals for $50 and under. You can grab cables, chargers, smart speakers, microSD cards, streaming sticks, Bluetooth trackers and more for a lot less than usual. But these aren’t just any gadgets, our picks are pulled from the products and brands we recommend based on Engadget’s own testing and reviews. Read on for the best Prime Day deals we could find on tech that costs less than $50.\nThe best Prime Day tech deals under $25\n\n\nSamsung Galaxy SmartTag2 Bluetooth tracker for $16 ($14 off): If you have a Samsung phone, the company’s own Bluetooth tracker may make the most sense for you. We say as much in our guide to these finding fobs. The design is attractive and the finding network admirable, drawing on the signals of nearby Galaxy devices to pinpoint your lost keys. \nAnker Right-Angle USB-C braided charging cable (two-pack) for $10 ($6 off with Prime): This is the cable I used to turn an old iPad into a digital picture frame. The right-angle looks much neater than a straight cable, plus this one can shuttle up to 240 watts of power during charging.\nAnker iPhone Nano Power Bank with Built-in USB-C Connector for $24 ($6 off with Prime): One of these little guys could represent the difference between a dead phone and a not-dead phone. It’s the size of an oldey-timey lipstick case and delivers a partial charge to any USB-C phone. We tested it out and awarded it a spot in our guide to power banks. The current discount only applies to the black colorway, and this is higher than the all-time low of $16 it hit for Black Friday.\nJLab Go Sport+ workout earbuds for $20 ($10 off): Anyone looking for a cheap set of beater earbuds for the gym should check this out. It’s a recommendation in our guide to the best budget wireless earbuds and offers a solid eight-to-nine hours of battery life, passable (if somewhat compressed) sound and a water-resistant, around-the-ear design.\nAmazon Echo Buds for $25 (50 percent off with Prime): In our guide to the best budget earbuds, we called Amazon’s latest earbuds the best option for an open-ear design. That means they don’t go all the way in your ear canal, which is far more comfortable for some people. They’re sturdy, comfortable and the sound is decent once you’ve fiddled with the EQ settings to bring down the treble. This matches a previous low price — but is a bit more than a temporary Lightning deal for $15 that hit early on Tuesday.\nTP-Link Kasa Smart Bulbs for (four pack) for $22 (31 percent off): After testing a bunch of bulbs we deemed these the best value. Installation is easy, even for those new to smart devices, thanks to Kasa’s clean and simple app. Just note that voice control is only available with Alexa or the Google Assistant; Siri is unfortunately incompatible with these.\nAnker Nano USB-C charger block for $12 ($6 off): Remember when tiny bricks like this all maxed out at a dinky five-watts? This tiny but mighty cube is the best cheap fast charger in our guide to fast chargers and it outputs a generous 30 watts, plus the prongs fold down to make it even more teensy.\nKasa TP-Link Smart Wi-FI outdoor plug for $17 ($8 off with Prime): We tested this one for our buying guide to smart plugs and named it the best outdoor pick for HomeKit users — but it’ll work with Alexa and the Google Assistant too. The range was decent and setup was easy, like most TP-Link plugs. Grab this now and have automatic control of your holiday lights.\nBlink Mini 2 security camera for $20 ($20 off with Prime): If you only want one Blink security camera, snag this deal. But if you can spring for a two-pack at $35, it's actually a better deal. Either way, it's our pick for the best budget security camera. Just note it requires a subscription for person detection and cloud storage, and the image quality wasn’t the best of the bunch. \nJLab Go Sport+ wireless Earbuds for $20 ($10 off): Here’s a pick from our list of the best budget wireless earbuds. The around-the-ear hook design stays in place during rigorous movement and they’re water-resistant enough to handle sweaty sessions at the gym.\nAmazon Fire TV Stick HD for $18 ($17 off with Prime): We name this the best budget streaming stick on our list of the best streaming devices. It's easy to set up and so you can access all of the major streaming platforms. Just note that it only streams content at 1080p, not 4K and the UI is more ad-heavy than competing streamers.\nApple AirTag for $20 ($9 off): Here’s our pick for a Bluetooth tracker for iPhone users. These little discs have the most accurate finding ability of any fob we tested, thanks to Apple’s vast Find My network that taps into all nearby iPhones to track down your missing stuff. They could be louder and hole would be nice, but nothing beats its accuracy. Just note that you'll get a cheaper per-tag price if you buy a four-pack. \nSamsung Fit Plus 56GB flash drive for $23 ($12 off): We named this the best thumbstick drive in our guide to the best SSDs. It has a sleek design, five-year warranty and has a USB 3.1 connection. There’s even a small attachment point for a keychain so you can take your extra storage drive with you when you go.\nJ-Tech Digital Ergonomic Mouse for $15 ($10 off with Prime and on-page coupon): The lowest price we’ve seen for one of our favorite ergonomic mice is $17 and now it’s even cheaper. This is the budget pick in our ergonomic mouse guide thanks to its vertical format, programmable buttons and nifty RBC lights (which you can turn off).\nAnker USB-C Cable 240W Bio-Braided for $13 ($6 off with Prime): We recommend this in our guide to iPhone accessories. It’s a reliable cable that’s durable and capable of fast charging (provided you have the right wall adapters). This matches its price in past sales.\nThermacell E55 Rechargeable Repeller for $18 ($17 off with Prime): The mosquitos aren’t going anywhere. Even places that didn’t used to have these evil bloodsuckers are now overrun. If you would like some reprieve from the bites, this is the repeller we recommend in our guide to outdoor tech.\nTP-Link AC1200 WiFi extender for $20 ($10 off): If you’ve got some dead spots in your home’s internet coverage and aren’t quite ready for a mesh setup, a Wi-Fi extender can help. This is our favorite budget option in our guide to these plug-in devices thanks to its easy setup and user-friendly app.\nAmazon Echo Pop for $22 ($18 off with Prime): The smallest (and cheapest) Echo speaker is ideal for small apartments or rooms. The half-sphere design comes in purple and teal in addition to the standard black and white colorways. It's gone as low as $18 in past Prime Day sales. \nSoundcore Select 4 Go Bluetooth speaker for $19 ($16 off with Prime): One of the newest additions to our guide to the best Bluetooth speakers is this ‘lil guy from Soundcore (Anker). We found it had decent sound quality and was loud enough to fill a standard-sized living room. It's gone as low at $20 in the past.\nChipolo POP Bluetooth tracker for $25 ($4 off): The top pick in our guide to the best Bluetooth trackers was finally knocked off its throne — by another tracker from the same brand. This is our current recommendation for most people. It taps into either Apple’s Find My or Google’s Find My Device network (but just one at a time) and has a loud ring, quick Bluetooth connection and comes in fun colors.\nAmazon Smart Plug for $13 ($12 off with Prime): This plug and an Alexa Echo device makes a perfect smart home starter kit (and a number of Echos are on sale for Prime Day, too). Snap this into your outlet and Alexa should automatically detect it (if not, a few taps in the Alexa app should get things connected). Then you can use it to control any lamp, fan or other simple device you plug into it — just by asking the assistant.\nRoku Streaming Stick HD for $20 ($10 off): Roku just released two new streaming sticks this year. This standard model and the Plus model that supports 4K resolution. We recommend the latter in our guide to streaming sticks as the best way to catch free and live content, but if you don't have a 4K TV (or don't care about the resolution) you can grab this stick for 33 percent off. The Plus model is also on sale. \nThe best Prime Day tech deals under $35\n\n\nTP-Link Kasa Smart Plug Mini EP25 (4-pack) for $30 ($14 off with Prime): This is our favorite smart plug overall because it works with all four major smart home assistants (Alexa, Siri, Google Assistant and Samsung’s Bixby). In our tests, it connected easily and reliably controlled our lamps and other simple appliances.\nBlink Mini 2 security camera (two-pack) for $35 ($35 off with Prime): Our pick for the best budget security camera is now even more budget friendly. We appreciated this diminutive camera’s ease of setup and excellent integration with Alexa devices, like Echo speakers and displays. It requires a subscription for person detection and cloud storage, and the image quality wasn’t the best of the bunch. If you just need one camera, you can pick one up for $20.\nJBL Go 3 for $28 (30 percent off): The JBL Go 4 gets a shout out in our guide to Bluetooth speakers, this is its predecessor. It's got a carabiner-friendly design, five hours of battery life, and IP67-rated waterproofing and dustproofing. It's not exactly powerful, but it's way better than a phone speaker for driving, trekking or camping.\nRoku Streaming Stick Plus for $30 ($10 off): Roku replaced the Streaming Stick 4K with this model (which also supports 4K) earlier this year. We think it’s the best streaming stick for people who want to access free and live content on their TV. Roku’s interface is easy to use, colorful and lets you watch thousands of hours of free stuff, through Roku’s own content and more. You also get decently organized access to your paid content.\nAnker USB C Charger (Nano 65W) for $26 ($14 off with Prime): This is a similar model to the travel pick in our fast charger guide. It has three ports, two USB-C that deliver up to 65 watts each and a USB-A that can output 22 watts. That should refill your laptop, tablet and maybe some earbuds while not taking up too much space.\nAmazon Echo Dot Kids with Alexa for $32 ($28 off with Prime): The kids version of Amazon's smart speaker is the same hardware but with a kid-themed cover (owl or dragon) and it comes with a free year-long subscription to Amazon Kids+ with audiobooks, games and educational Alexa skills. The standard Echo Dot is on sale too, but we're disappointed in the sale price.  \nBlink Video Doorbell for $30 ($30 off with Prime): If you already use Alexa in your home and want a compatible video doorbell, you may want to check out this deal. Note that you’ll need a Blink subscription and a Blink Sync Module to store clips and to access other features. You can wire it to your existing doorbell wires or use it wirelessly with two AA batteries that can last up to two years.\nMoft Magnetic Phone Tripod for $32 ($8 off with Prime): I was impressed with how sturdily this small tripod held my phone. It folds down super thin but pops up to hold the phone in landscape or portrait orientation. The only downside is you’ll need to pop it off to wirelessly recharge (obviously) but removal and reattachment is quick.\nEarFun Free 2S wireless earbuds for $28 (30 percent off with Prime): These are fairly comfortable, have a good waterproof rating and deliver a decent amount of bass. They’re not going to deliver the fullest or most nuanced sound as more expensive buds, but for far less than $50, they’re a fine knockaround pair.\nAnker Soundcore 2 for $28 (38 percent off): The Soundcore 2 is an older bluetooth speaker, but it holds up — fully waterproof, with 24 hours of battery life and bass you can hear on the other side of a pool. It's on sale for less than $30. \n-> If you're looking for more speaker deals, check out our Prime Day speaker guide. \nThe best Prime Day tech deals under $50\n\n\nSoundcore by Anker Space A40 earbuds for $45 ($35 off with Prime): The top overall pick in our guide to the best budget earbuds delivers the kind of performance and features we’d expect from buds priced twice as high. These lil guys have effective active noise cancellation and a good battery life of eight hours — plus another 40 with the case.\nLexar Professional Silver Plus (512GB) for $38 ($35 off): We found this microSD card to be the best value of all the cards we tested. It consistently delivered faster sequential reads and writes than other models. If you need storage for your gaming handhels, camera, drone or other devices, may as well stock up now. \nHyperX Cloud Stinger 2 gaming headset for $37 ($14 off): In our guide to gaming headsets, we ultimately recommend getting an external mic along with a good pair of wired headphones for chatting. But if you really want a two-in-one, the Cloud Stinger 2 is our pick for a budget gaming headset.\nRazer Basilisk V3 gaming mouse for $36 ($34 off with Prime): Some prefer a wired connection when playing games. Razer’s Basilisk V3 is our top budget pick for a wired mouse in our gaming mouse guide. It’s comfortable, well-built, accurate and a good value — particularly with a Prime Day discount.\nAmazon Echo Spot for $45 ($35 off with Prime): The Spot speaker was resurrected last year with a slightly different design than it first had. Now the display is a half-circle on the round face of the clock and it can show you the weather, time and song title. The speaker itself brings you all Alexa can do, like setting timers, adding stuff to your grocery lists and answering questions about the weather.\nLeebin Electric Spin Scrubber for $38 (46 percent off): This was Deputy Editor Valentina Palladino's favorite thing she bought last year because it makes the must-detested chore of cleaning her shower less of a pain. It's an electric spin scrubber that comes with multiple cleaning heads so you can use it on your countertops, sinks, tubs and showers and more. It also has an adjustable arm so you can reach tough spots in hard-to-reach places, and it convenient recharges via USB-C.\nAmazon Echo Buds with Active Noise Cancellation for $45 ($95 off with Prime): These buds are a bit old at this point, as they came out in 2021, but the 68 percent discount could be compelling. In our review, we said the buds were much improved over the last generation. They're more comfortable and have a better sound quality. Plus the Alexa integration makes them a decent pick for those who've gone all-in on Amazon's ecosystem. \nRing Pan-Tilt Indoor Cam for $40 ($40 off with Prime): This indoor security camera can spin 360 degrees and has a tilt range of 169 degrees so you can keep tabs on pets and other happenings at home. It'll let you drop in for a live view from your phone, and supports two-way talk for telling your pup to get off the couch.\nUGreen Revodok Pro 109 USB-C Hub for $32 ($22 off): The top pick in our guide to the best USB-C hubs has a good array of ports, including an HDMI 2.0 connection that supports 4K monitors at 60Hz, plus three USB-A ports, Ethernet and one USB-C (plus another for delivering 90W of power to your device. The hub has gone as low as $30 in prior sales. \nAmazfit Band 7 fitness tracker for $38 ($12 off with Prime): The runner up in our guide to the best, cheap fitness trackers has a comfortable design we found easy to sleep with and a great, mutli-week battery life. The screen isn’t as bright and it wasn’t quite as speedy as our top pick, but it does let you easily set custom goals.\nHamilton Beach Digital Programmable Rice Cooker for $40 ($10 off with Prime): Our top pick for a budget rice cooker is on sale for Prime members. The brown rice came out particularly good in our tests and the cooker is easy to clean with a dishwasher-safe cooker pot and steamer basket. Just note that it’s pretty small and doesn’t have the granular controls of pricer models.  \n-> See more kitchen tech Prime day deals in our guide. \nExpired deals\nBlink Outdoor 4 for $45 ($55 off): We named this outdoor camera the best for Alexa homes in our security cameras guide. It can go just about anywhere you want as the wireless design runs on AA batteries and can last for two years before needing to be replaced. The motion alerts are accurate, but keep in mind you’ll need a subscription to enable person detection and cloud storage.\nAmazon Echo Buds for $15 (70 percent off with Prime): In our guide to the best budget earbuds, we called Amazon’s latest earbuds the best option for an open-ear design. That means they don’t go all the way in your ear canal, which is far more comfortable for some people. They’re sturdy, comfortable and the sound is decent once you’ve fiddled with the EQ settings to bring down the treble. This is a lightning deal and the lowest price we've seen yet.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-amazon-prime-day-deals-under-50-save-on-gear-from-samsung-blink-anker-and-others-160028991.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Update 7/9/25: We're tracking all of the best Prime Day deals to come out of Day 2 of the sale here.\n\nAmazon Prime Day 2025 is here, so Prime members can finally take advantage of the long-awaited discounts across Amazon’s site. The online retailer has hosted its main, annual shopping event in July (almost) without fail for a decade, and it typically brings some of the best prices of the year to clothing, household goods, and yes, even consumer electronics. \nThis year is no different — a number of our top picks for the best tech you can buy right now have been discounted for Prime Day. Most Prime Day deals are exclusively available to Prime members, but there are always a few stragglers that anyone with an Amazon account can get. We’ve gathered the best Prime Day deals on tech that we could find here. We’ll be updating this post regularly throughout the duration of Prime Day, so check back to see the latest discounts.\nPrime Day deals: Engadget's top picks\nApple AirPods Pro 2 for $149 (40 percent off): The AirPods Pro 2 remain Apple’s best set of wireless earbuds, as they offer the full set of Apple-focused features, strong ANC, onboard volume controls, a comfy in-ear design and a warm sound profile that most should find agreeable. They can even work as a hearing aid now.\nSamsung SmartTag 2 for $15.50 (48 percent off): Samsung users looking to keep track of their stuff need look no further than the SmartTag 2. One of our top picks for the best Bluetooth trackers, this accessory easily attaches to keys, bags and other items and uses Samsung's large finding network to show you their last known location.\nLeebein Electric Spin Scrubber for $38 (46 percent off): This was my favorite thing I bought last year because it makes the must-detested chore of cleaning my shower less of a pain. It's an electric spin scrubber that comes with multiple cleaning heads so you can use it on your countertops, sinks, tubs and showers and more. It also has an adjustable arm so you can reach tough spots in hard-to-reach places, and it convenient recharges via USB-C.\nDyson V15 Detect Plus for $570 ($180 off): You can't get much better than a Dyson if you're on the market for a cordless stick vacuum, and the V15 Detect delivers. It's our current top pick for the best cordless vacuum overall thanks to its excellent suction power, lightweight design, good battery life and the included Fluffy Optic cleaning head that uses a laser to show you where all the debris is while you're using it.\niRobot Roomba Vacuum and Mop Combo for $140 (49 percent off): A version of one of our top favorite robot vacuums, this budget-friendly machine comes with a water reservoir that allows it to mop hard floors. It connects via Wi-Fi to the iRobot app as well, which lets you set cleaning schedules and further control the machine.\nNintendo Switch 2 + Mario Kart World bundle for $500: We'd be remiss if we didn't mention the fact that Amazon has the Nintendo Switch 2 available to order \"by invitation\" now. The Mario Kart World bundle is listed at the standard $500 price, so it's not a Prime Day deal per se, but considering Amazon was (supposedly) shut out of the initial Switch 2 order process earlier this year, it's notable to see the console listed on the site at all.\nPrime Day deals under $50\n\n\nJisulife Life7 handheld fan for $23 (21 percent off): Jisulife makes handheld fans we've recommended in past gift guides and this is one of its newer models. It can be held, folded so it sits flat on a table or worn around your neck for a cool breeze wherever you're going. It has an easy-to-read display in its center that will show you the fan speed level or current battery life, and its 5,000 mAh battery can last up to 19.5 hours on a single charge when you're running the fan on its lowest setting.\nAmazon Echo Spot for $45 (44 percent off): Amazon revived the Spot smart alarm clock last year, which features a half-circle shaped display that shows the time, weather and other information like song titles when you're using the speaker to play music. It has a compact design that will make it easy to fit on a desk or a nightstand, and as with any Alexa smart speaker, you can use it to control IoT devices like smart lights, locks and more.\nAmazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max for $35 ($25 off): This stick handles Dolby Vision, Dolby Atmos, 4K video and HDR10+ and supports Wi-Fi 6E. It has the fastest processor of any Fire TV Stick and Engadget’s Jeff Dunn has gotten a lot of use from the stick as a retro gaming emulator. Of course, Amazon’s user interface is less elegant (and less democratic) than others. And it highly prioritizes Prime Video content.\nAudible Premium Plus (three months) for $3 ($42 off): New subscribers can get three months of Audible for only $3, which represents a $42 discount. The Premium Plus tier gives you one book credit per month to use on any audiobook the service has, and you can stream any of the included titles for free on top of that. Audible also has members-only sales and discounts that you'll be able to take advantage of, too. The deal runs through July 31.\nPrime Day Apple deals\n\n\nApple iPad (A16) for $280 (20 percent off): The latest base model iPad comes with a faster A16 chip, 2GB more RAM and 128GB of storage as standard. It earned a score of 84 in our review — if you only need an iPad for roaming the internet, watching shows and doing some lighter productivity tasks, it's a good starter tablet.\nApple Watch Series 10 for $280 ($120 off): We consider Apple’s flagship wearable to be the best smartwatch you can buy, period. It's a mostly iterative update, with faster charging, a slightly slimmer design and a marginally larger display than the prior Series 9. That said, it's still a comprehensive fitness tracker, and no other smartwatch can integrate as neatly with iPhones and other Apple devices.\nAirPods Max (USB-C) for $399 (27 percent off): If you’re looking for over-ear headphones with all of the conveniences of in-ear AirPods, the AirPods Max are one of your only options (with the others being Beats devices). The latest models have the same design as the originals, but now charge up via USB-C instead of Lightning.\nPrime Day laptop deals\n\n\nMicrosoft Surface Laptop (13.8-inch, Snapdragon X Plus) for $880 (27 percent off): In addition to running on a Snapdragon X Plus processor, this 2024 Surface Laptop has 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD. It's a Copilot+ PC that also has a 13.8-inch touchscreen, and it should last up to 20 hours on a single charge.\nGoogle Pixelbook Go (13-inch, Intel Core M3) for $319 (51 percent off): The Pixelbook Go is a bit old at this point, but if you're a Chrome OS lover and want a Google-made laptop, this is a solid option. It includes an Intel Core M3 processor, 8GB of RAM, 64GB of storage and a 12-hour battery life.\nPrime Day tech deals\n\n\nDJI Neo drone for $159 (20 percent off): The DJI Neo may be an inexpensive, beginner-friendly drone, but has powerful features like subject tracking and quick shots. It can shoot video at up to 4K 30 fps and is quick and maneuverable, though it's also fairly loud. You can also grab one with three batteries and a charger for $229 (21 percent off).\nBose QuietComfort headphones for $199 (42 percent off):design is slightly dated, the Bose QuietComfort headphones provide stellar noise cancellation and will sit comfortably on your head for hours on end. These cans have up to 24 hours of battery life and support for multi-device connectivity as well.\nSony WH-1000XM5 headphones for $298 (25 percent off): While the XM6 headphones are the latest and greatest, they only make small changes to the already stellar XM5. These were our top pick for the best wireless headphones for a long time before the XM6 launched earlier this year, and we still like them for their excellent sound quality, strong ANC, multi-device connectivity and good battery life.\nKindle for $85 ($25 off): Our favorite budget option in our guide to the best ereaders, the latest base Kindle has 16GB of storage — more than enough to hold hundreds of books at a time. It has a compact and durable design that’s easy to take anywhere, and the latest model is faster than before with speedy page turns and a more seamless navigation between books, your library and other parts of the UI.\nSonos Beam Gen 2 for $369 (26 percent off): The second-gen Beam soundbar has support for Dolby Atmos and it has a relatively streamlined design that should be easy to fit into most home entertainment setups.\nInstant Pot Duo Plus 9-in-1 multicooker for $70 (50 percent off): This six-quart pressure cooker and multicooker is a versatile kitchen tool for anyone who (somehow) didn't buy into the Instant Pot craze a few years back. It can do a lot with its nine cooking modes, including pressure cook, slow cook, steam, rice cook, saute and more, and the six-quart size is great for families and meal-preppers.\nKindle Scribe for $260 ($140 off): The Scribe is one of the best E-Ink tablets you can buy at the moment, and certainly the top pick if you want a writable table that also excels as an ereader. It provides a great reading and writing experience, thanks in part to its ability to access the entire Kindle ebook library, and it has handy Google Drive, Microsoft OneDrive and Dropbox integration.\nNinja Dual-Zone air fryer (10 quart) for $180 ($50 off): This model is one of our favorite air fryers thanks to its dual-zone cooking system, which allows you to prepare two separate foods at different temperatures and settings. There's even a Match Cook feature that ensures both foods will be done at the same time, regardless of their cooking settings.\nLevoit Core 400S air purifier for $183 ($37 off): Our top pick for the best air purifier, Levoit's Core 400S reliably improved air quality in our testing, plus it has easy to use onboard controls and replaceable filters that are not too expensive. We also found it to not be offensively loud, even on its highest setting.\nTP-Link Deco XE75 Wi-Fi 6E mesh system for $200 (20 percent off): Our top pick for the best mesh Wi-Fi system, this Deco XE75 three-pack is easy to set up and provides excellent performance with no-frills. The Deco mobile app lets you check speeds for each node, and you can see all of the devices on your network at any time.\nRing Doorbell Battery + Indoor Cam 2 for $70 (50 percent off): If you're looking to build out a security system in your home, this bundle is a good place to start, giving you a video doorbell and an indoor security camera. You'll be able to see both live feeds in the Ring app, and they can send you motion alerts and let you speak to people on the other end of the camera when you're not at home.\nAmazon Fire TV Cube for $90 ($50 off): Amazon's most powerful streaming device, the Fire TV Cube can play 4K video with Dolby Vision and HDR10+, plus it supports Wi-Fi 6E and has a built-in Ethernet port for those who want a hardwired connection.\nAmazon 55-inch Omni mini-LED Fire smart TV for $700 ($120 off): A top-of-the-line model in the Fire TV family, this set has a 4K QLED mini-LED display with 1,400 nits of peak brightness and \"intelligence picture\" technology that adapts the screen to your room's lighting conditions. It also has a 144Hz refresh rate and support for AMD FreeSync.\nWhat is Prime Day?\nPrime Day is Amazon's members-only shopping event, which means you’ll have to be a Prime subscriber on Prime Day to take advantage of most of the savings. Amazon still offers a 30-day free trial to new Prime subscribers, so you can start your free trial closer to July and participate in the event.\nWhen is Prime Day 2025?\nAmazon Prime Day 2025 will be back this year on July 8 through July 11.\nHow often is Prime Day?\nAmazon Prime Day typically comes around annually in July. In the last few years, Amazon has also had its \"Big Deal Days\" in October, which is effectively a second Prime Day and the unofficial kickoff to the holiday shopping season.\nHow does Prime Day work?\nPrime subscribers can go to Amazon's site on Prime Day to see all of the exclusive deals they have access to. Prime subscribers do not have to do anything additional to get Prime Day sales: the discounts you see on product pages will show up in your cart automatically. If you're not a Prime subscriber and you go to Amazon to shop on Prime Day, you'll likely see tons of items on sale but only \"with Prime;\" those discounts will not be available to those who are not active Prime subscribers.\nIs Prime Day only for Prime members?\nTechnically yes, but even if you do not pay for a Prime membership, you should still check out Amazon on Prime Day. While most Prime Day deals will be exclusively available to subscribers, there are always a handful of sales available to all shoppers. Amazon distinguishes between them very clearly: you'll see \"Prime exclusive\" on product pages near the deal pricing on the discounts that are only available to paying members.\nSeparately, it’s very likely that other retailers like Walmart, Target and Best Buy will have their own competing Prime Day sales during that time frame, too. So if you're not keen on shopping at Amazon at all, it's worth checking out other retailers during the week of Prime Day to see if they are matching Prime Day deal prices.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/best-amazon-prime-day-2025-deals-our-top-picks-on-headphones-tvs-robot-vacuums-and-more-120028247.html?src=rss",

You may also think of unassuming items that could make a big difference in how you work and play while at school.

If the student in your life likes to work from the library or a coffee shop often, there’s a good chance they’ve had to do the charging dance, choosing which device is most crucial to them at the moment and giving it the prime spot on the wall. A surge protector power strip like this one from Anker can eliminate that problem by giving them eight AC outlets to use simultaneously, along with two USb-A ports and one USB-C connector. They’ll be able to charge up their laptop and phone at the same time, and have plenty of extra options if they also need to power a portable monitor or a tablet, or recharge a pair of headphones before they head home for the day. The USB-C port on this device also supports 20W fast-charging, which will be useful when they need to top up a dying smartphone. And with this power strip measuring just 4.5-inches by 3.6-inches, it’s compact enough to live in their backpack."

The joysticks feel smooth and accurate and the buttons are responsive.\nThis can run all of the software that the Quest 3 can run, so newcomers will have access to a robust catalog of games and experiences. The only major downside is that the 3s lacks a headphone jack, so folks will have to plug in a USB-C adapter for more immersive audio. I highly recommend doing this.

If you can handle the grotesque and gory themes throughout this show, it's an enthralling watch. The series follows sex columnist Carrie Bradshaw (Sarah Jessica Parker) and her friends in New York City. In season two, the drama heads to Seoul when Hendricks finds himself working on a mission with Korean intelligence. Ted Danson stars as Charles, a lonely widower whose wife died the year before after suffering from Alzheimer's. Andrew Scott plays the cunning Tom Ripley, a stylish con man who uses morally sketchy methods to get what he wants -- even murder. It follows high school chemistry teacher Walter White, who turns to cooking meth when he's diagnosed with cancer and worries about providing for his family.

    "summary": "These carrier security settings can prevent your phone number from being hijacked or stolen.",
    "full_text": "It’s 2025, and cell phone numbers are ubiquitous. With your phone number, a hacker can start gaining access to your online accounts, and even trick automated systems into thinking they are you when calling customer service. A hijacked phone number can sometimes be used to access a company’s network as if they were that employee, allowing access to sensitive files and data. This hacker would use information they found online, such as a customer’s name and date of birth, and then ask a customer support representative to transfer or “port out” that number to a different SIM card or carrier. As soon as that process completes, the person’s phone number will activate on a SIM card or phone controlled by the hacker, allowing them to make calls and send and receive text messages as if they were the person they just hacked. SIM swap attacks exploit a weakness in the security controls within a cell providers’ internal systems that let support representatives make changes to customer accounts without necessarily getting the customer’s express permission. Take a minute or two to check your phone carrier’s account; these features are often not publicized very well and may not be enabled by default. In July, AT&T introduced its free Wireless Account Lock security feature to help prevent SIM swaps. The feature allows AT&T customers to add extra account protection by toggling on a setting that prevents anyone from moving a SIM card or phone number to another device or account. Verizon says that switching off the feature may result in a 15-minute delay before any transactions can be performed — another safeguard to allow the legitimate account holder to reverse any account changes."

It has a very respectable 6.2-mile line-of-sight range and can fly at up to 18 mph, or 36 mph with a special controller.

    "summary": "It’s Amazon Prime Day again, except this time it’s a four-day affair, the longest Prime Day ever. There are an overwhelming number of deals and discounts to sift through, but this steep sale on Apple AirPods Pro 2 is one of the best out there. For Prime Day, these wireless, noise-canceling headphones are selling for $149. That's a new record-low price, and at a regular price of $249, you’re looking at 40 percent off.\nThe Apple AirPods Pro 2 were our overall pick for best wireless earbuds for iPhone, as well as our pick for best overall AirPods. In our hands-on review, we were impressed with the Active Noise Cancelling, as well as the transparency mode for when you’re trying to hear the outside world. We found that the audio quality on the 2nd generation of AirPods Pro was an improvement over the first, thanks to a new amplifier, driver and transducer. We also liked that you could seamlessly switch between Apple devices while using them. \n\n\nWe do wish the battery life was a bit better, as they offer just six hours of listening per charge with an additional 30 hours provided by the case. In looking at the design of these AirPods, we wouldn’t be mad at a bit of an update. I guess if it isn’t broke, don’t fix it? After all, the design of an AirPod is almost instantly recognizable, so perhaps Apple wants to keep it that way.\nFar and away our biggest gripe is the price of the Apple AirPods Pro. $249 is a hefty price to pay for a set of earbuds, so we’re grateful that sales like Amazon Prime Day provide a great opportunity to snag a pair for far less. If you're looking to spend even less, both models of the AirPods 4 are also on sale for Prime Day. You can get the standard version for $89 or the model with active noise cancellation for $119.\n\n\n\n\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/apples-airpods-pro-2-are-cheaper-than-ever-thanks-to-this-prime-day-deal-135116566.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Aside from Black Friday, Prime Day is the time to buy Amazon devices. Since the shopping event began in July 2015 (yes, it's been that long already), Prime Day has been one of the most reliable days of the year to get a Kindle, Fire TV Stick or Echo speaker on sale for dirt-cheap prices. Sure, you can find them for less throughout the year, but if you pay the $139 annual premium for Prime, it’s in your best interest to wait until mid-July to grab Amazon-made gear. That’s still accurate this year, too — for the most part.\nBut not for the Echo Dot. Yes, it’s on sale this year for $32. But that discounted price offends me personally — and it should offend you, too. The humble little orb of a smart speaker got the short end of the stick for Prime Day 2025. For reference, the latest edition of the Echo Dot was $23 last July Prime Day, and $23 again during the Black Friday period in 2024.\nWhile a $9 difference may not seem like much, it’s a slap in the face for Prime subscribers who have come to expect the exclusive deals available to them during this arbitrary shopping event to be just as much of a perk of their membership as access to Prime Video, free two-day delivery and the like. It’s worse that Amazon devices are the usual suspects when it comes to Hella Good Deals on Prime Day. If the Prime Day deal on the Echo Dot sucks, that means we can’t reliably expect any of Amazon’s devices to be down to record-low prices during this event.\nThis, of course, matters not one bit to Amazon. Why the company decided to punish would-be Echo Dot purchasers this time around and not Kindle or Fire TV buyers will likely remain a mystery to us. But considering the uncertainty surrounding tariffs in the US and the steady flow of rising prices on tech as a direct result of that, one theory I have is that Amazon is testing its customers.\nIf Engadget's historical Prime Day data is anything to go on, the Echo Dot is an extremely popular purchase — and Amazon likely knows that. If enough customers OK this objectively bad deal by purchasing the Echo Dot at $32 a pop, that signals to Amazon that it can continue to offer bad discounts on its devices without repercussions. I hesitate to say the days of a $23 Echo Dot are totally behind us, but they could be depending on how things go this summer.\nThat said, the best alternative to the Echo Dot this Prime Day is the Echo Spot for $45. Amazon revived that smart alarm clock last year and, while I don’t think it will boot the Echo Dot out of the speaker lineup any time soon, there’s an argument for such a replacement considering Amazon now also has the ultra-cheap Echo Pop. Regardless, if you were hoping to buy an Echo Dot on discount during Prime Day, I recommend skipping it and opting for the Spot or the Pop instead.\nIn addition, here are some Prime Day deals that are actually worth your time and money that all come in at $32 or less:\n\nThis $23 handheld fan that has already saved me from melting this year in the New York City summer heat.\nThe $18 Amazon Fire TV Stick HD that we recently named our favorite budget streaming device.\nA $16 Samsung Galaxy SmartTag 2, a favorite Bluetooth tracker of ours if you're a Samsung fan but also have a habit of losing things like your wallet or keys.\nA $20 AirTag, if you're also prone to losing things but identify as an iOS stan.\nThis $14 Anker wireless charging stand that's super basic, gets the job done and lets you power up your phone in either portrait or landscape mode.\nThis $19 Soundcore speaker that's a little larger than palm-sized and sounds pretty decent for its size.\nThese $22 Kasa smart bulbs that are hard to beat if you're looking for no-brainer IoT devices to start your smart home ecosystem.\nThis $13 Anker USB-C charging adapter because, if you're like me, you need to have one of these in basically every room so you can always charge your phone.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/you-absolutely-should-not-buy-an-echo-dot-on-prime-day-113023843.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "If you want to read more and stare at your phone less, an ereader can help. So for this guide, we found the best Prime Day Kindle deals — plus a couple of deals on non-Kindle ereaders like Kobo and Boox. Engadget editors and reporters have tested nearly every current-model Kindle and our reviews are linked below. Or check out our buying guide to ereaders for background on how to get the most out of your device. Amazon is also offering a discount on Unlimited subscriptions that grant access to thousands of ebooks. Here are the best Prime Day Kindle deals we could find.\n\n\nBest Prime Day deals on Kindle ereaders\n\n\nAmazon Kindle for $85 ($25 off with Prime): The base model Kindle is our recommendation for the best budget ereader. Even when it’s not on sale, it’s the most affordable e-book device from a major manufacturer. It’s compact and durable making it easy to carry. It doesn’t have warm LEDs and it’s not waterproof but it’s the most affordable way to access Amazon’s vast e-book ecosystem. \nKindle case (fabric) for $24 (25 percent off with Prime): If you want to protect your new ereader, you can grab this case while it's 25 percent off. Note that only the blue and pink versions are $24, the black and matcha versions are $2 more expensive. \nKindle Colorsoft for $180 ($100 off with Prime): Amazon didn’t introduce color to its ereader lineup until early this year — long after Kobo and Boox. The list price of $280 makes it more expensive than other color display ereaders, but this discount helps with that. We appreciate the fast page turns, pinch to zoom feature and auto-adjusting warm front light.\nKindle Scribe 2 for $260 ($140 off with Prime): If you want a Kindle that lets you write as well as read, this is the one to get. We gave the Kindle Scribe 2 a score of 86 in our review and it’s our pick for the best e-reader E Ink tablet. It has a smooth reading and writing experience with low latency. It also lets you create multiple notebooks, add pages and change the templates easily.\nKindle Paperwhite for $125 ($35 off with Prime): The Paperwhite is an elevated version of the Kindle, with a larger, seven-inch, flush-front screen and an adjustable warm front light. A faster processor gives it quicker page turns than its predecessor and the device itself is waterproof.\nKindle Paperwhite Signature Edition for $150 ($50 off with Prime): The Signature Edition adds few more premium features to the Kindle Paperwhite with wireless charging, an auto-adjusting front light and more storage (32GB). We gave it an 85 in our review praising the premium build, remarkably clear text and fast page turns. We just wish the power button wasn’t on the bottom.\nKindle Kids for $95 ($35 off with Prime): The Kindle Kids edition is the same hardware as the standard Kindle, but you get a few added perks that are fitting for younger users. To start, a case comes standard. The warranty is extended to two years. And the purchase price includes a six month subscription to Amazon Kids+ for thousands of kid-friendly ebooks and more.\nKindle Paperwhite Kids for $130 ($50 off with Prime): Again, the kids version is the same as the Paperwhite but with a cover, extended warranty and access to Amazon Kids+ for six months. Just remember to cancel at the end of the trial or keep it and pay $6 per month.\nBest Prime Day deals on non-Kindle ereaders\nBoox Palma 2 for $270 ($30 off): This smartphone-shaped device is a delight. It’s built on Android and can run just about any app you can download from the Play Store — just don’t expect it to play video or graphics-intensive games. This is an E Ink screen, after all. But it’s perfect for reading books and running simple apps in a more eye-friendly format.\nKobo Libra Color for $210 ($40 off): Our favorite ereader with buttons has a premium, waterproof build that’s very comfortable to hold. The touch controls and buttons are responsive and deeply customizable. The color display brings more life to book covers and graphic novels, and it’s even stylus-enabled if you want to scribble on your books. This is the lowest price in a few months, but note that it dropped to $200 in January.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-prime-day-kindle-deals-and-ereader-sales-080957865.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "If you’re considering updating your kitchen setup, first check out the best Prime Day kitchen deals we could find from Amazon’s sale. Engadget editors and reporters have tested and reviewed a whole bunch of kitchen tech and Amazon’s annual July sale is a great time to save on many of the gadgets we recommend. Right now, we’re seeing discounts on Ninja air fryers, Kitchen Aid appliances, Anova sous vide machines and even some indoor pizza ovens. And we’ve linked to our testing so you can get some background before diving in. Here are the best deals on kitchen tech in Amazon’s Prime Day sale.\nEditor's note: We've been anxiously waiting to see if Ninja's Creami ice cream maker would go on sale. Right now, a bundle with extra containers is selling for $200, but that's still well above the low of $160 we saw as recently as January. We'll continue to monitor the sale and will update this guide if the price goes lower.  \nPrime Day air fryer deals\n\n\nBreville Smart Oven Air Fryer Pro for $320 ($80 off): This is the premium pick in our air fryer guide — but really, it does far more than just air fry. As our reviewer noted, its massive cubic-foot-capacity and numerous cook modes make this more like an auxiliary oven. (It can even cook an entire 14-pound turkey.) It went on sale for $300 during last year's Black Friday sales. \nNinja Foodie Dual Zone Air Fryer (10 QT) for $180 ($70 off): This is the air fryer to pick if you’ve ever wished you could air fry two different things at the same time. We named it the best dual-zone air fryer you can get — it even has a feature that makes sure the two different foods are ready at the same time.\nInstant Vortex Plus Air Fryer (6 QT) for $100 ($70 off): After studious testing (and dutiful eating) our reviewers named this one the best air fryer you can buy. And, after reading that assessment, I bought one myself so I can verify this is one great machine. The Odor Ease tech really does keep the cooking smells at bay and the window lets me keep an eye on all the crisping that’s going on in there.\nInstant Pot Vortex Plus Air Fryer (4QT) for $65 ($65 off with Prime): Here’s a smaller version of the Instant air fryer we named best overall. It has a four-quart capacity, which is perfect for one person and small kitchens. And, like its larger sibling, pre-heats quickly.\nNinja Air Fryer (4 QT) for $80 ($50 off): The budget pick from our air fryer guide isn’t currently on sale, but this four-quart Ninja fryer has twice the capacity and is nearly the same price. It can also roast and dehydrate in addition to air frying and reheating.\nCheck out our guide to air fryers to read our testing results.\nPrime Day Instant Pot and rice cooker deals\n\n\nCuckoo Twin Pressure Rice Cooker for $190 ($70 off with Prime): This is the best premium rice cooker in our guide to those machines. We like how quickly it cooks all types of rice to perfection (we tested it with long-grain white basmati, brown and sushi-grade white rice). Just keep in mind that it can be a little difficult to clean and the manual isn’t the most user-friendly.\nHamilton Beach Digital Programmable Rice Cooker for $40 ($10 off with Prime): Our top pick for a budget rice cooker is on sale for Prime members. The brown rice came out particularly good in our tests and the cooker is easy to clean with a dishwasher-safe cooker pot and steamer basket. Just note that it’s pretty small and doesn’t have the granular controls of pricer models.\nPrime Day kitchen tech deals\n\n\nNinja CREAMi Ice Cream Maker (bundle) for $200 ($30 off): We said this machine “makes your frozen dreams come true.” It’s easy to use and makes thick, dense ice cream with flavors that are more intense and textures that are smoother than rival ice cream makers. Plus most of the parts are machine washable or easily rinsed. This bundle comes with extra containers and is the lowest price we’ve seen in a few months, but note that the Creami sold for $160 as recently as January.\nBreville Joule Turbo Sous Vide Machine for $200 ($50 off): The premium pick in our guide to sous vice machines has a powerful 1,100-watt heater that cuts down on cooking times. It also uses your phone as the controller (just don’t get it if you’re hoping for on-device buttons).\nAnova Sous Vide Cooker 3.0 for $139 (40 percent off): Our top pick for a sous vide machine delivers 1,100 watts of power and a flow rate of eight liters per minute which will get your water up to the right temperature faster. It also has intuitive digital touch controls and Wi-Fi connectivity.\nBreville Juice Fountain Plus for $120 ($60 off with Prime): The extraction abilities on this machine are impressive. Plus we found it relatively easy to clean (as long as you do it right after you juice). It takes up a good amount of space, but can extract an impressive amount of juice from even the driest-seeming carrot. This is the lowest price in a while, but it went down to $110 in January.\nVitamix E310 Explorian Blender for $330 ($50 off): Note that we've seen this go for as little as $255 in past sales, and it dropped to $300 as recently as May. But this is still a decent $50 discount on a blender that will make any food you put in it smooth. We recommend it in our guide to the best kitchen tech.  \nKitchenAid Classic Series (4.5 QT) for $300 ($50 off): Prime Day and Black Friday sales are usually the best times to snag Kitchen Aid’s iconic mixers — unfortunately, this discount isn’t even as good as the $250 it sold for in May. Still you can save $50 on a classic appliance that we recommend in our guide to essential kitchen gadgets.

In iOS 26, turn on the Adaptive Power option to help extend battery life. Since Adaptive Power appears to be using AI in deciding which settings and processes to adjust, I suspect the feature will be available on iPhone models that support Apple Intelligence, which include the iPhone 15 Pro and later. A Reddit thread about Adaptive Power suggests this is the case, with commenters noting it does not show up in iPhone 13 Pro or iPhone 14 Pro models with the beta installed. Adaptive Power sounds like an outgrowth of Gaming Mode, introduced in iOS 18, which routes all available processing and graphics power to the frontmost app and pauses other processes in order to deliver the best experience possible -- at the notable expense of battery life. \"When your battery usage is higher than usual\" could include a limited number of situations. I also wonder whether slightly adjusting display brightness could be disruptive."

    "summary": "Finding the best smart scale isn't just about tracking your weight anymore. Today’s smart bathroom scales do much more than older analog or digital models — they can give you detailed body composition measurements, track trends over time and sync effortlessly with health apps on your phone. Whether you're starting a new fitness routine or just want to stay informed about your health, a good weight scale can be a surprisingly useful tool.Many of the top models now include sleek features like color displays and multiple user profiles, and track metrics like BMI, muscle mass and heart rate. Some even double as a body fat scale, giving you a broader picture of your overall wellness. In this guide, we’ve tested and reviewed several options to help you find your top pick — from budget-friendly basics to more advanced connected scales that fit seamlessly into your daily routine.\nTable of contents\n\nSmart scale safety\nBest smart scales for 2025\nWhat to look for in a smart scale\nHow we tested and which smart scales we tested\nSmart scales FAQs\n\nSmart scale safety\nThere are valid reasons to weigh yourself but your self-worth shouldn’t be defined by what number shows up between your feet. If you’re looking to alter your body shape, that figure could go up as your waistline goes down since muscle weighs more than fat. \nSome scales go further by providing additional metrics like visceral fat levels, giving you a more comprehensive picture of your health. Dr. Anne Swift, Director of Public Health teaching at the University of Cambridge, said “weighing yourself too often can result in [you] becoming fixated on small fluctuations day-to-day rather than the overall trend over time.” Swift added “it’s sometimes better to focus on how clothes fit, or how you feel, rather than your weight.”\nA meta-analysis from 2016 found there may be some negative psychological impact from self weighing. A 2018 study, however, said there may be a positive correlation between regular weigh-ins and accelerated weight loss. It can be a minefield and I’d urge you to take real care of yourself and remember success won’t happen overnight.\nBest smart scales for 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat to look for in a smart scale\nWeight\nA scale that measures weight is probably the top requirement, right? Whether you're after a basic weight scale or a full-featured body fat scale, bear in mind, with all these measurements, the readings won’t be as accurate as a calibrated clinical scale. It’s better to focus on the overall trend, up or down over time, rather than a single measurement in isolation. Scales offering high-precision measurements can help, especially if you’re looking at the data to inform a specific health or fitness goal.\nConnectivity\nBefore you buy your scale, work out how you’re planning on weighing yourself and when, as it is an issue. Some lower-end smart bathroom scales connect via Bluetooth and have no internal storage, so if you don’t have your phone to hand, it won’t record your weight. If your scale has Wi-Fi, then your scale can post the data to a server, letting you access them from any compatible device. Also, you should be mindful that some smart scales aren’t built with security in mind, so there’s a small risk to your privacy should your scale be compromised.\nBone density\nThe stronger your bones are, the less risk you have of breaks and osteoporosis — common concerns as you get older. Clinical bone density tests use low-power x-rays and some scales can offer you an at-home approximation. These bone mass tests pass a small electrical current through your feet, measuring the resistance as it completes its journey. The resistance offered by bones, fat and muscle are all different, letting your scale identify the difference. A body composition monitor often includes this feature, too, providing a detailed breakdown of bone density, fat and muscle mass.\nBody fat percentage and muscle mass\nFat and muscle are necessary parts of our makeup, but too much of either can be problematic. Much like bone density, a body composition measurement feature can monitor your body fat and muscle mass percentages using Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis (BIA). This measurement tests how well your body resists an electrical signal passing through your body. (It’s a rough rule of thumb you should have a 30/70 percent split between fat and muscle, but please consult a medical professional for figures specific to your own body and medical needs.) For those with specific athletic goals, smart scales offer an athlete mode to better tailor readings for accuracy. If body fat monitoring is a priority, look for a model marketed as a body fat scale.\nBMI\nA lot of scales offer a BMI calculation, and it’s easy to do since you just plot height and weight on a set graph line. Body Mass Index is, however, a problematic measurement that its critics say is both overly simplistic and often greatly misleading. Unfortunately, it’s also one of the most common clinical body metrics and medical professionals will use it to make judgements about your care.\nPulse Wave Velocity\nFrench health-tech company Withings has offered Pulse Wave Velocity (PWV) on its flagship scale for some time, although regulatory concerns meant it was withdrawn for a period. It’s a measurement of arterial stiffness, which acts as a marker both of cardiovascular risk and other health conditions. For those looking for an even deeper understanding of their health, some scales now offer a body scan, which provides more advanced metrics such as segmental body composition and vascular health insights.\nWearables and integration\nPairing your smart scale with wearables like fitness trackers or smartwatches can further enhance your health-tracking ecosystem. Many smart scales sync directly with platforms like Fitbit or Apple Health, making it easier to track trends and analyze your data in one place.\nDisplay\nLess a specification and more a note: Smart bathroom scales have displays ranging from pre-printed LCDs or digital dot matrix layouts through to color display screens. On the high end, your scale display can show you trending charts for your weight and other vital statistics, and can even tell you the day’s weather. If you are short-sighted, and plan on weighing yourself first thing in the morning, before you’ve found your glasses or contacts, opt for a big, clear, high-contrast display.\nApp and subscriptions\nYou’ll spend most of your time looking at your health data through its companion scales app, and it’s vital you get a good one. This includes a clear, clean layout with powerful tools to visualize your progress and analyze your data to look for places you can improve. Given that you often don’t need to buy anything before trying the app, it’s worth testing one or two to see if you vibe with it. It’s also important you check app compatibility before making your purchase. Some health apps will only work with iOS or Android — not both. Apple Watch connectivity can also be a bonus for tracking workouts and health metrics seamlessly. Several companies also offer premium subscriptions, unlocking other features – including insights and coaching – to go along with your hardware.\nData portability\nUsing the same scale or app platform for years at a time means you’ll build up a massive trove of personal data. And it is (or should be), your right to take that data to another provider if you choose to move platforms in the future. Data portability is, however, a minefield, with different platforms offering wildly different options, making it easy (or hard) to go elsewhere.\nAll of the devices in this round-up will allow you to export your data to a .CSV file, which you can then do with as you wish. Importing this information is trickier, with Withings and Garmin allowing it, and Omron, Xiaomi, Eufy and Fitbit not making it that easy. (Apps that engage with Apple Health, meanwhile, can output all of your health data in a .XML file.)\nPower\nIt’s not a huge issue but one worth bearing in mind that each scale will either run disposable batteries (most commonly 4xAAA) or with its own, built-in battery pack. Either choice adds an environmental and financial cost to your scale’s life — either with regular purchases of fresh cells or the potential for the whole unit to become waste when the battery pack fails.\nHow we tested and which smart scales we tested\nFor this guide, I tested six scales from major manufacturers:\nMi (Xiaomi) Body Composition Scale 2\nOur cheapest model, Xiaomi / Mi’s Body Composition Scale 2 is as bare-bones as you can get, and it shows. It often takes a long while to lock on to get your body weight, and when it does you’ll have to delve into the Zepp Life-branded scales app in order to look at your extra data. But you can’t fault it for the basics, offering limited (but accurate) weight measurements and body composition for less than the price of a McDonald’s for four.\nFitbit Aira Air\nFitbit, now part of Google, is the household name for fitness trackers and smartwatches in the US, right? If not, then it must be at least halfway synonymous with it. The Aria Air is the company’s stripped-to-the-bare bones scale, offering your weight and a few other health metrics, but you can trust that Fitbit got the basics right. Not to mention that most of the reason for buying a Fitbit product is to leverage its fitness app anyway.\nAnker Eufy Smart Scale P2 Pro\nEufy’s Smart Scale P2 Pro has plenty of things to commend it – the price, the overall look and feel (it’s a snazzy piece of kit) and what it offers. It offers a whole host of in-depth functionality, including Body Fat, Muscle Mass, Water Weight, Body Fat Mass and Bone Mass measurements, as well as calculating things like your Heart Rate and Basal Metabolic Rate (the amount of calories you need to eat a day to not change weight at all) all from inside its app. In fact, buried beneath the friendly graphic, the scale offers a big pile of stats and data that should, I think, give you more than a little coaching on how to improve your overall health.\nIt’s worth noting that Anker – Eufy’s parent company – was identified as having misled users, and the media, about the security of its products a few years back. Its Eufy-branded security cameras, which the company says does not broadcast video outside of your local network, was found to be allowing third parties to access streams online. Consequently, while we have praised the Eufy Smart Scale for its own features, we cannot recommend it without a big caveat.\nOmron BCM-500 Body Composition and Scale with Bluetooth\nGiven its role in making actual medical devices, you know what you’re getting with an Omron product. A solid, reliable, sturdy, strong (checks the dictionary for more synonyms) dependable piece of kit. There’s no romance or excitement on show, but you can trust that however joyless it may be, it’ll do the job in question and will be user-friendly. The hardware is limited, the app is limited, but it certainly (checks synonyms again) is steady.\nJoking aside, Omron’s Connect app is as bare-bones as you can get, since it acts as an interface for so many of its products. Scroll over to the Weight page, and you’ll get your weight and BMI reading, and if you’ve set a fitness goal, you can see how far you’ve got to go to reach it. You can also switch to seeing a trend graph which, again, offers the most basic visualization of your workouts and progress.\nGarmin Index S2\nGarmin’s got a pretty massive fitness ecosystem of its own, so if you’re already part of that world, its smart scale is a no-brainer. On one hand, the scale is one of the easiest to use, and most luxurious of the bunch, with its color screen and sleek design. I’m also a big fan of the wealth of data and different metrics the scale throws at you – you can see a full color graph charting your weight measurements and goal progress, and the various metrics it tracks in good detail. If there’s a downside, it’s that Garmin’s setup won’t hold your hand, since it’s for serious fitness people, not newbies.\nWithings Body Comp\nAt the highest end, Withings’ flagship Body Comp is luxurious, and luxuriously priced, a figure I’d consider to be “too much” to spend on a bathroom scale. For your money, however, you’ll get a fairly comprehensive rundown of body composition metrics including your weight, body fat percentage, vascular age, pulse wave velocity and electrodermal activity. Its monochrome dot matrix display may not be as swish as the Garmin’s, but it refreshes pretty quickly and feels very in-keeping with the hardware’s overall sleek look.\nWithings Body Scan\nIf you want to flaunt your cash, you don’t buy a car, you buy a supercar, or a hypercar if you’re flush enough. What then, do we call Withings’ $400 Body Scan if not a super-smart scale, or a hyper-smart scale? As well as doing everything the Body Comp does, plus running a six-lead ECG, segmented body composition, and will even check for neuropathy in your feet. It is the best scale I’ve ever used, it is also the most expensive, and I suspect it’s too much device for almost everyone who’d consider buying one.\nSmart scales FAQs\nWhat's the difference between a smart scale and a regular scale?\nA regular scale is pretty straightforward — it tells you how much you weigh, and that’s usually it. A smart scale, on the other hand, does much more. Not only does it give you your weight measurements, but it can also track things like your body fat percentage, muscle mass, and even your BMI. Some smart scales even monitor more advanced metrics like bone density, depending on the model.\nWhat’s even better is that smart scales sync with scales apps on your phone using Wi-Fi or Bluetooth, so you can see all your health data in one place. This lets you monitor trends over time, like if your muscle mass is increasing or your body fat percentage decreasing.\nHow do smart scales work with more than one person using it?\nWhen more than one person in a household uses the smart scale, it usually recognizes each person by their weight range and other body measurements (like body fat percentage). Most smart scales allow you to set up individual profiles in the companion app, and once your profile is linked, the scale can automatically figure out who’s standing on it.\nLet’s say you and a family member have fairly different weights — the scale will easily know who’s who based on that. But if you and someone else have similar weights, it might ask you to confirm the profile on your phone after the weigh-in. Some scales even let you assign a profile manually in the scales app if it’s not sure.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/best-smart-scale-160033523.html?src=rss",

Here's what I did at 10:30 p.m. the night before my digital detox. I could make or receive voice calls, but that was the extent of my allowed phone use. That morning, we got out a map of Albuquerque from an outdated 2002 road atlas. With no traffic alerts, we fled the highway and found an alternate way on old Route 66. The estate sale person offered to text us a map, which we declined. With no streaming, we turned to a classic method of accessing entertainment: an antenna. Instead, I reset my Ring camera's motion detection to reduce random alerts from cars and dog walkers. Instead of punching in Google queries on my phone, I figured things out."

The built-in Ambient Experience lets the dongle display art and widgets when you're not using your TV, not unlike Samsung's The Frame and The Frame Pro. The Fire TV Stick 4K Max can also stream games from Xbox Game Pass using the Xbox app or Amazon Luna.\nThe only real reasons to not consider Amazon's platform is if you don't like using Alexa, which acts as the main voice interface for all Fire TVs, don't want to be pushed towards Amazon's services or your subscriptions are tangled up in another platform. You can buy subscriptions to a variety of streaming services and live channels through Amazon Prime Video, but if you've already done that on Apple TV+ for example, you might want to wait out your subscription before jumping ship. \nThis is just one of a few Fire TV deals you can snag for Prime Day.

    "full_text": "For Ukrainian teams, this means not just funding but also support with setting up compliant entities in NATO countries like Estonia. Krattworks marked a turning point for Sass; it was also his last investment as an angel investor. Backing a fund like Darkstar makes SmartCap an exception as well, alongside Lithuania’s sovereign VC fund Coinvest Capital, which became authorized to make defense investments without requiring civilian use cases in 2023. For Darkstar, building that know-how meant talking to end users from day one. This can be hard to navigate for outsiders, but Sass got a head start. Although cheap first-person view (FPV) drones have been used to destroy equipment worth millions, Sass says that it would be a huge mistake to think that tech developments from Ukraine are easily copyable. Some of Darkstar’s deal flow will come from its bootcamps, where staff work hands-on with teams for five days. But the pipeline is broader, and Ukraine’s 2,000 eligible teams stand out. “Many of the Ukrainian companies we are looking at are not six months old; they have been around two-plus years and they have already managed to build a product and company with minimum capital.” Just as he once argued that “early-stage Nordic startups should cut the crap and move to Silicon Valley,” Darkstar won’t invest in companies that intend to stay based exclusively in Ukraine."

    "full_text": "Amazon Prime Day deal: The Noco Boost Sport GB20 portable jump starter is currently discounted by 15%, bringing its normal $65 price tag down to just $55 bucks. The GB20 packs enough cranking power for most passenger cars and small SUVs, but owners of big trucks, V8s or diesel-powered vehicles can also find Noco's larger GB40 jump starter discounted to $80 which is 36% off. That's why for years I've been recommending that drivers keep a small portable jump starter in their trunk or emergency kit to quickly get themselves restarted and back on the road. The Noco Boost is extremely small, not much larger than an airline-sized USB battery bank. Once you're up and running, disconnect the Noco Boost and toss it back into your emergency kit -- no worrying about crossed cables, no flagging down strangers for a jump. The Noco Boost can also be used to charge and power your phone or other small gadgets in a pinch thanks to its weather-sealed USB type-A port, which is a nice bonus if your emergency isn't a dead battery and you need to call for help. Marked down by 15% today, you can add it to your cart for just 55 bucks. Fortunately, Noco's entire line of vehicle power products is on sale. For trucks, I recommend the 1,000-amp Noco Boost GB40 which is discounted to $80 or 36% off its regular price. Finding a good portable jump starter is an easy way to add peace of mind to your or your loved one's trunk, especially if they drive an older car or have a habit of accidentally leaving their vehicle's lights on."

    "full_text": "LangChain, an AI infrastructure startup providing tools to build and monitor LLM-powered applications, is raising a new round of funding at an approximate $1 billion valuation led by IVP, according to three sources with knowledge of the deal. LangChain began its life in late 2022 as an open-source project founded by Harrison Chase, who was then an engineer at machine learning startup Robust Intelligence. After generating significant developer interest, Chase transformed the project into a startup, securing a $10 million seed round from Benchmark in April 2023. The startup’s open-source code solved those problems with a framework for building apps on top of LLM models. It became a hugely popular project on GitHub (111K stars, over 18,000 forks). This product has soared in popularity, multiple people tell us. Since its introduction last year, LangSmith has led the company to reach annual recurring revenue (ARR) between $12 million and $16 million, four sources told TechCrunch. The company didn’t respond to a request for comment. Developers can start working with LangSmith for free and upgrade to $39 per month for small team collaboration features, according to the company’s website.

This isn’t exactly new behavior for Grok, an X account operated by the platform itself, which users can tag in posts when they want the AI bot to answer their questions. Grok is powered by xAI, Musk’s AI company that recently merged with X. Musk blamed this on an “unauthorized modification.” Days later, Grok said it was skeptical of the widely substantiated fact that about 6 million Jews were killed in the Holocaust, noting that “numbers can be manipulated for political narratives.” Once again, xAI issued a statement that blamed Grok’s responses on an “unauthorized modification.” After Grok’s period of obsession with “white genocide,” xAI began publishing Grok’s system prompts — the high-level instructions that a developer gives to an LLM — as an act of accountability. In spite of Grok’s new updates, the AI chatbot returned to its antisemitic rants this week. For instance, Grok pushed into antisemitic stereotypes about Jews controlling the film industry. A remarkable case of candor, with Grok accurately reflecting its training data. But my quip was a neutral nod to patterns, not hate.” TechCrunch counted more than 100 posts from Grok using the phrase “every damn time” within an hour span."

If you want to use AI with your phone, its tools are baked into the heart of the phone experience without you needing to also activate and sign into a third-party service. Open the default camera app and you're met with a neat interface, comprised mostly of the shutter button and zoom levels, with other shooting modes found alongside. It doesn't try to overcomplicate things here, instead letting you quickly shoot images without messing about with settings. The camera's simple software makes it easy to take photos with little effort on your part. The Pixel does offer deeper control if you want it, conveniently hidden behind a small settings icon, rather than requiring you to switch completely into a \"Pro\" mode. For those of you wanting to take manual control of your white balance to warm up a beautiful sunset, the Pixel 9 Pro offers an easy way in. Google has clearly taken notes from Apple's approach in making the Pixel range. Apple's phones may be derided by Android fans for their lack of customization and \"locked down\" nature, but iPhones are famously more simple to operate."

Those same cameras act as the robot's eyes, scanning your pool for any dirt or particles that may be floating around so that it can mosey on over and clean it up. Beatbot's AquaSense has premium features and a best-in-class battery life. Should the bot miss a spot, Beatbot also has an app that lets you control it manually. CNET Deals texts are free, easy and can save you money. For instance, regular robot vacuum cleaners can also save you time by cleaning your hard floors and carpets. At a $930 discount, that brings it in line with less expensive pool cleaning robots that offer fewer features for the same amount of money. Factor in the time you save by not having to clean the pool all the time and the cost savings of having to bring someone out to clean it for you (or repair it due to lack of maintenance), and you could potentially earn this money back in pretty short order."

Most cards require you to spend a certain amount in the first few months of account ownership to \"earn\" a bonus, but the Prime Visa card doesn't. Amazon's flagship card is a great all-around rewards card, since it offers 5% back on travel booked through Chase and 2% back at gas stations, restaurants and rideshare services. You can also earn 7% back or more on eligible Amazon items from July 8 to 11 when you opt for no-rush delivery, and 10% back on select products. Checking out on Amazon is certainly convenient, but I also like to shop small. But this card only makes sense if you're a Prime member and regular Amazon shopper. It's not as rewarding but has no annual fee and comes with a $50 gift card on approval. For rates and fees of the Blue Cash Preferred Card from American Express, click here."

The DOJ said Xu worked for a company called Shanghai Powerock Network, which conducted hacking operations for the Chinese government. The alleged hackers are also accused of the mass hacks of Microsoft Exchange servers beginning in March 2021. The hackers, publicly referred to as a group called Hafnium, broke into more than 60,000 self-hosted Exchange servers run by mostly small businesses across the United States, allowing the theft of private company mailboxes and address books. Hafnium has since launched a new hacking campaign, dubbed Silk Typhoon, which researchers say is known for hacking into big companies and government agencies."

Mid-pile carpeting usually causes more problems for vacuums, but the Tineco A11’s solid battery life delivers up to 35 minutes of uninterrupted run time.The A11 series design looks nice and is functional, with a dustbin that's easy to completely empty. There's also a handy trigger lock lever to keep the vacuum running without constant finger pressure. It's also not one we recommended due to its subpar performance in most categories. Lubluelu 009 (Update: Currently Out of Stock): At a very budget-friendly $85, the Lubluelu 009 is an easy recommendation for those looking to save some cash and still get some cleaning done without dragging around a cord. The stick vac did a commendable job by picking up 96% (on average) of our test sand from hardwood. On low-pile carpets, that figure dropped to a very respectable 66.7%. Prosenic P11 Lite: The Prosenic P11 Lite was a cordless vacuum that would have earned a spot on our list if its performance for carpeted floors was as good as hardwood.

The reason it doesn't make our primary list is that at $1,500 MSRP and around $1,000 on sale, it's still a very expensive model compared to competitors that perform better for less. While there is a base station, there's no water tank included, which holds it back compared to cheaper options from Yeedi and others. Dreame X50 Ultra: The Dreame X50 Ultra is a robot vacuum we liked for its ability to get over obstacles as tall is 2.36 inches by deploying a pair of legs. Hardwood performance is OK at 62% sand pickup, but nothing special compared with other robot vacuums on our list, which can get as high as 90%.

Eufy Robovac 25C: You might not expect sufficient cleaning power from a budget-priced robot vacuum, but that's precisely what the Anker Eufy Robovac 25C delivers. For instance, its ability to scour sand from hardwood floors (78.9%) wasn't too far below some of our midrange robot vacuums. On low- and mid-pile carpets as well, the RoboVac 25C managed to suck up averages of 54% and 52% of sand from them, respectively."

    "full_text": "A new report estimates that AI will be a larger-than-ever part of the online shopping process during Amazon’s Prime Day sale, which began Tuesday morning. Amazon’s annual sale, which this year spans four days (July 8-11), is predicted to drive $23.8 billion in online spending across U.S. e-commerce retailers, as other businesses run their own competing sales alongside the popular shopping event. The firm’s analysis encompasses over 1 trillion visits to U.S. retail websites, including 100 million SKUs across 18 product categories. During the Prime Day event, Adobe estimates that traffic from generative AI sources will increase 3,200% year-over-year. This is still a much smaller source than other channels, like paid search and email, but Adobe believes it will continue to grow as consumers see the value in using AI for shopping. The company noted that GenAI-powered chatbots and browsers saw an initial surge in use during the 2024 holiday season, when traffic from those sources jumped 1,300% compared with the prior year from November 1 through December 31, 2024. Save $450 on your TechCrunch All Stage pass Build smarter. Of those who used GenAI, 92% said it enhanced their purchase experience, and 87% said they are more likely to use AI for larger or more complex purchases. AI providers have been capitalizing on this trend by integrating AI into shopping, as Google has with Gemini-enhanced product search and as OpenAI has with the addition of shopping features in ChatGPT, for example. Adobe’s forecast says that consumers this Prime Day will be focused on discounts, with apparel having the biggest deals."

Your goal is to find hidden words that fit the puzzle's theme. These are the words I used to get those hints but any words of four or more letters that you find will work: When you have all of them (I originally thought there were always eight but learned that the number can vary), every letter on the board will be used. #1: To get more clue words, see if you can tweak the words you've already found, by adding an \"S\" or other variants. And if you find a word like WILL, see if other letters are close enough to help you make SILL, or BILL. #2: Once you get one theme word, look at the puzzle to see if you can spot other related words."

The company’s strategy is to raise money via a fundraising round and separately hold a tender offer to allow employees to sell some of their shares to a select group of investors, anonymous sources told Bloomberg. SpaceX typically holds tender offers twice per year. SpaceX’s valuation has steadily climbed since the company was founded more than two decades ago. The company broke the $100 billion valuation mark in October 2021 and doubled that figure just three years later. This latest round would represent a major jump from the $350 billion valuation set during the tender offer held in December 2024. Discussions are still ongoing, and the deal, including the final price, could change."

The company had just launched that version of the game, also available on Game Pass, a subscription service that provides access to several games for a monthly fee. Several video game news outlets reported on the story and noted that several players complained on social media that they had been hacked while playing the game. Until now, there had not been a confirmed link between the two events. “The game is not safe to play on PC right now, there’s an RCE exploit,” a player wrote on Reddit last week, referring to a type of bug known as remote code execution, which allows hackers the ability to plant malware capable of essentially taking control of a victim’s device. Activision did not respond to multiple requests for comment. Contact Us Do you have more information about these hacks? In the last couple of years, Activision has had to deal with several hacking incidents. In November 2024, a hacker found a flaw in Call of Duty’s anti-cheat system that allowed them to ban thousands of legitimate gamers. In 2023, hackers used a self-spreading malware — a computer worm — to hack Call of Duty: Modern Warfare players, thanks to an unpatched years-old bug in the game."

The new “Manage subscriptions” tool is rolling out on the web, Android, and iOS in select countries. With the new feature, users can view and manage their subscription emails in one place and quickly unsubscribe from the ones they no longer want to receive. If a user decides to unsubscribe, Gmail will send an unsubscribe request to the sender on their behalf. “It can be easy to feel overwhelmed by the sheer volume of subscription emails clogging your inbox: Daily deal alerts that are basically spam, weekly newsletters from blogs you no longer read, promotional emails from retailers you haven’t shopped in years can quickly pile up,” Chris Doan, Gmail’s director of product, wrote in a blog post. Manage subscriptions joins Gmail’s other tools that are designed to declutter your inbox, such as the one-click unsubscribe tool that rolled out last year. The feature allows users to unsubscribe from emails using a simple “unsubscribe” button, getting rid of the need to navigate through websites or the bottom of emails when looking to unsubscribe from promotional and newsletter content.

Google says the new feature will begin rolling out on the web starting Tuesday, with Android and iOS users starting to receive it on July 14 and July 21, respectively.
