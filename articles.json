    "summary": "Elon Musk’s AI company, xAI, late on Wednesday released its latest flagship AI model, Grok 4, and unveiled a new $300-per-month AI subscription plan, SuperGrok Heavy. Grok is xAI’s answer to models like OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini, and can analyze images and respond to questions. In recent months, Grok has become more deeply integrated into Musk’s social […]",
    "full_text": "The latest AI model from xAI will be stacked up against OpenAI’s forthcoming AI model, GPT-5, which is expected to launch later this summer. The launch of Grok 4 comes amid a tumultuous week for Elon Musk’s companies. xAI had to briefly limit Grok’s account and delete the offensive posts. Save $450 on your TechCrunch All Stage pass Build smarter. xAI launched two models on Wednesday: Grok 4 and Grok 4 Heavy — the latter being the company’s “multi-agent version” that offers increased performance. The nonprofit Arc Prize says that Grok achieves a new state-of-the-art score on its ARC-AGI-2 test — another difficult benchmark that consists of puzzle-like problems where an AI has to identify visual patterns — scoring 16.2%. The launch of Grok 4 comes after a tumultuous week for Elon Musk’s social media and AI companies. Yaccarino’s departure comes just days after an automated X account connected to Grok responded to users with antisemitic comments criticizing Hollywood’s “Jewish executives” and praising Hitler. On Tuesday, Elon Musk’s AI company had to briefly limit Grok’s account from responding to users, and deleted the offensive posts. The company notes that xAI’s enterprise sector is only two months old, however, it plans to work with hyperscalers to make Grok available through their cloud platforms."

    "summary": "Amazon Prime Day is finally here, so now’s the time for members to stock up on discounted home essentials, clothing, shoes, and of course, tech. It’s safe to say that Amazon’s website will be overwhelming for the entirety of the event, so we wouldn’t blame you if you got distracted immediately upon opening it.\nIf you’ve got gadgets on your wishlist, Engadget has you covered. We’re surfacing the best Prime Day deals for day two on gadgets and gear we can find for the whole of the shopping event. As in years past, Prime Day has brought solid discounts on some of our favorite tech including earbuds, tablets, robot vacuums and home devices. These are the best Prime Day deals you can get right now. We’ll be updating this post regularly throughout the duration of Prime Day, so check back to see the latest discounts. \nPrime Day deals: Engadget's top picks\nApple AirPods Pro 2 for $149 (40 percent off): The AirPods Pro 2 remain Apple’s best set of wireless earbuds, as they offer the full set of Apple-focused features, strong ANC, onboard volume controls, a comfy in-ear design and a warm sound profile that most should find agreeable. They can even work as a hearing aid now.\nDJI Neo drone for $159 (20 percent off): The DJI Neo may be an inexpensive, beginner-friendly drone, but has powerful features like subject tracking and quick shots. It can shoot video at up to 4K 30 fps and is quick and maneuverable, though it's also fairly loud. You can also grab one with three batteries and a charger for $229 (21 percent off).\nLeebein Electric Spin Scrubber for $38 (46 percent off): This was my favorite thing I bought last year because it makes the must-detested chore of cleaning my shower less of a pain. It's an electric spin scrubber that comes with multiple cleaning heads so you can use it on your countertops, sinks, tubs and showers and more. It also has an adjustable arm so you can reach tough spots in hard-to-reach places, and it convenient recharges via USB-C.\nSamsung SmartTag 2 for $15.50 (48 percent off): Samsung users looking to keep track of their stuff need look no further than the SmartTag 2. One of our top picks for the best Bluetooth trackers, this accessory easily attaches to keys, bags and other items and uses Samsung's large finding network to show you their last known location.\niRobot Roomba Vacuum and Mop Combo for $140 (49 percent off): A version of one of our top favorite robot vacuums, this budget-friendly machine comes with a water reservoir that allows it to mop hard floors. It connects via Wi-Fi to the iRobot app as well, which lets you set cleaning schedules and further control the machine.\nNintendo Switch 2 + Mario Kart World bundle for $500: We'd be remiss if we didn't mention the fact that Amazon has the Nintendo Switch 2 available to order \"by invitation\" now. The Mario Kart World bundle is listed at the standard $500 price, so it's not a Prime Day deal per se, but considering Amazon was (supposedly) shut out of the initial Switch 2 order process earlier this year, it's notable to see the console listed on the site at all.\nPrime Day deals under $50\n\n\nSoundcore Select 4 for $19 (46 percent off): This 9.3-ounce speaker is a massive improvement over built-in smartphone audio. It can fill a room at a decent range of frequencies, and works well in room-sized outdoor spaces — plus, with IP67 waterproofing, it can survive a dip in the pool. It's currently almost half off.\nAnker iPhone Nano Power Bank with Built-in USB-C Connector for $20 ($10 off): One of these little guys could represent the difference between a dead phone and a not-dead phone. It’s the size of an oldey-timey lipstick case and delivers a partial charge to any USB-C phone. We tested it out and awarded it a spot in our guide to power banks.\nJisulife Life7 handheld fan for $23 (21 percent off): Jisulife makes handheld fans we've recommended in past gift guides and this is one of its newer models. It can be held, folded so it sits flat on a table or worn around your neck for a cool breeze wherever you're going. It has an easy-to-read display in its center that will show you the fan speed level or current battery life, and its 5,000 mAh battery can last up to 19.5 hours on a single charge when you're running the fan on its lowest setting.\nAmazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max for $35 ($25 off): This stick handles Dolby Vision, Dolby Atmos, 4K video and HDR10+ and supports Wi-Fi 6E. It has the fastest processor of any Fire TV Stick and Engadget’s Jeff Dunn has gotten a lot of use from the stick as a retro gaming emulator. Of course, Amazon’s user interface is less elegant (and less democratic) than others. And it highly prioritizes Prime Video content.\nAmazon Echo Spot for $45 (44 percent off): Amazon revived the Spot smart alarm clock last year, which features a half-circle shaped display that shows the time, weather and other information like song titles when you're using the speaker to play music. It has a compact design that will make it easy to fit on a desk or a nightstand, and as with any Alexa smart speaker, you can use it to control IoT devices like smart lights, locks and more.\nPrime Day Apple deals\n\n\nApple iPad (A16) for $280 (20 percent off): The latest base model iPad comes with a faster A16 chip, 2GB more RAM and 128GB of storage as standard. It earned a score of 84 in our review — if you only need an iPad for roaming the internet, watching shows and doing some lighter productivity tasks, it's a good starter tablet.\nApple iPad Air (11-inch, M3) for $479 ($120 off): In our opinion, the iPad Air is the best iPad for most people as it strikes an ideal balance between performance, price and features. The M3 chip is almost overkill for a tablet, but it means performance should never be an issue. And upcoming productivity gains from iPadOS 26 should make the tablet even more powerful.\nApple Watch Series 10 for $280 ($120 off): We consider Apple’s flagship wearable to be the best smartwatch you can buy, period. It's a mostly iterative update, with faster charging, a slightly slimmer design and a marginally larger display than the prior Series 9. That said, it's still a comprehensive fitness tracker, and no other smartwatch can integrate as neatly with iPhones and other Apple devices.\nPrime Day audio deals\n\n\nSony WH-1000XM5 headphones for $298 (25 percent off): While the XM6 headphones are the latest and greatest, they only make small changes to the already stellar XM5. These were our top pick for the best wireless headphones for a long time before the XM6 launched earlier this year, and we still like them for their excellent sound quality, strong ANC, multi-device connectivity and good battery life.\nSony WH-CH720N headphones for $78 (48 percent off): The cheapest Sony headphones we'd recommend that are no slouch. They're lightweight and comfy with respectable sound for the price. You also get Adaptive Sound Control, 360 Reality Audio and multipoint Bluetooth on this budget model.\nSonos Beam Gen 2 for $369 (26 percent off): The second-gen Beam soundbar has support for Dolby Atmos and it has a relatively streamlined design that should be easy to fit into most home entertainment setups.\nBeats Pill for $98 (35 percent off): The Beats Pill is one of the few portable bluetooth speakers we liked enough to give it a full review. Those of you who love the classic Beats bluetooth speakers will be happy to know they're back in fine form. Nobody can beat the Pill for bass, and its sound is crisp and lossless at almost any frequency and volume. For some reason, only the Kim Kardashian branded version is on sale, but it's the exact same speaker.\nPrime Day laptop deals\n\n\nMicrosoft Surface Laptop (13.8-inch, Snapdragon X Plus) for $880 (27 percent off): In addition to running on a Snapdragon X Plus processor, this 2024 Surface Laptop has 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD. It's a Copilot+ PC that also has a 13.8-inch touchscreen, and it should last up to 20 hours on a single charge.\nGoogle Pixelbook Go (13-inch, Intel Core M3) for $299 (54 percent off): The Pixelbook Go is a bit old at this point, but if you're a Chrome OS lover and want a Google-made laptop, this is a solid option. It includes an Intel Core M3 processor, 8GB of RAM, 64GB of storage and a 12-hour battery life.\nPrime Day tech deals\n\n\nInstant Pot Duo Plus 9-in-1 multicooker for $70 (50 percent off): This six-quart pressure cooker and multicooker is a versatile kitchen tool for anyone who (somehow) didn't buy into the Instant Pot craze a few years back. It can do a lot with its nine cooking modes, including pressure cook, slow cook, steam, rice cook, saute and more, and the six-quart size is great for families and meal-preppers.\nRing Doorbell Battery + Indoor Cam 2 for $70 (50 percent off): If you're looking to build out a security system in your home, this bundle is a good place to start, giving you a video doorbell and an indoor security camera. You'll be able to see both live feeds in the Ring app, and they can send you motion alerts and let you speak to people on the other end of the camera when you're not at home.\nKindle for $85 ($25 off): Our favorite budget option in our guide to the best ereaders, the latest base Kindle has 16GB of storage — more than enough to hold hundreds of books at a time. It has a compact and durable design that’s easy to take anywhere, and the latest model is faster than before with speedy page turns and a more seamless navigation between books, your library and other parts of the UI.\nNinja Dual-Zone air fryer (10 quart) for $180 ($70 off): This model is one of our favorite air fryers thanks to its dual-zone cooking system, which allows you to prepare two separate foods at different temperatures and settings. There's even a Match Cook feature that ensures both foods will be done at the same time, regardless of their cooking settings.\nLevoit Core 400S air purifier for $183 ($37 off): Our top pick for the best air purifier, Levoit's Core 400S reliably improved air quality in our testing, plus it has easy to use onboard controls and replaceable filters that are not too expensive. We also found it to not be offensively loud, even on its highest setting.\nTP-Link Deco XE75 Wi-Fi 6E mesh system for $200 (20 percent off): Our top pick for the best mesh Wi-Fi system, this Deco XE75 three-pack is easy to set up and provides excellent performance with no-frills. The Deco mobile app lets you check speeds for each node, and you can see all of the devices on your network at any time.\nKindle Scribe for $260 ($140 off): The Scribe is one of the best E-Ink tablets you can buy at the moment, and certainly the top pick if you want a writable table that also excels as an ereader. It provides a great reading and writing experience, thanks in part to its ability to access the entire Kindle ebook library, and it has handy Google Drive, Microsoft OneDrive and Dropbox integration.\nDyson V15 Detect Plus for $570 ($180 off): You can't get much better than a Dyson if you're on the market for a cordless stick vacuum, and the V15 Detect delivers. It's our current top pick for the best cordless vacuum overall thanks to its excellent suction power, lightweight design, good battery life and the included Fluffy Optic cleaning head that uses a laser to show you where all the debris is while you're using it.\nAmazon 55-inch Omni mini-LED Fire smart TV for $700 ($120 off): A top-of-the-line model in the Fire TV family, this set has a 4K QLED mini-LED display with 1,400 nits of peak brightness and \"intelligence picture\" technology that adapts the screen to your room's lighting conditions. It also has a 144Hz refresh rate and support for AMD FreeSync.\nSamsung 55-inch The Frame QLED 4K smart TV for $798 (47 percent off): This is the set that spurred all of the art TV copycats, and it's been a favorite of our staff for a long time. Samsung's set looks like a piece of art hanging on your wall when you're not watching TV, and you can cycle through thousands of images to show on the TV so you'll always have something new to display.\nHisense S7N CanvasTV (65-inch) for $898 (31 percent off): Hisense's spin on Samsung's Frame sets, the CanvasTV, comes in much cheaper and with a boatload of features. The S7N sports an anti-glare display and art mode, as you'd expect, but there's also 144Hz support for a bit of gaming. It also comes with a slim wall mount so you can hang it on your wall like a genuine work of art. (The 55-inch model is also a great deal at $689, and the 77-inch is down to $1,399.)\nWhat is Prime Day?\nPrime Day is Amazon's members-only shopping event, which means you’ll have to be a Prime subscriber on Prime Day to take advantage of most of the savings. Amazon still offers a 30-day free trial to new Prime subscribers, so you can start your free trial closer to July and participate in the event.\nWhen is Prime Day 2025?\nAmazon Prime Day 2025 will be back this year on July 8 through July 11.\nHow often is Prime Day?\nAmazon Prime Day typically comes around annually in July. In the last few years, Amazon has also had its \"Big Deal Days\" in October, which is effectively a second Prime Day and the unofficial kickoff to the holiday shopping season.\nHow does Prime Day work?\nPrime subscribers can go to Amazon's site on Prime Day to see all of the exclusive deals they have access to. Prime subscribers do not have to do anything additional to get Prime Day sales: the discounts you see on product pages will show up in your cart automatically. If you're not a Prime subscriber and you go to Amazon to shop on Prime Day, you'll likely see tons of items on sale but only \"with Prime;\" those discounts will not be available to those who are not active Prime subscribers.\nIs Prime Day only for Prime members?\nTechnically yes, but even if you do not pay for a Prime membership, you should still check out Amazon on Prime Day. While most Prime Day deals will be exclusively available to subscribers, there are always a handful of sales available to all shoppers. Amazon distinguishes between them very clearly: you'll see \"Prime exclusive\" on product pages near the deal pricing on the discounts that are only available to paying members.\nSeparately, it’s very likely that other retailers like Walmart, Target and Best Buy will have their own competing Prime Day sales during that time frame, too. So if you're not keen on shopping at Amazon at all, it's worth checking out other retailers during the week of Prime Day to see if they are matching Prime Day deal prices.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-amazon-prime-day-deals-offer-discounts-on-headphones-tvs-robot-vacuums-and-more-120028355.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "You won’t find many discounts on Apple’s own website — but that doesn’t mean you have to pay full price for a new iPad or pair of AirPods. The second day of Amazon’s July sale is here and we’ve tracked down the best Prime Day Apple deals from across the site. We found deals on a long list of the Apple devices we recommend, including the new iPad, the MacBook Air, the Apple Watch Series 10 and everyone’s favorite (and the tiniest) Apple gadget, the AirPods Pro. Check out below for the best Prime Day deals on Apple gear — we even linked out to our reviews so you can read up before you buy. \nBest Prime Day iPad deals\n\n\nApple iPad (A16) for $280 ($69 off): The latest edition of Apple’s standard iPad isn’t powerful enough to run Apple Intelligence, but we don’t think that’s an issue. In his review, Enadget’s Jeff Dunn praised the tablet’s speed, calling it “plenty fast” for browsing the web, streaming video, editing photos and playing most games. It’s the most affordable iPad (especially now) and it easily handles the basics. This is a new all-time low price.  \nApple iPad Air (11-inch, M3) for $479 ($120 off): In our opinion, the iPad Air is the best iPad for most people as it strikes an ideal balance between performance, price and features. The M3 chip is almost overkill for a tablet, but it means performance should never be an issue. And upcoming productivity gains from iPadOS 26 should make the tablet even more powerful. This is the lowest price we've seen so far for this model, and it's still in stock. \nApple iPad Mini (A17 Pro) for $379 ($120 off): Apple’s smallest iPad earned an 83 review score from us when it came out late last year. Despite its compact size, it’s still a fully-featured iPad, with support for accessories and a laminated, anti-reflective screen. It’s not a laptop-replacer, but rather the perfect couch companion, handling games, video, web browsing and email triage. This deal is the cheapest the mini has ever been.  \nApple iPad Air (13-inch, M3) for $679 ($120 off): This is Apple’s most affordable large-screen iPad. Engadget’s Nate Ingraham awarded it a review score of 89 upon its debut this March. When you pair it with accessories like a keyboard folio and mouse, it becomes a true productivity machine — though those add-ons make it a pricey package. Good thing iPads are on sale for Prime Day. This $120 discount matches the lowest price we've seen over the past couple months.  \nApple iPad Pro (11-inch, M4) for $899 ($100 off): We named the iPad Pro the best tablet money can buy. The screen is one of the best we’ve seen and Apple somehow managed to make the Pro model lighter than Air models. If you plan on handling heavy productivity — video rendering and editing, machine learning apps and the like, this is the way to go.\nBest Prime Day AirPod deals\n\n\nAirPods Max (USB-C) for $430 ($119 off): Apple’s only over-ear headphones are due for an update. The company outfitted the AirPods Max with a USB-C port late last year, but the internals haven’t had an overhaul since 2020. Still, we named them the best (and only) over-ear AirPods. They are comfortable and relatively lightweight, have a balanced sound and the noise cancellation is solid. The headphones dipped down to $399 (in starlight) on Tuesday, but have now popped back up to $430.\nAirPods 4 (with ANC) for $119 ($60 off): Apple introduced the fourth generation of its basic earbuds alongside the iPhone 16 last September. This model includes ANC — a first for Apple’s “regular” buds — and Billy awarded them an 86 in his review. Just note they don’t have a fully closed design like the Pro models — but some may prefer the open fit, which Apple completely redesigned to fit more securely.\nAirPods 4 (without ANC) for $89 ($40 off): Apple introduced two models of its fourth generation basic earbuds alongside the iPhone 16 last September. This one doesn't have the extra features of ANC or Transparency Mode (which makes them cheaper). This pared down model benefits from a shape redesign — which our headphone expert, Billy Steele, found both more comfortable and more secure — as well as improved sound quality that’s more immersive than before.\nBest Prime Day MacBook deals\n\n\nMacBook Air (M4, 13-inch) for $849 ($150 off): Engadget’s Devindra Hardawar named the M4 MacBook Air the best laptop overall. It’s remarkably thin and light, with an excellent battery life, and the M4 chip is powerful, making this an ideal ultraportable productivity machine. Apple reduced the starting price by $100 compared to the last MacBook Air, and this deal only makes it an even better buy.\nMacBook Air (M4, 15-inch) for $1,049 ($150 off): If you want a little more screen real estate, go for the 15-inch Air. Devindra found the screen more immersive than the smaller model, and only slightly less portable. The slightly larger battery gave it a few more minutes of life. Whichever size you go for, the MacBook Air will be able to handle all but the most demanding rendering tasks without breaking a sweat.\nMacBook Air (15-inch, M3, 24GB RAM) for $1,249 ($450 off): This higher-specced version of the M3 MacBook Air from last year has a 15-inch screen and a little extra internal memory. We gave the 15-inch model a score of 90 in our review when it came out in early 2024. Outside of its older M3 chip (which is still plenty fast for everyday use), marginally improved camera and inability to power two external displays with the lid open, this MacBook is virtually identical to the M4 version.\nWe found a few non-Apple laptops on sale for Prime Day, too.  \nBest Prime Day Apple Watch deals\n\n\nApple Watch Series 10 for $279 ($120 off): Apple only announced one new smartwatch last September and this is it. It’s a little wider than the Series 9, but thanks to a slimmer design, it doesn’t feel clunky. The health and fitness tracking is still better than most smartwatches out there and the integration with an iPhone is seamless. There’s a reason it’s our favorite smartwatch overall. This is the lowest price we've ever tracked on the wearable, though throughout the day, Amazon has been oscillating between limiting the deal to Prime members and opening the price to anyone.  \nApple Watch SE for $169 (32 percent off): We wouldn’t be surprised to see an update to Apple’s budget smartwatch sometime soon (and we have a few suggestions on the matter). But thanks to some serious discounts, the Apple Watch SE has turned out to be the most affordable way to get an iPhone companion for your wrist. Despite the lackluster screen and limited extra features, it handles the basics well.\nApple Watch Ultra 2 for $650 ($149 off with Prime): The second generation of Apple’s premium smartwatch came out in 2023 along with the iPhone 15 (last September it just got a new Titanium Black colorway. The Ultra model is geared towards serious athletes and outdoor adventurers, packing specialized features like a 40-meter depth gauge, dual-frequency GPS and an on-board siren.\nBest Prime Day deals on Apple accessories\n\n\nApple Pencil (USB-C) for $69 ($10 off): Before you buy an Apple Pencil, check this compatibility page to make sure it’ll work with your model and generation of iPad. To say the least, it’s confusing. This model has the widest compatibility, but note that it doesn’t charge through its magnetic attachment, you’ll need to use the USB-C for refilling it. It went as low as $59 on Tuesday. \nApple Pencil Pro for $99 ($30 off): Apple announced the Pro version of its pencil at the same time as the iPad Pro with the M4 chip. It adds haptic feedback, squeeze gestures and roll capabilities to the usual stylus tricks. It works with the newest iPad Pro, Air and Mini models.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-prime-day-apple-deals-on-airpods-ipads-macbooks-and-more-for-day-two-150005586.html?src=rss",
    "full_text": "The M3 chip is almost overkill for a tablet, but it means performance should never be an issue. Apple iPad Mini (A17 Pro) for $379 ($120 off): Apple’s smallest iPad earned an 83 review score from us when it came out late last year. Engadget’s Nate Ingraham awarded it a review score of 89 upon its debut this March. This one doesn't have the extra features of ANC or Transparency Mode (which makes them cheaper). MacBook Air (15-inch, M3, 24GB RAM) for $1,249 ($450 off): This higher-specced version of the M3 MacBook Air from last year has a 15-inch screen and a little extra internal memory.

    "full_text": "Cluely, an AI startup that uses a hidden in-browser window to analyze online conversations, has shot to fame with the controversial claim that its ‘undetectability’ feature lets users “cheat on everything.” Marketing itself as an “anti-Cluely,” Truely claims it can detect the use of unauthorized applications by interviewees or others during online meetings. “The invisibility function is not a core feature of Cluely. In fact, most enterprises opt to disable the invisibility altogether because of legal implications.” Lee responded to Shen on X by praising Truely, but adding that Cluely “will likely start prompting our users to be much more transparent about usage.” Since securing a $15 million Series A from Andreessen Horowitz last month, Cluely has shifted its marketing strategy away from promoting ‘cheating.’ The company’s tagline has recently been changed from “cheat on everything” to “Everything You Need.

    "summary": "There is nothing more sublime than having a perfectly kitted out gaming station. That said, staying on top of things with the current pace of technology is always tricky. But for anyone hunting for upgrades, Amazon Prime Day is the perfect opportunity to improve your gaming setup on a discount. So regardless of whether you're looking for some cables, extra storage or a brand new monitor and headphones, we've gathered all the best gaming deals in one place for easy reading.\nBest Prime Day deals on video games\n\n\nThe Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom (Nintendo Switch) for $52 ($8 off) \nWe rarely see discounts on first-party Nintendo games, especially when it comes to major franchises like The Legend of Zelda. But for Prime Day, Echoes of Wisdom is available for 15 percent off, which is even more impressive when you consider the game the game is less than a year old. Not only is this the first Zelda game to put our beloved princess in the spotlight (instead of Link), it offers a fun twist on the series' classic top-down action RPG formula thanks to Zelda's new ability to summon objects and monsters with the Tri-rod.\nThe Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom (Nintendo Switch) for $55 ($15 off)\nAlternatively, if you are looking for something a bit faster paced, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom may be one of the best sequels in recent video game history. And now for Prime Day, it's available for $15 off its normal retail price. Not only is this a great pickup for anyone who hasn't played it yet, it's also a great showcase of the Switch 2's capabilities as users can purchase a $10 upgrade pack (or get it for free if you have a subscription to Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack) that adds support for HDR, faster loading times, enhanced textures and smoother framerates. \nStar Wars Outlaws - Limited Edition (Amazon Exclusive), PlayStation 5 for $29 ($31 off)\nAt full price, this game was easy to skip. But now that it's available for just $29 (half off its normal retail price), Star Wars Outlaws suddenly becomes a lot more interesting for fans of the franchise. You get to live out your dreams of being an intergalactic scoundrel while taking down bounties or battling secret crime syndicates. And because this is the limited edition, the game includes some pre-order rewards like the Kessel Run bonus pack and the Rogue Infiltrator bundle.\nAssassin’s Creed Shadows - Limited Edition for PS5/Xbox Series X for $48 ($22 off)\nIf you missed the latest entry in Ubisoft's most well-known franchise, this might be the time to jump in because for Prime Day, Assassin's Creed Shadows is available for $48, more than $20 off its regular retail price. This instalment has you explore feudal Japan as either the shinobi Naoe or the legendary samurai Yasuke while encountering some notable figures from the time period. If all you want is a wonderful world to sneak around in, it's hard to go wrong with Assassin's Creed on a discount.\nElden Ring: Shadow of The Erdtree Edition for PS5/Xbox Series X for $60 ($20 off)\nElden Ring is one of the most highly regarded games of this decade so far (and arguably of all time). For Prime Day, you can become a foul tarnished by picking up a version that includes the base game and the Shadow of the Erdtree expansion for $60. Elden Ring typically costs around $50 (though it's down to $30 on PS4, PS5 and Xbox Series X for Prime Day) and the DLC will usually run you another $40, so that's a decent discount compared with buying them separately — or even the Shadow of the Erdtree Edition at its regular price. \nThe Last of Us Part I – PlayStation 5 for $33 ($36 off)\nThe Last of Us is one of the greatest modern video game franchises, spawning both a critically acclaimed sequel and TV adaptation. For Prime Day, you can now get part one of the remastered version for more than 50 percent off. This latest edition for the PS5 features a brand new game engine, improved loading speeds and haptic feedback support for Sony's DualSense controller and more, which is enough to make the series feel like an entirely new experience (even if you played the original back in the day). And while it isn't getting as big of a discount, you can also pick up The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered on Amazon for just $40 (10 off its regular price).\nFinal Fantasy I-VI Collection Anniversary Edition for PlayStation and Switch for $45 ($30 off, lowest ever price)\nThis collection of pixel remasters of the first six Final Fantasy games is an absolute steal at $45 during Prime Day. It's the lowest price we've seen to date for this set, which comes with a nice little sticker sheet of character sprites. Several other games in the series are on sale for PS5 as well, such as Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade ($30, $10 off), Final Fantasy VII Rebirth ($40, $30 off) and Final Fantasy XVI ($25, $15 off)\nBest Prime Day deals on VR headsets\nMeta Quest 3S 128GB Bundle for $249 ($51 off)\nThe Quest 3S is one of our picks for best VR headsets for good reason. Meta cut just the right corners from the more full-featured Quest 3, enabling it to drop the list price down lower. It has the same Snapdragon chip and controlers, but cheaps out a bit on the lenses, slightly lowering the graphics fidelity in use. Just like the Quest 3, it works standalone for lighter games and streaming, or in concert with a gaming PC for full-fat AAA VR titles. It's well worth the $300 Meta usually asks for it, so at $249 with two games included (Cardboard Hero and the excellent social VR hit Gorilla Tag), it's a steal.\nBest Prime Day deals on PCs and PC components\nRazer Blade 14 with RTX 4070 for $2,300 ($400 off)\nThe Blade 14 is one of my favorite laptop lines because it combines a super sleek chassis with solid performance and truly excellent build quality. And now, as a way to get in on the Prime Day festivities, Razer has an exclusive offer on its website that will knock $400 off configs with RTX 4070 GPUs or up to $300 on models with RTX 4060 cards. These kind of savings go a long way towards neutralizing my biggest issue with Razer's laptops: their price. So if you're looking for a system that can do some serious gaming but is still easy to carry around, you're going to want to snap this deal up fast. \nASUS ROG Strix G16 Gaming Laptop with RTX 4060 for $1,360 ($340 off)\nWhile an RTX 4060 isn't the most powerful GPU on the market, getting a whole new laptop with solid specs for just $1,360 isn't something you can just ignore, especially if you're on a budget. This ROG Strix G16 comes with 16GB of RAM and 1TB of storage. And while its Intel Core i9-14900HX CPU is one generation old, it's still plenty fast enough for gaming, video editing or pretty much anything else you need to do. I also appreciate small features like a MUX switch that lets the laptop connect directly to the GPU for increased performance, though if you want, you can also enable automatic switching for better battery life. And with a 16-inch 240Hz QHD display with 100% DCI-P3 coverage, everything on screen is sure to look great.\nAcer Nitro V gaming laptop with NVIDIA RTX 4060 GPU for $1,200 ($150 off, lowest ever price)\nAcer's Nitro gaming laptops are meant to be more affordable alternatives to its flagship Predator systems. But now thanks to Prime Day, this model just got even more budget-friendly while still offering decent specs. You get an Intel Core i9-13900H CPU with 32GB of RAM, 1TB of storage and an RTX 4060 GPU, the latter of which should pair nicely with its 15.6-inch full HD 144Hz display. I also appreciate that unlike some gaming laptops, the Nitro V is stylish without being in your face with too many RGB lights, which makes it feel like an even better deal at $1,200. That's the lowest price we've seen to date for this configuration.\nCorsair Vengeance RGB DDR5 RAM 32GB (2x16GB) RAM for $95 ($25 off)\nAdding some extra memory to your desktop can help unlock its full potential. So for Prime Day, Corsair is offering two 16GB sticks of its Vengeance DDR5 RAM for just $95. Not only do you get built-in RGB lighting, Corsair's onboard voltage regulation makes it simpler to overclock your system. And for those who don't want to mess around in BIOS settings, you can control almost everything from the easy-to-use free iCue app.\nThermaltake GF1 (2024) Fully Modular ATX 850W Power Supply for $80 ($30 off, lowest ever price)\nEven though power supplies aren't the most exciting component you can put in your desktop, the importance of a good one can't be understated. For just $80, which is the lowest price we've seen to date for this product, the Thermaltake GF1 is fully modular (which means you can add or remove power cables as you need them) and has an ample max power of 850 watts along with an 80 Plus Gold rating for efficiency. And thanks to its 140mm fan, it should be pretty quiet, so it won't cause a ruckus if you decide to play some games at night.\nSamsung 990 EVO Plus 2TB PCIe M.2 SSD for $114 ($63 off)\nIf you're like me and are constantly running out of storage, this deal for one of Samsung's 990 EVO Plus 2TB M.2 SSDs is a fantastic way to add extra room on the cheap. With a 36 percent discount for Prime Day — down to $114 — this is the lowest price we've ever seen. And it's not like you're cutting corners on speed either, as the SSD supports both PCIe 4.0 x4 and PCIe 5.0 x2 and read/write rates of up to 7,250/6,300MB/s.\nAMD Ryzen 5 9600X 6-Core, 12-Thread Unlocked Processor for $165 ($110 off)\nThe Ryzen 5 9600X isn't super flashy, but it's a really solid budget CPU. And now, it’s even more affordable during Prime Day where it's going for just $165, which is $110 off its normal retail price. It features six cores and 12 total threads with a max boost speed of 5.4GHz and support for DDR5 RAM and PCIe Gen 5. It's also unlocked, so you have the freedom to overlock if you want. That said, you will need to buy a CPU cooler separately, as one doesn't come in the box.\nAMD Ryzen 9 9950X 16-Core, 32-Thread Unlocked Desktop Processor for $434 ($215 off)\nThe biggest issue with the Ryzen 9 9950X CPU was that at launch, it was a bit overpriced. But during Prime Day, that problem is being addressed thanks to a $215 discount that brings its cost down to under $500. The CPU features 16 cores and 32 threads along with 80MB of cache and support for DDR5 RAM and PCIe Gen 5. However, like some of AMD's other processors on sale this week, you will need to get a CPU cooler separately.\nBest Prime Day deals on gaming peripherals\nRazer Enki Gaming Chair for $450 ($50 off)\nIf you're going to be spending all day in front of a screen gaming, you better make sure whatever you're sitting on is super comfy. And as I've been using the Razer Enki every day for the last four years, I can attest that this chair is worth the money. It has a ton of adjustability for things like the arm rests, seat height and more. For more flexible folks, it was even designed so people can sit cross-legged. I also appreciate that in homes where neon green might not fit your vibe, there's an all-black model (plus a pink one too, though that one is currently sold out).\nElgato Stream Deck MK.2 for $110 ($40 off, lowest ever)\nIf you've ever dreamed about becoming a gaming streamer or simply want some extra customizable controls for your PC, Elgato's Stream Deck MK.2 could make a great addition to your setup. It has 15 programmable macro keys with built-in LCD displays so you can make custom buttons for switching scenes, turning on lights and so much more. Elgato also has plugins for services like YouTube, Twitch, Discord, so it'll play nicely with all the major streaming platforms. In short, it's like a command center for all your content creation and livestreaming needs.\nLogitech G305 Lightspeed Wireless Gaming Mouse for $29 ($21 off)\nThe Logitech G305 Lightspeed gaming mouse is just a simple PC peripheral done well. And at just $29, it's super affordable during Prime Day too. It features six programmable buttons, compatibility with both PCs and Macs and a sensor with sensitivity of up to 12,000 DPI. Meanwhile, thanks to a battery that lasts up to 250 hours between charges, you can go weeks between needing to plug it in. And because it's wireless, there won't be any cords or cables to get in your way.\nAmazon Luna Controller and one month of Luna+ for $40 ($30 off)\nThe Luna Controller by itself is down to $40, which matches a record-low price. However, if you're a newcomer to Luna+, you may as well pick up this bundle (which is also matching a record low) for the same price, as it includes one month of access to the service for new subscribers. This gamepad is a solid option for those who want to check out Luna, Amazon's cloud gaming service. Prime subscribers get access to a dedicated channel with a rotating selection of games at no extra cost. This month, for instance, you can check out Death Stranding Director's Cut, Hollow Knight and EA Sports FC 25. \n8BitDo Retro Mechanical Keyboard for $80 ($20 off)\nWith its Retro Mechanical Keyboard, 8BitDo strikes a great balance between a nostalgic design and support for more modern features like wireless connectivity (both BT and 2.4GHz). There are several different versions to choose from, though the one inspired by the classic NES is the model I'd choose. The keyboard features an 87-key layout with PBT keycaps and Kailh Box switches, though because the PCB is hot swappable, you can always change them out for something else.\nSony Inzone H9 Wireless Gaming Headset for $198 ($102 off)\nFor anyone looking for a new pair of over-the-ear wireless gaming headphones to pair with a PS5, it's hard to do better than Sony's Inzone H9 headset. Not only does it have a similar design to the console, they are the only other headphones besides the official Pulse cans that support on-screen status notifications for volume, mic mute, game/chat balance and more. They also share a lot of the underlying tech used in Sony's iconic WH-1000XM line, so you'll get fantastic audio quality and active noise cancellation. But the best part is that at $198, you're looking at a serious discount of 34 percent, which is more than $100 off its regular retail price.\nSeagate Storage Expansion Card 2TB Solid State Drive for $209 ($21 off)\nGames are getting bigger every day, so if you need some extra storage for your Xbox Series S or X, you'd be silly not to pick up one of Seagate's 2TB Expansion Cards for just $209. That's enough room for a dozen or more digital titles (or like three versions of Call of Duty) and it's the biggest SSD storage module that slots into the back of the console without the need for a separate box.\nAmazon Basics UPS Battery Backup & Surge Protector 800VA/450W for $65 ($10 off)\nI'm not here to nag, but if you have a desktop PC, you really ought to consider adding a UPS (uninterruptible power supply) to your setup as they prevent power surges or momentary outages from knocking your system offline. Plus, this one has a beefy 450-watt battery backup and 12 outlets so you can connect all of your other PC gadgets to it. So if you're going to do the smart thing by adding some extra electrical protection to your home during Prime Day, you might as well save some money in the process.\nBest Prime Day deals on mobile gaming gear\nSamsung Galaxy S25 Ultra (512GB) for $1,055 ($365 off)\nWith Samsung's next Unpacked event expected to show off new foldables, it looks like some of the existing models are getting some serious discounts for Prime Day, including the Galaxy S25 Ultra. And at $1,055, this is the lowest price we've seen for Samsung's current flagship phone yet. For gamers, thanks to its Snapdragon 8 Elite chip, the S25 Ultra offers some of the best performance you can get in a phone right now, while its built-in vapor chamber should help prevent throttling. Its 6.9-inch AMOLED display is also one of the best mobile screens on the market today.\nRazer Kishi Ultra for $100 ($50 off)\nRazer doesn't normally run a ton of deals for Prime Day, but it seems this year the company is making an exception as there are discounts on everything from gamepads to headsets and more. That said, one of the standout deals is for the Kishi Ultra gaming controller. On top of just being a well-built gamepad add-on for phones and tablets, its larger dimension and USB-C port means it works with a huge range of devices — both Android and iOS. This even includes more niche devices like foldables like the Galaxy Z Fold series, which often don't fit inside other mobile gamepads due to their unique design.\nBest Prime Day deals on gaming monitors and TVs\nSony 85-Inch Class 4K Ultra HD Bravia 3 LED TV for $1,098 ($500 off)\nThere's no better way to upgrade your living room gaming setup than with a brand-new, big-ass TV. Granted, the Bravia 3 is one of Sony's entry-level models (fancier sets get higher numbers), but with a discounted price of $1,098 for a massive 85-inch panel, this deal represents one of the biggest screens you can get for the money. It also has Google TV built in, so you'll get a very simple and straightforward way to stream your favorite shows and movies from services like Netflix, HBO and more. But perhaps most importantly is that for PS5 owners, the Bravia 3 supports exclusive features when connected to a PS5, such as Auto HDR Tone Mapping and Auto Genre Picture mode.\nAlienware AW2725DF 26.7-inch OLED gaming monitor for $600 ($300 off)\nFor anyone who has been waiting for prices of OLED gaming monitors to drop, this may be your chance to pounce on a great deal. That's because at $600, Alienware's 26.7-inch OLED display strikes a good balance between price and performance with a 360Hz refresh rate, 2560 x 1440 resolution and support for AMD FreeSync Premium Pro. And of course, you get those lovely pure blacks and vivid colors that OLED panels have become known for.\nSamsung Odyssey Neo G9 Series 57-inch 4K 240Hz 4K gaming monitor for $1,600 ($700 off)\nThis 57-inch monitor isn't for people with limited space. But if you've got the room, at $1,600, this is the lowest we've ever seen the Neo G9 as this deal represents a whopping $700 savings compared to its regular list price. This thing features a solid 240Hz refresh rate along with support for AMD FreeSync Premium Pro, a 1000R curve and Quantum mini LED tech with 2,392 local dimming zones. For people who love ultra-wide displays, this should be at the top of your upgrade list during Amazon Prime Day.\nAcer Nitro 27-inch WQHD IPS gaming monitor for $170 ($120 off)\nAnyone looking for a solid and affordable 1440p gaming monitor during Prime Day should really check out this 27-inch IPS display from Acer. For just $170 (matching a record-low price), it features a relatively speedy 180Hz refresh rate along with support for AMD FreeSync Premium and a good color range that covers 95 percent of DCI-P3. The height-adjustable stand can also swivel and pivot, while thin bezels on top and on the sides will make sure it won't look dated in a few years. So while this thing isn't super fancy, it's simple and competent in the best ways.\nBest Prime Day deals on batteries and power packs\nUGREEN Magnetic Power Bank 10,000mAh fast charging battery pack for $30 ($3 off)\nThe Switch 2 is a fantastic handheld, but its longevity could be better. So if you're planning to take it on a long trip, pick up UGREEN's 10,000mAH fast charging battery pack to help keep running when you're away from a plug. This power pack almost has enough juice to fully refill a Switch 2 twice, which can add between five and 12 hours of additional game time (depending on the title). It also has an output of 20 watts, which is as much as the Switch 2 can suck down at once, but it's still super pocketable measuring just four inches long and 0.7 inches thick. And if you need a convenient way to recharge your phone, the battery pack also comes with Qi wireless support.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-prime-day-gaming-deals-from-laptops-and-peripherals-to-the-latest-video-games-085719478.html?src=rss",

Thanks to Prime Day, though, finding deals on the right charging accessories can help tame the chaos. A great GaN wall charger, for example, can power multiple devices simultaneously while reducing desk clutter. And a versatile power bank ensures you can quickly recharge your phone or laptop anywhere. Below, you’ll find a selection of power banks, wall warts, and charging stations at up to 55 percent off. Whether you’re jetting off to a faraway destination, enjoying the outdoors with friends or family, or organzing your office, there’s something for everyone. Prime Day is a full four days this year, running through July 11th, so you’ll have plenty of time to shop and save. We’ll be updating this post as the event rolls on, but for now, some of our best finds are below."

    "summary": "Prime Day is a great time to pick up gear and upgrades you wouldn't normally think about. In case you've never used a solid-state drive (SSD) before, it's a class of add-ons that bolster a device's built-in storage. Not only will your phone, laptop or console be able to hold more data, but more of those files will be quickly accessible, which can vastly improve your speeds. If you have used an SSD before, you know what you're looking for — the best discounted drives on Amazon. We've curated a list below for your Prime Day shopping.\nBest Prime Day SSD deals\n\n\n\nCrucial BX500 for $57 ($38 off): The Crucial BX500 SSD is compatible with any computer that uses a 2.5-inch SATA drive — which is still plenty of them. For very cheap, you can get ahold of 1TB storage space and read speeds up to 540 MB/s, close to the very best possible for a SATA SSD.\nWD_BLACK SN850X for $150 (25 percent off): Our current favorite Gen4 NVMe drive is on sale for Prime Day, making a read speed of over 7,000 MB/s more accessible than ever. In our tests, we found the 1TB SN850X significantly boosted our Windows operating speeds without adding much heat.\nWD Blue SN5000 for $210 ($90 off): Here's a great deal on an internal SSD with 4TB capacity and compatibility with the fast-performing NVMe protocol. Western Digital, the same brand behind the WD_BLACK (see above) claims the Blue model can hit read speeds of 5,500 MB/s.\nLexar 1TB NM790 for $67 (29 percent off): The NM790 is a single-sided SSD that can post sequential read speeds of 7400 MB/s. The one-sided design means it stays cooler for longer, and this 1TB deal includes a heatsink. It's a great budget alternative to the also single-sided Samsung 990 Pro (see below).\nSabrent Rocket 2230 for $150 (15 percent off): The Sabrent Rocket 2230 is a thumbnail-sized NVMe card that we found to be perfect for the M.2 slot on a Steam Deck. Thanks to this deal, you can save a lot by buying a lower-end Steam Deck and upgrading it with one of these.\nSamsung Fit Plus for $23 ($12 off): The Fit Plus is our favorite thumb drive, and it's not close. Running on USB 3.1 with transfer speeds between 300 and 400 MB/s, it even comes with a keychain hook. The current deal takes 34 percent off an already cheap product.\nSamsung 870 EVO for $76 (24 percent off): The 870 EVO is a great budget choice for general users, who are likely to get a speed boost on any PC activity once it's installed. At 560 MB/s of maximum reading speed, it's not for hardcore gamers, but everyday users should see real benefits.\nSamsung 990 Pro for $150 (29 percent off): The whole Samsung Pro line of SSDs is excellent for gamers, with PS5s in particular seeming to run much faster with one installed. The 990 Pro can reach read speeds of up to 1,400 KB/s — and yes, that's kilobytes, not megabytes.\nSamsung 9100 Pro for $220 ($100 off): Samsung's first NVMe SSD dropped earlier this year, and currently, they're still a bit faster than most people can use. However, if you want to get a jump on the next console generation with 14,800 MB/s sequential reading speed, this deal is your opportunity.\nKingston Fury Renegade for $420 ($210 off): Although it sounds like a Jamaican kung fu movie we'd watch the hell out of, the Kingston Fury Renegade is actually a 5th-gen NVMe SSD that can reach hardcore read speeds of up to 14,800 MB/s. It's expensive, but Prime Day discounts knock off 33 percent.\nCorsair MP600 Pro LPX 2 TB for $160 (20 percent off): Earlier this year, we named the Corsair MP600 Pro LPX as the top SSD for PS5, partly due to its affordability. It's even more affordable now — and the low price even includes a heatsink.\nAcer FA100 1TB for $51 (15 percent off): The Acer FA100 isn't the fastest SSD, but it is at least competitive, and may be one of the cheapest ways to harness the considerable power of NVMe 3.0. Only the 1TB version is marked down for Prime Day.\n\nBest Prime Day portable SSD deals\n\nSamsung T7 for $114 ($74 off): The T7 spent a long time as our reigning champion portable SSD, and it's still an amazing deal — being technically outdated means record-low prices on hardware that's more than fast enough for a Steam Deck or Switch.\nSamsung T9 for $170 ($130 off): We once named the Samsung T7 as our favorite portable SSD, but the T9 handily outdoes it, nearly doubling data transfer speeds. It's marked down 43 percent from now until the end of Prime Day on the 11th.\nSanDisk 1TB Extreme for $78 ($52 off): SanDisk designed the Extreme for portability, and it shows — this is an almost indestructible SSD you can keep in just about any bag or pocket. It's also reasonably fast, though it only works with USB-C\nCrucial X9 Pro 1TB for $75 (17 percent off): As a Gen 2 USB drive, the Crucial X9 Pro loses out to some newer competitors on speed — but it's much cheaper, and far more compatible with everyday personal computers. The 1TB model is on sale at 17 percent off its normal price.\nCrucial X9 Pro 2TB for $120 ($60 off): The Crucial X9 Pro with 2TB storage space is marked down 33 percent for Prime Day.\nCrucial X10 1TB for $82 (24 percent off): The Crucial X10 is a portable SSD for power users, only working at full strength on devices that support the latest version of USB 3.2. If that's what your build needs, you're not likely to see it much cheaper than this.\nCrucial X10 2TB for $135 (18 percent off): A 2TB version of the X10 is almost 20 percent off right now.\nCrucial X10 Pro 2TB for $150 (28 percent off): The Crucial X10 Pro is perfect for a fairly small range of users. If your PC build currently works with USB 3.2 Gen 2x2 but isn't yet handling USB4 or Thunderbolt, you won't find a faster portable SSD for your needs.\nKingston XS1000 for $80 (15 percent off): We named the Kingston XS1000 the second-best portable SSD in our current roundup, so it's great to see it going for 15 percent off today. It's almost as fast as the Crucial X9 Pro, just not quite as tough.\nADATA SE920 for $142 (5 percent off): The piddly 5 percent off is disappointing, but there's nothing disappointing about the ADATA SE920 itself. This is the ideal model for anyone regularly making huge downloads. The SE920's maximum read speed of 3,800 MB/s would be impressive for a full-size SSD, but it's fully portable, weighing less than half a pound.\nGarmese 1TB Portable SSD for $64 (20 percent off): This portable SSD uses USB3.2 to achieve read speeds of around 1000 MB/s, which is very impressive for a device not much larger than a flash drive. While it downloads fast, it's not fantastic for transferring multiple files at a time.\n\nBest Prime Day microSD card deals\n\nLexar Professional Silver Plus for $38 ($35 off): Our tests showed this to be the fastest microSD card on the market, beating out the whole Samsung line. Not only is it fast enough to download and upload 4K files without trying your patience, it's also waterproof, cheap and squeezes in both USB-A and USB-C ports.\nLexar E-Series for $31 (15 percent off): While the Silver Plus beats it out, the Lexar E-Series remains more than fast enough for 4K video, and is sufficiently rugged to fit in your adventure camera. This deal includes a five-pack of microSD cards, working out to about six dollars per 64GB of storage.\nSamsung Pro Plus for $17 ($9 off): The Samsung Pro Plus is a great microSD card for most needs, so if it's cheaper than the Lexar option, go for it. We've found that it's particularly good in handheld game systems. Just make sure to get the version rated for 180 MB/s, nothing less (it should say on the package).\nSanDisk Ultra 256GB microSDXC for $17 (15 percent off): If you're still rocking the Switch 1 (thanks, Target) and want a cheap storage expander, this deal on a SanDisk 256GB microSD card is for you. It's going for $17 right now, far less than most of the games you're likely to store on it.\nSamsung Evo Select for $22 (27 percent off): This one's by far the best option if you're after a cheap microSD card — we've seen it on sale for less than $25 more than once. It's a bit too slow for cameras, but fine for any kind of undemanding passive storage.\n\nBest Prime Day external hard drive deals\n\nSeagate Portable for $65 (19 percent off): All the Seagate hard drives we've used are refreshingly good at combining thin, light hardware with consistent speeds, and the Portable is no exception. At 4TB, this is a great deal on an external HDD with no tradeoffs.\nSeagate Game Drive for $76 (16 percent off): Seagate's Game Drive is a prime choice for adding extra space to a PS5 or Xbox Series X. Formerly overpriced, it's now dropped down to $90 for 2 TB, and that's before Prime Day makes it even cheaper.\nWD My Passport for $160 (14 percent off): The Western Digital My Passport line is ancient by computer hardware standards, but it's been updated as far as USB 3.0 and 3.1, and remains one of the cheaper options for a 6 TB hard drive. This version includes automatic backup software.\nWD Elements for $149 (15 percent off): The Elements HDD from Western Digital has gotten consistently positive feedback from our staff over the years, and as an older model, it's now wildly cheap for 6 TB of storage. It's compatible with both PC and Mac out of the box.\nWD_BLACK P10 Game Drive for $161 (15 percent off): We're big fans of the WD_BLACK SSD, and the gaming-focused external P10 is a worthy companion. It comes with 6 TB of storage for your PC, PS5, or Xbox gaming library.\nUnionSine 500GB External Hard Drive for $27 (19 percent off): UnionSine's HDD is fast and USB3 compatible. Despite how thin and light it is, we've found it remarkably hard to damage. 500GB may be a bit tight with the size of files these days, but at this price, you could just buy two of them.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-prime-day-ssd-and-external-hard-drive-deals-on-samsung-crucial-and-more-090355162.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Prime Day is the time to trawl Amazon for the best in all things, including high-quality speakers at bargain prices. For much less than usual, you can add a new lynchpin to your soundsystem. That could be a space-saving soundbar for a smaller space, a smart speaker to jam out while you're busy in the kitchen or a bluetooth speaker you can bring with you anywhere. We've rounded up a list that includes Echo, JBL, Beats, Anker Soundcore and more of the best audio brands — so if you're ready to hear every last eighth-note of your favorite tracks, let's get started.\nBest Prime Day Bluetooth speaker deals\nOur portable bluetooth speaker picks are some of the best all-around mobile music devices to ever hit the shelves: smaller and lighter than a boombox, better audio than an iPod, and way easier in the long run than learning to play guitar. We've sifted through Prime Day offerings to find the best portable speakers in all shapes and sizes. \n\n\n\nTribit Stormbox Micro 2 for $56 (20 percent off): This tiny portable speaker packs a wallop — you won't believe how high you can crank the volume on such a small, light device. Weighing in at about one pound, it includes a rubber strap for attaching it to your backpack or bike, and comes with a USB charging port.\nBeats Pill for $98 (35 percent off): The Beats Pill is one of the few portable bluetooth speakers we liked enough to give it a full review. Those of you who love the classic Beats bluetooth speakers will be happy to know they're back in fine form. Nobody can beat the Pill for bass, and its sound is crisp and lossless at almost any frequency and volume. For some reason, only the Kim Kardashian branded version is on sale, but it's the exact same speaker.\nSoundcore Motion 300 for $53 (34 percent off): The Motion 300 is that rare portable speaker that outperforms at both high and low frequencies. Its upper range goes into 40 kHz, while its bass can deliver bone-shaking thumps even outdoors. All that in 1.7 pounds with 13 hours of battery life — and it's even partially waterproof.\nAnker Soundcore Motion+ for $75 (24 percent off): Tough, sturdy construction makes this speaker an excellent choice for home bluetooth. Its battery lasts for 12 hours in the wild, and it always sounds great, but it's a bit heavy for pedaling through the park. There's also an option for wired connections, and it even works as a backup soundbar.\nAnker Soundcore 2 for $28 (38 percent off): The Soundcore 2 is an older bluetooth speaker, but it holds up — fully waterproof, with 24 hours of battery life and bass you can hear on the other side of a pool. It's on sale for less than $30.\nSoundcore Select 4 for $19 (46 percent off): This 9.3-ounce speaker is a massive improvement over built-in smartphone audio. It can fill a room at a decent range of frequencies, and works well in room-sized outdoor spaces — plus, with IP67 waterproofing, it can survive a dip in the pool. It's currently almost half off.\nUE Everboom for $190 ($80 off): If you want something stronger than the Wonderboom but the Hyperboom isn't portable enough, the Everboom is a great middle ground. Its ideal range is a little narrow, but it makes up for that with 360-degree sound and extreme durability (i.e. so waterproof it literally floats).\nJBL Go 3 for $28 (30 percent off): The JBL Go 3 improves on its predecessor with a carabiner-friendly design, five hours of battery life, and IP67-rated waterproofing and dustproofing. It's not exactly powerful, but it's way better than a phone speaker for driving, trekking or camping.\nJBL Go 3 Eco for $28 (30 percent off): This is the same as the JBL Go 3, but made from mostly recycled materials — 90 percent of the plastic and 100 percent of the fabric is post-consumer.\nJBL Pulse 5 for $200 ($50 off): The Pulse 5 is JBL's latest and greatest party speaker, throwing out 360-degree light bursts that sync up to the music. There's substance behind the flash, too, with speakers designed around the bass frequencies and 12 hours of battery life.\nBose SoundLink Flex 2nd Gen for $99 (33 percent off): This mini speaker from Bose is one of our favorites on the list for hands-free phone calls. It supports both Google Assistant and Siri and runs up to 12 hours on one charge, all while being smaller than a clutch purse. It also kills as a portable music player, though the sound doesn't stretch far enough to fill a room.\nBose Soundlink Revolve+ Series II for $179 ($120 off): The Revolve series was Bose's first line of 360-degree outdoor speakers, and they're still a strong choice today. The Revolve+ weighs about two pounds and can run for 17 hours without recharging.\nBose Soundlink Max for $299 ($100 off): Bose's Soundlink Max marries a classic carrying-case design with audio that sounds like it's coming from a much bigger unit. It comes with a 20-hour battery and IP67-rated protection against the elements.\nMarshall Emberton II for $95 (47 percent off): Marshall has been making audio equipment for more than 60 years, and still has a thing or two to teach the young'ns. The Emberton II looks like a classic amp, but weighs a quarter of a pound and provides balanced sound for more than 30 hours per charge.\nMarshall Acton III for $200 ($100 off): All right, so a six-pound speaker isn't exactly portable — but if you can stand lugging it around, the Acton III can be a highly versatile device. From music to outdoor parties to pulling double duty as a soundbar, this is a low-setup, low-overhead option for nearly all audio tasks.\nOrtizan X10 for $30 (41 percent off): Ortizan is a newer brand from China, but we like what we've seen from them so far. The X10 is the size of the Beats Pill but comes at the price of a belt-clip speaker like the JBL Go 3. If you do have a problem, Ortizan's customer service is highly responsive.\n\nBest Prime Day smart speaker deals\nSmart speakers aren't just about getting a disembodied voice to do your bidding (or at least as much of your bidding as Alexa can do without hands). On top of assistant support, the picks below serve up legitimately great audio quality alongside useful extra features. The only downside is that they're often overpriced, but that's what Prime Day is for.\n\nAmazon Echo Dot for $32 (36 percent off): Amazon may not have updated the Echo Dot since 2022, but that just goes to show how well this spherical smart speaker serves as the perfect host for Alexa. Both music and speech sound clear, and it's easy to integrate with other smart home devices. Right now, it's marked down more than a third.\nAmazon Echo Pop for $22 (45 percent off): The latest Echo Pop release continues the trend of making Alexa's best features available on a mini-sized, reasonably priced device. Its half-spherical design fits on any desk or shelf, and its sound output is consistently clear — and gets louder than you might believe.\nSonos Era 100 for $179 ($20 off): Smart speakers from the Amazon Echo line play perfectly good music, but true audiophiles in need of assistant support should look to Sonos. The Era 100 has tweeters and woofers precisely arranged for clear, full-room sound, and it's easy to hook up to your other audio gear. Just be warned it only supports Alexa, not Google Assistant.\nJBL Authentics 200 for $200 ($180 off): JBL's Authentics line is modeled after a product it sold in the 70s. Its old-school bookshelf-friendly design belies its advanced feat of running Google Assistant and Alexa simultaneously (as opposed to other smart speakers where you have to pick just one).\nJBL Authentics 300 for $300 ($150 off): The JBL Authentics 300 can host both Alexa and Google Assistant at the same time, which impressed us enough that we gave it a full review. While we had some issues — namely its tendency to over-emphasize vocals — we can't quibble with its high-range performance or retro design.\n\nBest Prime Day soundbar deals\nFlatter, lighter and larger TV screens are nice for visuals, but often sacrifice sound quality to lose weight. If you've found yourself turning on the subtitles for your shows more often lately, you might need a soundbar to augment your TV's built-in speakers. We found a few of the best on sale for Prime Day — Sonos leads this space, but it's not without competitors.\n\nBose Smart for $400 (20 percent off): In our full review of the Bose Smart, we noted that two drivers in the center make its sound feel directional without any other speakers needed — simply cranking up those makes any audio more immersive. You can also link it to a pair of Ultra Open Earbuds (not included) for a private surround sound experience.\nBose Smart Ultra for $700 ($200 off): The Smart Ultra upgrades the Bose Smart with a more sophisticated calibration system which adjusts sound settings to fill whatever room it's in. If you want the Smart's personal surround experience for more than one person, the Smart Ultra is for you.\nSonos Beam for $369 (26 percent off): The Sonos Beam is a fantastic choice for a mid-budget soundbar. It's one of the most accessible Dolby Atmos systems, and uses careful audio alterations to achieve a much more immersive sound than other bars of its size.\nSonos Ray for $169 (15 percent off): If you're looking to pay a bit less, go with the Sonos Ray to maximize sound quality on a budget. The audio won't wrap around your room like it might from a more premium model, but it's still a vast improvement on nearly all built-in TV speakers.\nSony HT-S400 for $178 (41 percent off): Sony built the HT-S400 for everyone who wants a soundbar but not an entire home theater. It's a 2.1-channel system that still manages immersive surround sound and is easy to integrate with Sony TVs. Right now, it's 40 percent off, one of the best prices we've seen on any soundbar.\nSony Bravia Theater Bar 6 for $448 ($200 off): One of Sony's newest audio products, the Bravia Theater Bar 6 is a 3.1.2 soundbar that can bend audio in more directions to fill your theater space. It can handle Dolby Atmos, and has an integrated AI feature that recognizes and clarifies human voices.\nVIZIO 2.0 for $78 (22 percent off): Vizio's budget soundbar makes a worthy alternative to the Sonos Ray. It punches above its weight and gets as close as possible to Dolby Atmos surround sound as a single unit can manage. For less than $100, you'll never mishear a line of dialogue again.\nJBL Bar 9.1 for $760 ($440 off): The 9.1 is JBL's first sound bar to be compatible with Dolby Atmos, and it doesn't disappoint. Each unit comes with two wireless speakers you can move around your viewing room, and there's even a 4K passthrough input to ensure your sound system doesn't mess with image quality.\nSennheiser Ambeo Mini for $600 ($200 off): We recommend the Sennheiser Ambeo Mini for a relatively cheap premium soundbar. It excels in smaller spaces (though it needs an extra subwoofer to fill larger ones), and its connected app includes several sound presets you can use to optimize its virtual speakers.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/best-prime-day-speaker-deals-on-jbl-bose-sonos-and-others-085948443.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Sure, TV prices have fallen a ton recently, but Amazon’s Prime Day proves they can get even cheaper. So it’s time to consider an upgrade, especially if you’re rocking an older 1080p or first-gen 4K set. Newer TVs not only offer better brightness, contrast and HDR capabilities, but you can likely find a much larger set than you currently own for far less than you think. (You’d be surprised how much 75-inch, 85-inch and even 98-inch sets have fallen.) Here’s our collection of choice TV offerings from Sony, Samsung and LG, as well as streaming devices, soundbars and speakers to consider.\nBest OLED TV deals\n\n\n\n\nLG OLED Evo C5 (65-inch) for $1,746 (down from $2,700): LG has steadily improved its C-series over the years, and the C5 Evo is its best model yet. In addition to the usual benefits of OLED, it also sports a brightness booster that can help it work well in bright rooms, as well as LG’s own “Perfect Color” technology. It doesn’t have quantum dots like Sony and Samsung’s OLEDs, but it’s also coming in significantly less than those models. The C5 Evo also has a fast 144Hz refresh rate for gaming, as well as support for NVIDIA’s G-SYNC and AMD FreeSync variable refresh rate technology. (If you’re looking for something larger, the 77-inch model has also been discounted to $2,800.)\nSony Bravia 8 II (65”) QD OLED for $2,998 (down from $3,500): Sony’s top of the line set has everything you’d want in a high-end TV, like quantum dots for improved color and brightness, as well as the inky dark blacks and infinite contrast of a modern OLED panel. You’ll always pay a bit of a premium for Sony TVs, but partially that’s due to their world-class image processing – in this case, that’s handled by Sony’s XR chip. (You can also snag the 55-inch model for $2,500.)\n\nBest Mini LED TV deals\n\n\n\nTCL QM8K (65-inch) QD Mini LED for $998 (down from $1,800): TCL's QM8 sets feature the company's best and brightest Mini LED screens with Quantum Dots. It has an ultra-thin bezel, 144Hz refresh rate for fast gaming and one of the best contrast ratios you'll see outside of an OLED screen. Basically, it's one of the best screens you'll find that's not an OLED. While we think the 65-inch model is a great deal for most rooms, you can also step up to the 75-inch for $1,500, the 85-inch for $2,199 and the massive 98-inch set for $3,000. \nTCL QM6K (98-inch) QD Mini LED for $1,800 (down from $3,000 MSRP): The QM6K is one of the best deals we’ve seen on a 98-inch TV under $2,000, and best of all, it's not just a bargain bin screen. It has a bright Mini LED display with quantum dots for enhanced color, and it sports a fast 144Hz refresh rate for gaming. It’s also a pretty solid Prime Day deal, coming in much lower than the previous $2,200 low price. (If you don’t have the wall space for a nearly 100-inch set, the 65-inch model is similarly great and is down to $550, nearly half off its $1,000 MSRP and $100 off its lowest price. The 75-inch model is also a great deal at $850.)\nSony Bravia 5 (85-inch) Mini LED for $2,298 (down from $2,800): The Bravia 5 pairs a super bright Mini LED panel with Sony’s XR image processing chip. It won’t reach the deep dark black levels of OLED, but Mini LED achieves something close, and it can also get much brighter than OLED panels. That makes this model, as well as any Mini LED TV, an excellent option for bright rooms. (You can also scale down to the 65-inch and 75-inch Bravia 5 for $1,300 and $1,800, respectively. And there’s also the truly massive 98-inch model, which is now $1,000 off at $5,000.)\nHisense U7 (75-inch) Mini LED for $750 (down from $900): The Hisense U7 is a great bargain when it comes to Mini LED sets. It offers Quantum Dots, full array local dimming for better contrast and a fast 144Hz gaming mode. It's one of the best options around if you're looking for a large TV that's bigger than 65 inches under $1,000.  \n\nBest Frame-style TV deals\n\n\n\n\nSamsung The Frame Pro (65-inch) for $1,899 (down from $2,200): New for 2025, Samsung's Frame Pro sets offer brighter and higher-quality Mini LED panels for a superior TV watching experience. The 65-inch Frame Pro is a great option for most living rooms since it's large enough to deliver an immersive viewing experience, and it also comes with Samsung's wireless One Connect box for less cable clutter. While there's still no OLED Frame TV yet, this Mini LED set is the closest you'll get today. (If you're looking for something larger, the 75-inch Frame Pro is down to $2,699, and the 85-inch is $3,799.) \nHisense S7N CanvasTV (65-inch) for $898 (down from $1,300): Hisense's spin on Samsung's Frame sets, the CanvasTV, comes in much cheaper and with a boatload of features. The S7N sports an anti-glare display and art mode, as you'd expect, but there's also 144Hz support for a bit of gaming. It also comes with a slim wall mount so you can hang it on your wall like a genuine work of art. (The 55-inch model is also a great deal at $689, and the 77-inch is down to $1,399.)   \n\nBest budget TV deals\n\nAmazon Fire TV (50-inch) for $260 (down from $400): Amazon’s budget Fire TV sets handle the basics just fine, and at this price the 50-inch model is a compelling deal as a second or third TV set. It supports HDR10 (but not Dolby Vision), and as you’d expect, it also has the Amazon Fire TV OS built-in, giving you access to over 23,000 apps. It also sports Amazon’s Alexa Voice Remote to help you find content quickly. (You can also go up and down in size, depending on your needs. The 43-inch model is now down to $220, and it’d be a solid choice for a small bedroom or office.)\nHisense QD6 (55-inch) for $240 (down from $380): Hisense is on a roll delivering tons of TV features at a very low cost, and the QD6 line is a prime example of that. It has Amazon's Fire TV and Alexa support built in, and it also supports Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos. It can even handle a bit of fast gaming with a 120Hz refresh rate.\nTCL QM6K (55-inch) for $448 (down from $600): TCL's mid-range sets finally fall below $500 for Prime Day, and that makes the QM6K one of the higher quality options in this price range. It features a bright Mini LED panel, a 144Hz refresh rate for gaming and it even includes an Onkyo speaker setup built-in. While it's technically a budget set at this price, it certainly won't look like a low-grade TV.\nRoku Smart TV (32-inch) for $100 (down from $143): Not every room needs a large TV — this Roku Smart TV is perfect for a small bedroom or office. It's powered by Roku's OS and it comes with a Voice Remote. While it only offers a 720p resolution, that will still look decently sharp on a screen this small.\n\nBest soundbar and speaker deals\n\n\n\nSonos Beam Gen 2 for $369 (down from $499): Sonos's latest Beam is one of the best mid-range soundbars on the market. It's compact, but it also delivers expansive sound. And it also supports Dolby Atmos through a bit of speaker virtualization. The Beam is also ideal if you've already got Sonos speakers, since you can pair them all together for some household jams (or just bring your TV audio to different rooms).\nTCL S55H soundbar for $100 (down from $160): At this price, the TCL S55H delivers a ton of audio bang for the buck. It comes with a wireless subwoofer, features auto room calibration and supports virtualized surround sound like Dolby Atmos and DTS Virtual:X. With 220W of power behind its sound, the S55H should be powerful enough to fill most rooms.\nSony Bravia Theater Quad for $2,000 (down from $2,500): Leave it up to Sony to do something different in the world of home entertainment. The Bravia Theater Quad are a set of four flat modules, containing a total of sixteen speakers, which deliver truly enveloping surround sound. They’re the ideal solution for anyone who wants a theatrical experience, but doesn’t want to see gigantic tower or bookshelf speakers in their space. They support Sony’s 360 Spatial Sound Mapping, as well as Dolby Atmos and DTS:X.\nSony Bravia Theater Bar 9 for $998 (down from $1,400): The Bravia Theater Bar 9 is Sony’s most capable self-contained soundbar, with 13 speakers and support for virtualized surround sound with Dolby Atmos, DTS:X and Sony’s own 360 Spatial Sound Mapping technology. It’s the best option if you want to enjoy your favorite movies and music loud, but also don’t want to see speakers all over your living room. (The Bravia Theater 8 is also discounted to $698 and very well-equipped, with 11 speakers and the same surround sound support. )\nSony Bravia Theater System 6 for $568 (down from $770): If you want real surround sound from an actual subwoofer and satellite speakers spread around your room, the Bravia Theater System 6 is a solid choice. It pairs together a soundbar, wireless subwoofer and two rear satellites (connected by a wireless amplifier). It’s a great option for apartments and small living rooms where you just can’t live with virtualized surround sound. (You can also snag the soundbar on its own for $448, down from $650.)\n\nBest streaming deals\n\n\n\n\nRoku Ultra for $69 (down from $100): Roku's ultimate set-top box is the best streamer for home theater enthusiasts who want to avoid the more expensive Apple TV. It handles every video and audio format you'd want — including Dolby Vision, Atmos and HDR 10+ — and it also comes with Roku's rechargeable Voice Remote Pro. The Roku Ultra is the fastest device from the company, so you can expect to zip around Roku's interface and apps far quicker than the cheaper streaming sticks.\nRoku Streaming Stick+ for $30 (down from $40): The Roku Streaming Stick+ is the easiest way to bring Roku's robust app selection to any 4K TV. It's a great option for first-generation 4K sets that either had no streaming apps, or are way too slow by now. And it's a great gadgets to bring on trips to maintain access to all of your favorite streaming services.  \nRoku Streaming Stick HD For $20 (down from $30): The basic HD Roku Streaming stick is a solid option for bringing streaming apps to older TVs, which likely don't support 4K or any fancy HDR standards. Sure, it's as no frills as you can get, but for $20 it's worth having a backup streaming device. (or one you won't mind losing during a trip). And if you have an older TV that's still working, it's definitely worth investing a bit to get modern apps.\nAmazon Fire TV Stick 4K for $25 (down from $50): Amazon’s Fire TV Stick 4K is a simple way to add some streaming smarts to any TV with an HDMI port. Alternatively, you can load it up with your favorite streaming apps and bring it on the road – it sure beats fighting with apps built into hotel or AirBnb TVs. As a bonus, you can also play Xbox cloud streaming games when you pair a controller (Xbox GamePass membership required).     \nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/best-prime-day-tv-deals-2025-from-sony-lg-samsung-and-others-084705164.html?src=rss",

    "full_text": "The Powerbeats Pro 2 are only a few months old, but they’re already on sale for an all-time low of around $179.95 ($70 off) at Amazon, Walmart, and Best Buy. We’ve seen the wireless earbuds drop in price here and there since launching in February, but Amazon is currently one-upping the previous low by a cool $20 for Prime Day. The earbuds aren’t quite as cheap as Apple’s second-gen AirPods Pro, which are down to $149 ($100 off) at Amazon, but if you want a pair specifically for working out, the Powerbeats Pro 2 are the ones to get. It took beats nearly six years to release a sequel to the original Powerbeats Pro — and it was worth it. The latest model is our favorite pair of earbuds for sports and working out thanks to features like active noise cancellation, heart rate monitoring, and a handy transparency mode that pipes outsides noises in. The updated mics do a solid job of filtering out ambient noise, too, while on-ear buttons provide tactile feedback when controlling playback. They even support hands-free voice control via Siri. What makes the Powerbeats Pro 2 stand out among other Beats and Apple earbuds, however, is that they support heart rate monitoring. Each earbud features an optical heart rate sensor and accelerometer, which is the same tech found in the Apple Watch. If you don’t already rely on a fitness tracker to track your workouts, the Powerbeats Pro 2 are a decent alternative."

    "full_text": "Microsoft’s chief commercial officer Judson Althoff said during a presentation this week that AI tools are boosting productivity across sales, customer service, and software engineering, Bloomberg reports. Althoff noted AI has been so useful that Microsoft was able to save more than $500 million last year in its call center alone. The internal remarks come a week after Microsoft laid off more than 9,000 workers, the company’s third round of layoffs this year that put the total number of affected employees somewhere around 15,000. For employees who lost their jobs while working at a company that is reporting impressive cost-savings and recording one of its most profitable quarters yet, Althoff’s remarks might come off as tone deaf. The situation had already been complicated by a now-deleted LinkedIn post from Xbox Game Studios’ producer Matt Turnbull, who last week suggested that workers feeling “overwhelmed” by Microsoft’s layoffs — which included job cuts across Xbox — might find support through AI tools like ChatGPT and Copilot to help manage the cognitive load that comes with job loss. It’s not clear whether the thousands of workers who lost their jobs this year were replaced by AI or whether the layoffs represent post-pandemic right-sizing. What is clear is that workforce adjustments during a period of record profitability creates a challenging dynamic that, for some, has to sting. The company’s market capitalization has also surged in recent months to around $3.74 trillion, displacing Apple and trailing only Nvidia. The company said in January it would invest $80 billion into AI infrastructure across 2025. While Microsoft continues to hire talent, too, the company appears positioned to more actively participate in the industrywide competition of “Who Can Pay Top AI Researchers The Most?” In short, it’s more likely we’ll see Microsoft spend millions of dollars on top AI researchers rather than middle managers and other employees."

    "summary": "The second day of Amazon’s July Prime Day sale is here, and it’s a good time to stock up on accessories and smaller electronics. Every Prime Day tech deal here sells for $50 and under — some deals are even the best prices we've seen yet. Right now, Anker cables and chargers, Apple AirTags, microSD cards, Roku streaming sticks, portable speakers and more are all selling for a lot less than usual. But these aren’t just any gadgets — these are the products and brands we recommend based on Engadget’s own testing and reviews. Read on for the best Prime Day deals we could find on tech that costs less than $50. \nThe best Prime Day tech deals under $25\n\n\nSamsung Galaxy SmartTag2 Bluetooth tracker for $16 ($14 off): If you have a Samsung phone, the company’s own Bluetooth tracker may make the most sense for you. We say as much in our guide to these finding fobs. The design is attractive and the finding network admirable, drawing on the signals of nearby Galaxy devices to pinpoint your lost keys. \nAnker Right-Angle USB-C braided charging cable (two-pack) for $10 ($6 off with Prime): This is the cable I used to turn an old iPad into a digital picture frame. The right-angle looks much neater than a straight cable, plus this one can shuttle up to 240 watts of power during charging.\nAnker iPhone Nano Power Bank with Built-in USB-C Connector for $20 ($10 off with Prime): One of these little guys could represent the difference between a dead phone and a not-dead phone. It’s the size of an oldey-timey lipstick case and delivers a partial charge to any USB-C phone. We tested it out and awarded it a spot in our guide to power banks. The current discount only applies to the black colorway, and this is a few dollars higher than the all-time low of $16 it hit for Black Friday.\nJLab Go Sport+ workout earbuds for $19 ($11 off): Anyone looking for a cheap set of beater earbuds for the gym should check this out. It’s a recommendation in our guide to the best budget wireless earbuds and offers a solid eight-to-nine hours of battery life, passable (if somewhat compressed) sound and a water-resistant, around-the-ear design.\nAmazon Echo Buds for $25 (50 percent off with Prime): In our guide to the best budget earbuds, we called Amazon’s latest earbuds the best option for an open-ear design. That means they don’t go all the way in your ear canal, which is far more comfortable for some people. They’re sturdy, comfortable and the sound is decent once you’ve fiddled with the EQ settings to bring down the treble. This matches a previous low price — but is a bit more than a temporary Lightning deal for $15 that hit early on Tuesday.\nTP-Link Kasa Smart Bulbs for (four pack) for $22 (31 percent off): After testing a bunch of bulbs we deemed these the best value. Installation is easy, even for those new to smart devices, thanks to Kasa’s clean and simple app. Just note that voice control is only available with Alexa or the Google Assistant; Siri is unfortunately incompatible with these.\nAnker Nano USB-C charger block for $12 ($6 off): Remember when tiny bricks like this all maxed out at a dinky five-watts? This tiny but mighty cube is the best cheap fast charger in our guide to fast chargers and it outputs a generous 30 watts, plus the prongs fold down to make it even more teensy.\nAnker USB-C Cable 240W Bio-Braided for $13 ($6 off with Prime): We recommend this in our guide to iPhone accessories. It’s a reliable cable that’s durable and capable of fast charging (provided you have the right wall adapters). This matches its price in past sales.\nKasa TP-Link Smart Wi-FI outdoor plug for $17 ($8 off with Prime): We tested this one for our buying guide to smart plugs and named it the best outdoor pick for HomeKit users — but it’ll work with Alexa and the Google Assistant too. The range was decent and setup was easy, like most TP-Link plugs. Grab this now and have automatic control of your holiday lights.\nBlink Mini 2 security camera for $20 ($20 off with Prime): If you only want one Blink security camera, snag this deal. But if you can spring for a two-pack at $35, it's actually a better deal. Either way, it's our pick for the best budget security camera. Just note it requires a subscription for person detection and cloud storage, and the image quality wasn’t the best of the bunch. \nAmazon Fire TV Stick HD for $18 ($17 off with Prime): We name this the best budget streaming stick on our list of the best streaming devices. It's easy to set up and so you can access all of the major streaming platforms. Just note that it only streams content at 1080p, not 4K and the UI is more ad-heavy than competing streamers.\nApple AirTag for $20 ($9 off): Here’s our pick for a Bluetooth tracker for iPhone users. These little discs have the most accurate finding ability of any fob we tested, thanks to Apple’s vast Find My network that taps into all nearby iPhones to track down your missing stuff. They could be louder and hole would be nice, but nothing beats its accuracy. Just note that you'll get a cheaper per-tag price if you buy a four-pack. \nSamsung Fit Plus 56GB flash drive for $23 ($12 off): We named this the best thumbstick drive in our guide to the best SSDs. It has a sleek design, five-year warranty and has a USB 3.1 connection. There’s even a small attachment point for a keychain so you can take your extra storage drive with you when you go.\nJ-Tech Digital Ergonomic Mouse for $15 ($10 off with Prime and on-page coupon): The lowest price we’ve seen for one of our favorite ergonomic mice is $17 and now it’s even cheaper. This is the budget pick in our ergonomic mouse guide thanks to its vertical format, programmable buttons and nifty RBC lights (which you can turn off).\nThermacell E55 Rechargeable Repeller for $18 ($17 off with Prime): The mosquitos aren’t going anywhere. Even places that didn’t used to have these evil bloodsuckers are now overrun. If you would like some reprieve from the bites, this is the repeller we recommend in our guide to outdoor tech.\nTP-Link AC1200 WiFi extender for $20 ($10 off): If you’ve got some dead spots in your home’s internet coverage and aren’t quite ready for a mesh setup, a Wi-Fi extender can help. This is our favorite budget option in our guide to these plug-in devices thanks to its easy setup and user-friendly app.\nAmazon Echo Pop for $22 ($18 off with Prime): The smallest (and cheapest) Echo speaker is ideal for small apartments or rooms. The half-sphere design comes in purple and teal in addition to the standard black and white colorways. It's gone as low as $18 in past Prime Day sales. \nSoundcore Select 4 Go Bluetooth speaker for $19 ($16 off with Prime): One of the newest additions to our guide to the best Bluetooth speakers is this ‘lil guy from Soundcore (Anker). We found it had decent sound quality and was loud enough to fill a standard-sized living room. It's gone as low at $20 in the past.\nChipolo POP Bluetooth tracker for $25 ($4 off): The top pick in our guide to the best Bluetooth trackers was finally knocked off its throne — by another tracker from the same brand. This is our current recommendation for most people. It taps into either Apple’s Find My or Google’s Find My Device network (but just one at a time) and has a loud ring, quick Bluetooth connection and comes in fun colors.\nAmazon Smart Plug for $13 ($12 off with Prime): This plug and an Alexa Echo device makes a perfect smart home starter kit (and a number of Echos are on sale for Prime Day, too). Snap this into your outlet and Alexa should automatically detect it (if not, a few taps in the Alexa app should get things connected). Then you can use it to control any lamp, fan or other simple device you plug into it — just by asking the assistant.\nRoku Streaming Stick HD for $20 ($10 off): Roku just released two new streaming sticks this year. This standard model and the Plus model that supports 4K resolution. We recommend the latter in our guide to streaming sticks as the best way to catch free and live content, but if you don't have a 4K TV (or don't care about the resolution) you can grab this stick for 33 percent off. The Plus model is also on sale. \nThe best Prime Day tech deals under $35\n\n\nTP-Link Kasa Smart Plug Mini EP25 (4-pack) for $30 ($14 off with Prime): This is our favorite smart plug overall because it works with all four major smart home assistants (Alexa, Siri, Google Assistant and Samsung’s Bixby). In our tests, it connected easily and reliably controlled our lamps and other simple appliances.\nBlink Mini 2 security camera (two-pack) for $35 ($35 off with Prime): Our pick for the best budget security camera is now even more budget friendly. We appreciated this diminutive camera’s ease of setup and excellent integration with Alexa devices, like Echo speakers and displays. It requires a subscription for person detection and cloud storage, and the image quality wasn’t the best of the bunch. If you just need one camera, you can pick one up for $20.\nStar Wars Outlaws (Amazon Exclusive, PS5) for $29 ($31 off): At full price, this game was easy to skip. But now that it's available for just half price, it's a lot more compelling for Star Wars fans. The limited edition includes pre-order rewards like the Kessel Run bonus pack and the Rogue Infiltrator bundle.\n-> For more Prime Day gaming deals, check out our guide.\nRoku Streaming Stick Plus for $30 ($10 off): Roku replaced the Streaming Stick 4K with this model (which also supports 4K) earlier this year. We think it’s the best streaming stick for people who want to access free and live content on their TV. Roku’s interface is easy to use, colorful and lets you watch thousands of hours of free stuff, through Roku’s own content and more. You also get decently organized access to your paid content.\nAnker USB C Charger (Nano 65W) for $26 ($14 off with Prime): This is a similar model to the travel pick in our fast charger guide. It has three ports, two USB-C that deliver up to 65 watts each and a USB-A that can output 22 watts. That should refill your laptop, tablet and maybe some earbuds while not taking up too much space.\nAmazon Echo Dot Kids with Alexa for $32 ($28 off with Prime): The kids version of Amazon's smart speaker is the same hardware but with a kid-themed cover (owl or dragon) and it comes with a free year-long subscription to Amazon Kids+ with audiobooks, games and educational Alexa skills. The standard Echo Dot is on sale too, but we're disappointed in the sale price.  \nBlink Video Doorbell for $30 ($30 off with Prime): If you already use Alexa in your home and want a compatible video doorbell, you may want to check out this deal. Note that you’ll need a Blink subscription and a Blink Sync Module to store clips and to access other features. You can wire it to your existing doorbell wires or use it wirelessly with two AA batteries that can last up to two years.\nMoft Magnetic Phone Tripod for $32 ($8 off with Prime): I was impressed with how sturdily this small tripod held my phone. It folds down super thin but pops up to hold the phone in landscape or portrait orientation. The only downside is you’ll need to pop it off to wirelessly recharge (obviously) but removal and reattachment is quick.\nEarFun Free 2S wireless earbuds for $28 (30 percent off with Prime): These are fairly comfortable, have a good waterproof rating and deliver a decent amount of bass. They’re not going to deliver the fullest or most nuanced sound as more expensive buds, but for far less than $50, they’re a fine knockaround pair.\nAnker Soundcore 2 for $28 (38 percent off): The Soundcore 2 is an older bluetooth speaker, but it holds up — fully waterproof, with 24 hours of battery life and bass you can hear on the other side of a pool. It's on sale for less than $30. \n-> If you're looking for more speaker deals, check out our Prime Day speaker guide. \nThe best Prime Day tech deals under $50\n\n\nSoundcore by Anker Space A40 earbuds for $45 ($35 off with Prime): The top overall pick in our guide to the best budget earbuds delivers the kind of performance and features we’d expect from buds priced twice as high. These lil guys have effective active noise cancellation and a good battery life of eight hours — plus another 40 with the case.\nLexar Professional Silver Plus (512GB) for $38 ($35 off): We found this microSD card to be the best value of all the cards we tested. It consistently delivered faster sequential reads and writes than other models. If you need storage for your gaming handhels, camera, drone or other devices, may as well stock up now. \nHyperX Cloud Stinger 2 gaming headset for $37 ($14 off): In our guide to gaming headsets, we ultimately recommend getting an external mic along with a good pair of wired headphones for chatting. But if you really want a two-in-one, the Cloud Stinger 2 is our pick for a budget gaming headset.\nRazer Basilisk V3 gaming mouse for $36 ($34 off with Prime): Some prefer a wired connection when playing games. Razer’s Basilisk V3 is our top budget pick for a wired mouse in our gaming mouse guide. It’s comfortable, well-built, accurate and a good value — particularly with a Prime Day discount.\nAmazon Echo Spot for $45 ($35 off with Prime): The Spot speaker was resurrected last year with a slightly different design than it first had. Now the display is a half-circle on the round face of the clock and it can show you the weather, time and song title. The speaker itself brings you all Alexa can do, like setting timers, adding stuff to your grocery lists and answering questions about the weather.\nLeebin Electric Spin Scrubber for $38 (46 percent off with Prime): This was Deputy Editor Valentina Palladino's favorite thing she bought last year because it makes the must-detested chore of cleaning her shower less of a pain. It's an electric spin scrubber that comes with multiple cleaning heads so you can use it on your countertops, sinks, tubs and showers and more. It also has an adjustable arm so you can reach tough spots in hard-to-reach places, and it convenient recharges via USB-C.\nAmazon Echo Buds with Active Noise Cancellation for $45 ($95 off with Prime): These buds are a bit old at this point, as they came out in 2021, but the 68 percent discount could be compelling. In our review, we said the buds were much improved over the last generation. They're more comfortable and have a better sound quality. Plus the Alexa integration makes them a decent pick for those who've gone all-in on Amazon's ecosystem. \nRing Pan-Tilt Indoor Cam for $40 ($40 off with Prime): This indoor security camera can spin 360 degrees and has a tilt range of 169 degrees so you can keep tabs on pets and other happenings at home. It'll let you drop in for a live view from your phone, and supports two-way talk for telling your pup to get off the couch.\nUGreen Revodok Pro 109 USB-C Hub for $32 ($22 off): The top pick in our guide to the best USB-C hubs has a good array of ports, including an HDMI 2.0 connection that supports 4K monitors at 60Hz, plus three USB-A ports, Ethernet and one USB-C (plus another for delivering 90W of power to your device. The hub has gone as low as $30 in prior sales. \nAmazfit Band 7 fitness tracker for $38 ($12 off with Prime): The runner up in our guide to the best, cheap fitness trackers has a comfortable design we found easy to sleep with and a great, mutli-week battery life. The screen isn’t as bright and it wasn’t quite as speedy as our top pick, but it does let you easily set custom goals.\nHamilton Beach Digital Programmable Rice Cooker for $40 ($10 off with Prime): Our top pick for a budget rice cooker is on sale for Prime members. The brown rice came out particularly good in our tests and the cooker is easy to clean with a dishwasher-safe cooker pot and steamer basket. Just note that it’s pretty small and doesn’t have the granular controls of pricer models.  \n-> See more kitchen tech Prime day deals in our guide. \nExpired deals\nBlink Outdoor 4 for $45 ($55 off): We named this outdoor camera the best for Alexa homes in our security cameras guide. It can go just about anywhere you want as the wireless design runs on AA batteries and can last for two years before needing to be replaced. The motion alerts are accurate, but keep in mind you’ll need a subscription to enable person detection and cloud storage.\nJBL Go 3 for $28 (30 percent off): The JBL Go 4 gets a shout out in our guide to Bluetooth speakers, this is its predecessor. It's got a carabiner-friendly design, five hours of battery life, and IP67-rated waterproofing and dustproofing. It's not exactly powerful, but it's way better than a phone speaker for driving, trekking or camping.\nAmazon Echo Buds for $15 (70 percent off with Prime): In our guide to the best budget earbuds, we called Amazon’s latest earbuds the best option for an open-ear design. That means they don’t go all the way in your ear canal, which is far more comfortable for some people. They’re sturdy, comfortable and the sound is decent once you’ve fiddled with the EQ settings to bring down the treble. This is a lightning deal and the lowest price we've seen yet.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-amazon-prime-day-deals-on-samsung-blink-anker-and-more-all-for-under-50-160028179.html?src=rss",
    "full_text": "Every Prime Day tech deal here sells for $50 and under — some deals are even the best prices we've seen yet. The right-angle looks much neater than a straight cable, plus this one can shuttle up to 240 watts of power during charging. It’s the size of an oldey-timey lipstick case and delivers a partial charge to any USB-C phone. That means they don’t go all the way in your ear canal, which is far more comfortable for some people. Just note that it only streams content at 1080p, not 4K and the UI is more ad-heavy than competing streamers. This is the budget pick in our ergonomic mouse guide thanks to its vertical format, programmable buttons and nifty RBC lights (which you can turn off). We think it’s the best streaming stick for people who want to access free and live content on their TV. These lil guys have effective active noise cancellation and a good battery life of eight hours — plus another 40 with the case. The motion alerts are accurate, but keep in mind you’ll need a subscription to enable person detection and cloud storage. That means they don’t go all the way in your ear canal, which is far more comfortable for some people."

    "summary": "If you want to read more and stare at your phone less, an ereader can help. For this guide, we found the best Prime Day Kindle deals — plus a couple of deals on non-Kindle ereaders from Kobo and Boox. Now that we've hit the second day of Amazon's sale, we're still seeing a discount on every current-generation Kindle, so there's still time to shop. Engadget editors and reporters have tested nearly every model, and our reviews are linked below. You can also check out our buying guide to ereaders for background on how to get the most out of your device. Here are the best Prime Day Kindle deals we could find.\n\n\nBest Prime Day deals on Kindle ereaders\n\n\nAmazon Kindle for $85 ($25 off with Prime): The base model Kindle is our recommendation for the best budget ereader. Even when it’s not on sale, it’s the most affordable e-book device from a major manufacturer. It’s compact and durable making it easy to carry. It doesn’t have warm LEDs and it’s not waterproof but it’s the most affordable way to access Amazon’s vast e-book ecosystem. \nKindle case (fabric) for $24 (25 percent off with Prime): If you want to protect your new ereader, you can grab this case while it's 25 percent off. Note that only the blue and pink versions are $24, the black and matcha versions are $2 more expensive. \nKindle Colorsoft for $180 ($100 off with Prime): Amazon didn’t introduce color to its ereader lineup until early this year — long after Kobo and Boox. The list price of $280 makes it more expensive than other color display ereaders, but this discount helps with that. We appreciate the fast page turns, pinch to zoom feature and auto-adjusting warm front light.\nKindle Scribe 2 for $260 ($140 off with Prime): If you want a Kindle that lets you write as well as read, this is the one to get. We gave the Kindle Scribe 2 a score of 86 in our review and it’s our pick for the best e-reader E Ink tablet. It has a smooth reading and writing experience with low latency. It also lets you create multiple notebooks, add pages and change the templates easily.\nKindle Paperwhite for $125 ($35 off with Prime): The Paperwhite is an elevated version of the Kindle, with a larger, seven-inch, flush-front screen and an adjustable warm front light. A faster processor gives it quicker page turns than its predecessor and the device itself is waterproof.\nKindle Paperwhite Signature Edition for $150 ($50 off with Prime): The Signature Edition adds few more premium features to the Kindle Paperwhite with wireless charging, an auto-adjusting front light and more storage (32GB). We gave it an 85 in our review praising the premium build, remarkably clear text and fast page turns. We just wish the power button wasn’t on the bottom.\nKindle Kids for $95 ($35 off with Prime): The Kindle Kids edition is the same hardware as the standard Kindle, but you get a few added perks that are fitting for younger users. To start, a case comes standard. The warranty is extended to two years. And the purchase price includes a six month subscription to Amazon Kids+ for thousands of kid-friendly ebooks and more.\nKindle Paperwhite Kids for $130 ($50 off with Prime): Again, the kids version is the same as the Paperwhite but with a cover, extended warranty and access to Amazon Kids+ for six months. Just remember to cancel at the end of the trial or keep it and pay $6 per month.\nBest Prime Day deals on non-Kindle ereaders\nBoox Palma 2 for $270 ($30 off): This smartphone-shaped device is a delight. It’s built on Android and can run just about any app you can download from the Play Store — just don’t expect it to play video or graphics-intensive games. This is an E Ink screen, after all. But it’s perfect for reading books and running simple apps in a more eye-friendly format.\nKobo Libra Color for $210 ($40 off): Our favorite ereader with buttons has a premium, waterproof build that’s very comfortable to hold. The touch controls and buttons are responsive and deeply customizable. The color display brings more life to book covers and graphic novels, and it’s even stylus-enabled if you want to scribble on your books. This is the lowest price in a few months, but note that it dropped to $200 in January.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-prime-day-kindle-deals-and-ereader-sales-080957865.html?src=rss",

Anker makes some of our favorite charging gear and I always end up picking up an accessory or two during Prime Day to ensure I have what I need when I need it most, and I feel better knowing I didn't spend full price on it.\nLast year, for example, I picked up a couple of extra USB-C charging cables so I could keep one in my carry-on luggage so I always have one when I travel. Also, every year it seems I need yet another surge protector, so even though I picked one up last year, I'll probably do the same this year, too.

    "summary": "Day two of Amazon’s Prime Day is here, and it's still a good opportunity to save on products from every department — particularly kitchen tech. We have quite a few food-enthusiasts on staff at Engadget, and most of us have tried out at least a few cooking gadgets, all in the name of eating, er, journalistic discovery. Right now, many of the kitchen gadgets and accessories we recommend are on sale — some at the best prices we’ve seen yet this year. So if you’re in the market for a new Instant Pot, a Breville oven, an Anova sous vide machine or a Ninja air fryer, check out our list of the best Prime Day deals on kitchen tech below.\nEditor's note: We've been anxiously waiting to see if Ninja's Creami ice cream maker would see a good discount. Right now, a bundle with extra containers is selling for $200, but that's still well above the low of $160 we saw as recently as January. We'll continue to monitor the sale and will update this guide if the price goes lower.  \nPrime Day air fryer deals\n\n\nBreville Smart Oven Air Fryer Pro for $320 ($80 off): This is the premium pick in our air fryer guide — but really, it does far more than just air fry. As our reviewer noted, its massive cubic-foot-capacity and numerous cook modes make this more like an auxiliary oven. (It can even cook an entire 14-pound turkey.) It went on sale for $300 during last year's Black Friday sales. \nNinja Foodie Dual Zone Air Fryer (10 QT) for $180 ($70 off): This is the air fryer to pick if you’ve ever wished you could air fry two different things at the same time. We named it the best dual-zone air fryer you can get — it even has a feature that makes sure the two different foods are ready at the same time.\nInstant Vortex Plus Air Fryer (6 QT) for $100 ($70 off): After studious testing (and dutiful eating) our reviewers named this one the best air fryer you can buy. And, after reading that assessment, I bought one myself so I can verify this is one great machine. The Odor Ease tech really does keep the cooking smells at bay and the window lets me keep an eye on all the crisping that’s going on in there.\nInstant Pot Vortex Plus Air Fryer (4QT) for $65 ($65 off with Prime): Here’s a smaller version of the Instant air fryer we named best overall. It has a four-quart capacity, which is perfect for one person and small kitchens. And, like its larger sibling, pre-heats quickly.\nNinja Air Fryer (4 QT) for $80 ($50 off): The budget pick from our air fryer guide isn’t currently on sale, but this four-quart Ninja fryer has twice the capacity and is nearly the same price. It can also roast and dehydrate in addition to air frying and reheating.\nCheck out our guide to air fryers to read our testing results.\nPrime Day Instant Pot and rice cooker deals\n\n\nCuckoo Twin Pressure Rice Cooker for $190 ($70 off with Prime): This is the best premium rice cooker in our guide to those machines. We like how quickly it cooks all types of rice to perfection (we tested it with long-grain white basmati, brown and sushi-grade white rice). Just keep in mind that it can be a little difficult to clean and the manual isn’t the most user-friendly.\nHamilton Beach Digital Programmable Rice Cooker for $40 ($10 off with Prime): Our top pick for a budget rice cooker is on sale for Prime members. The brown rice came out particularly good in our tests and the cooker is easy to clean with a dishwasher-safe cooker pot and steamer basket. Just note that it’s pretty small and doesn’t have the granular controls of pricer models.\nPrime Day kitchen tech deals\n\n\nFellow Stagg EKG Pro electric kettle for $160 ($35 off): This exquisitely designed kettle has an LCD panel built into the base so you can choose a specific temperature down to the degree. And the hold feature keeps water hot for up to an hour. I bought this after reading our tea guide and appreciate the steady pour each morning.\nOoni Volt 12 Electric Indoor Pizza Oven for $630 ($270 off) from Ooni: Note: This deal has expired at Amazon, but is still available directly from Ooni. The Volt 12 is our pick for the best indoor pizza oven — but it can be used outdoors as well thanks to its weather-resistant design. It has front-mounted controls that let you individually control the upper and lower heating elements and it can get up to 850 degrees Fahrenheit in as little as 20 minutes.  \nNinja CREAMi Ice Cream Maker (bundle) for $200 ($30 off): We said this machine “makes your frozen dreams come true.” It’s easy to use and makes thick, dense ice cream with flavors that are more intense and textures that are smoother than rival ice cream makers. Plus most of the parts are machine washable or easily rinsed. This bundle comes with extra containers and is the lowest price we’ve seen in a few months, but note that the Creami sold for $160 as recently as January.\nBreville Joule Turbo Sous Vide Machine for $200 ($50 off): The premium pick in our guide to sous vice machines has a powerful 1,100-watt heater that cuts down on cooking times. It also uses your phone as the controller (just don’t get it if you’re hoping for on-device buttons).\nAnova Sous Vide Cooker 3.0 for $138 (40 percent off): Our top pick for a sous vide machine delivers 1,100 watts of power and a flow rate of eight liters per minute which will get your water up to the right temperature faster. It also has intuitive digital touch controls and Wi-Fi connectivity.\nBreville Juice Fountain Plus for $120 ($60 off with Prime): The extraction abilities on this machine are impressive. Plus we found it relatively easy to clean (as long as you do it right after you juice). It takes up a good amount of space, but can extract an impressive amount of juice from even the driest-seeming carrot. This is the lowest price in a while, but it went down to $110 in January.\nPrime Day KitchenAid and blender deals\nKitchenAid Classic Series (4.5 QT) for $300 ($50 off): Prime Day and Black Friday sales are usually the best times to snag Kitchen Aid’s iconic mixers — unfortunately, this discount isn’t even as good as the $250 it sold for in May. Still you can save $50 on a classic appliance that we recommend in our guide to essential kitchen gadgets. These mixers are durable, reliable and, with the wide range of attachments, can truly expand your cooking arsenal.\nVitamix 5200 Blender Professional-Grade for $350 ($150 off with Prime): I can personally attest to the nearly magical abilities of Vitamix blenders. It can make chunky salsas, smooth-as-silk soups and smoothies in which the chia and hemp seeds seem to disappear into the fruit. This pro-grade model is down to the lowest price we’ve tracked this year.\nKitchenAid Variable Speed Corded Hand Blender for $55 ($15 off): We recommend the cordless version of this immersion blender in our guide to those appliances. This corded version has the same variable speed trigger which makes it easy to control your recipes. Note that this sold for $5 less as recently as May.\nVitamix E310 Explorian Blender for $330 ($50 off): Note that we've seen this go for as little as $255 in past sales, and it dropped to $300 as recently as May. But this is still a decent $50 discount on a blender that will make any food you put in it smooth. We recommend it in our guide to the best kitchen tech.\nExpired deals\nMannkitchen Pepper Cannon for $160 ($40 off): Not everyone needs a super expensive pepper mill. But it nonetheless became one of our reviewer’s favorite pieces of kitchen gear. A side-by-side comparison showed us just how much more pepper came out of the cannon compared to a standard store-bought mill.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/amazon-prime-day-kitchen-deals-include-up-to-50-percent-off-on-air-fryers-instant-pots-blenders-and-more-180019208.html?src=rss",
    "full_text": "As our reviewer noted, its massive cubic-foot-capacity and numerous cook modes make this more like an auxiliary oven. It went on sale for $300 during last year's Black Friday sales. Instant Pot Vortex Plus Air Fryer (4QT) for $65 ($65 off with Prime): Here’s a smaller version of the Instant air fryer we named best overall. It has a four-quart capacity, which is perfect for one person and small kitchens. Fellow Stagg EKG Pro electric kettle for $160 ($35 off): This exquisitely designed kettle has an LCD panel built into the base so you can choose a specific temperature down to the degree. I bought this after reading our tea guide and appreciate the steady pour each morning. Ninja CREAMi Ice Cream Maker (bundle) for $200 ($30 off): We said this machine “makes your frozen dreams come true.” It’s easy to use and makes thick, dense ice cream with flavors that are more intense and textures that are smoother than rival ice cream makers.

That's why we spoke with three gastroenterologists about the frequency of regular bowel movements and other indicators to help you understand what's normal and when it might be worth reaching out to your doctor. The Mayo Clinic recommends eating high-fiber foods, staying hydrated and exercising as natural ways to prevent constipation. The chart is a form scale, meaning that it rates stool based on factors like size and consistency. Bristol stool type 1-2: Rabbit or grape-like droppings that are quite hard and may be difficult to pass. Bristol stool type 3-4: Corn on the cob or sausage bowel movements that are soft and easy to pass. Poop in these categories is also solid, while it may be either smooth or have some cracks on the surface. The good news is that changes to your diet can also produce really stinky stool. Muscle and nerve damage resulting from childbirth may also affect your ability to control bowel movements. She says this \"helps keep your bowel movements fuller and easier to pass.\""

Many of the unique compounds found in maple syrup have been shown to help combat cancer and diabetes. This sweetener is made from the stevia plant, and it's 200 to 400 times sweeter than table sugar. It adds sweetness without much else, which may be what you're looking for when cutting back on sugar. Remember that many stevia products on the market contain other processed ingredients or sugar alcohols, so it's important to do your research before using them. If you're looking for a more nutritionally balanced form of sugar, it's tough to beat raw fruits. The naturally sweet mogrosides in monk fruit also contain antioxidants, which can help with immune health and cancer prevention. While experts don't necessarily consider these drinks \"healthy,\" they can be a better option than traditional sodas. Make no mistake: these tasty alternatives are not substitutes for a fiber-rich diet and whole foods. If you can't stand that thought, consider adding other natural enhancers like cinnamon or vanilla extract instead."

After more than a decade working as a technology journalist, I'm in the fortunate position of having what most people would consider to be too much tech in my house. But with headphones, I've reached the conclusion that everyone needs at least three pairs. These need to have that heady combo of great noise cancellation, audio quality and battery life, combined with a level of comfort that means you could easily wear them for an entire long-haul travel day. Could you wear either of the above pairs to go on a long run? It really doesn't matter which headphones you choose for each of these purposes but I do believe they are distinct categories with little crossover. So much about buds comes down to personal preference on how they actually feel when tucked inside your ears. They're aesthetically pleasing in a pale blue that matches my preferred fashion color palette, and I find them to be supremely comfortable. With 30 hours of battery life and decent ANC, they allow me to move through the world in my own little bubble. Once in, they simultaneously feel glued to my head with a tight seal in my ear, while also being so light and comfortable I forget they're there."

My body composition has become about 70 percent egg in the blissful month since I bought this cooker. That in and of itself is a frustration, only compounded by those same products going bad if they’re not stored properly. The Gripstics are a simple solution to this universal problem, and one that I’m certain has paid for itself many times over. So far, it’s helped me do things like solder an HDMI port onto a PS4 and install new batteries on old Game Boy games. I have the four-pack but there’s also an eight-pack and a 12-pack, which might be even more handy. We opted for a cheap $25 option from Amazon that lets you adjust how much foaming soap is dispensed and lasts for a couple of months between charges, but companies like Simplehuman sell pricier $80 versions wrapped in brushed metal or other fancy finishes that could better match your decor. For younger kids, there’s also now a GraviTrax Junior line with simpler components and larger marbles. Older buildings especially suffer from what I can only describe as loose socket syndrome, where those very convenient modern boxy socket extenders with five different USB and USB-C charging ports simply cannot stay in place and fall right out of the wall because they’re too heavy. It takes up extra space in my suitcase but each time has left me feeling vindicated about the purchase."

    "summary": "If your laptop simply isn’t cutting it anymore, Amazon Prime Day 2025 might have arrived just in time. As has been the case for the past few years, laptop deals are abundant this Prime Day, bringing discounts to MacBooks, Windows laptops, Chromebooks and more. But we wouldn’t blame you if you didn’t know how to figure out if that laptop you’re eyeing actually has a good discount for Prime Day, or if the deal is stale.\nThat’s where Engadget can help. We’ve poured over the Prime Day laptop deals available this year to pick out the best ones you can get across all kinds of computers. If you’re super picky about the specs you want in a new laptop, we always recommend going straight to the manufacturer so you can configure the machine exactly to your needs. But if you’re willing to work with premade models, Prime Day deals could help you save some cash on your next laptop. \nPrime Day laptop deals: MacBooks\nApple’s latest laptops are the MacBook Air M4 and the MacBook Pro M4, but the M3-powered machines are still available and great values when you can get them at steep discounts. But for the most future-proof options, we recommend going with the M4 MacBooks. Amazon actually has decent MacBook deals throughout the year, most of the time on the base configurations of any given model. In a welcomed update, Apple recently made all base models of the MacBook Air M4 have 16GB of RAM by default (which is the same as you’ll find on the base-level Pros).\n\n\n\nMacBook Air (15-inch, M4, 16GB RAM, 256GB SSD) for $1,049 ($150 off)\nMacBook Air (15-inch, M3, 24GB RAM, 512GB SSD) for $1,249 (26 percent off)\nMacBook Pro (14-inch, M4, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD) for $1,429 (11 percent off)\n\nPrime day laptop deals: Windows laptops\nYou’ve got a lot of variety to choose from when it comes to Windows laptops, and that can be a blessing or a curse. We recommend looking for a laptop from a reputable brand (i.e. Microsoft, Dell, Acer, Lenovo and others like them), and one that can handle daily work or play pressures. That means at least 8GB of RAM and 245GB of SSD storage, plus the latest Intel or AMD CPUs. If you’re looking for a new gaming laptop, you’ll need a bit more power and a dedicated graphics card to boot. Now is a good time to consider upgrading as well since Windows 10 will be sunset in October this year and Microsoft has recommended users upgrade to newer Windows 11 laptops.\n\n\n\nSamsung Galaxy Book5 360 (Windows 11, Copilot+, 15.6-inch, Intel Core Ultra 7, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD) for $1,050 (22 percent off)\nMicrosoft Surface laptop (Windows 11, Copilot+, 13.8-inch, Snapdragon X Plus) for $880 (27 percent off)\nLenovo V15 G2 laptop (Windows 11 Pro, 15.6-inch, Intel Celeron N4500, 32GB RAM, 1TB SSD) for $429 (28 percent off)\nMicrosoft Surface Pro 2-in-1 (Windows 11, Copilot+, 13-inch, Snapdragon X Plus, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD) for $870 (28 percent off)\nDell Inspiron 3520 laptop (Windows 11, 15.6-inch, Intel Core i5, 8GB RAM, 512GB SSD) for $350 (22 percent off)\nAcer Nitro V gaming laptop (Windows 11, 15.6-inch, Intel Core i5, RTX 4050, 8GB RAM, 512GB SSD) for $650 ($150 off)\nASUS ROG Strix G16 gaming laptop (Windows 11, Intel Core i9, RTX 4060, 16GB RAM, 1TB SSD) for $1,360 ($340 off)\n\nPrime Day laptop deals: Chromebooks\nMost Chromebooks start off pretty affordable, so that just means you can get them for even less during an event like Prime Day. If you’re a Chrome OS lover, it’s also a decent time to check out sales on premium Chromebooks, which can usually cost $500 or more. In general, we recommend looking for at least 4 to 8GB of RAM and at least 128GB of SDD storage in a Chromebook that you plan on using as your daily driver.\n\n\n\nHP Chromebook 14 (14-inch, Intel N100, 8GB RAM, 128GB UFS) for $200 (49 percent off)\nGoogle Pixelbook Go (13-inch, Intel Core M3, 8GB RAM, 64GB storage) for $319 (51 percent off)\nAcer Chromebook Plus 514 (14-inch, Intel Core i3, 8GB RAM, 128GB SSD) for $329 (18 percent off)\nHP Chromebook Plus x360 (14-inch, Intel Core i3, 8GB RAM, 128GB UFS) for $327 (45 percent off)\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/amazon-prime-day-has-the-best-deals-on-laptops-this-week-save-on-macbooks-windows-11-machines-chromebooks-and-others-130057842.html?src=rss",

While there are some (Echos, Kindles) that we like more than others (Fire tablets), there’s no question that you’ll get the best discount on all Amazon tech during Prime Day. The online retail giant typically discounts all of its in-house-made gear for Prime Day, and this year is no different. Here, we’ve collected all of the best Prime Day deals on Amazon gear so you don’t have to go searching for them.\nPrime Day Echo deals\n\n\nEcho Pop speaker for $22 (45 percent off): One of the newer Echo devices available, the Pop it sports a 1.95-inch front-facing speaker and a physical mic mute switch for extra privacy. The Pop also has built-in eero compatibility, so it can extend the area of your home Wi-Fi network if you already have an eero router system. \nEcho Buds for $45 (68 percent off): Amazon's main earbud offering, the Echo Buds are one of our top picks for the best budget wireless earbuds you can get right now. Their design allows some outside sound in, which some will prefer over total noise cancellation, and they have a comfortable design with a pocket-friendly case, automatic wear detection, multi-device connectivity and, of course, built-in Alexa voice controls.\nEcho Show 5 for $60 (33 percent off): This model is one of our favorite smart displays thanks to its compact design, ambient light sensor and sunrise alarm feature, all of which make it an excellent smart alarm clock. Amazon improved the speaker quality on this latest model, which gives sound deeper bass and clearer vocals.\nEcho Show 8 for $110 (27 percent off): This is our current top pick for the best smart display with Amazon’s Alexa thanks in part to its 8-inch touchscreen, 13MP camera that supports auto-framing for better video chats and its built-in Zigbee smart home hub. The 2023 model supports Visual ID, which will show personalized information on the device’s display depending on who’s using it, and video streaming from Netflix, Hulu, Prime Video and other services.\nPrime Day Kindle deals\n\n\nKindle Kids for $95 ($35 off): This is the same device as the base Kindle, but it becomes more kid-friendly thanks to the included cover, two-year warranty and the included year of Amazon Kids+, which gives children ages 3-12 access to hundreds of appropriate ebooks and audiobooks. Just be sure to take note when you activate that subscription because it will renew after one year at the standard $6/month rate.\nKindle Paperwhite for $125 ($35 off): The latest version of the Paperwhite has a seven-inch display, thinner bezels, an adjustable warm light, speedier page turns and a battery that can last up to 12 weeks on a single charge. This model is also IPX8 waterproof and has built-in Audible integration.\nKindle Colorsoft for $180 ($100 off): Amazon's only color e-reader has a seven-inch, high-contrast display, an auto-adjusting front light, a color highlighting feature and an eight-week battery life.\nKindle Scribe for $260 ($140 off): The Scribe is one of the best E-Ink tablets you can buy at the moment, and certainly the top pick if you want a writable table that also excels as an ereader. It provides a great reading and writing experience, thanks in part to its ability to access the entire Kindle ebook library, and it has handy Google Drive, Microsoft OneDrive and Dropbox integration.\nPrime Day Fire TV deals\n\n\nFire TV Stick 4K for $25 (50 percent off): This is the cheapest Fire TV Stick you can get to stream 4K content, plus it has support for Wi-Fi 6 and Dolby Vision and Atmos. With its live picture-in-picture feature, you can view security camera feeds right on your TV while you’re watching your favorite show or movie.\nFire TV Stick 4K Max for $35 (42 percent off): In addition to 4K HDR streaming with Dolby Vision and Atmos support, the 4K Max dongle includes Wi-Fi 6E connectivity, 16GB of built-in storage and live picture-in-picture capabilities. It also supports the Fire TV “ambient experience,” which lets you display photos and images on your TV screen when you’re not actively watching something.\nFire TV Cube streaming box for $90 (36 percent off): This model will provide the best performance of any Fire TV streaming device, and it supports 4K HDR content, Dolby Vision and Atmos and an enhanced version of the Alexa Voice Remote. Along with live picture-in-picture view and the Fire TV ambient experience, you can also hardware other devices to the Fire TV Cube including a cable box or a game console.\nPrime Day Fire tablet deals\n\n\nFire HD 8 tablet for $55 (45 percent off): This is Amazon's most bare-bones tablet, featuring an eight-inch HD touchscreen, hexa-core processor and 13 hours of battery life. The improvements in the screen quality alone from the old-school Fire 7 tablet make it a better buy for most people, and this slab would make a good couch device for general web browsing, email checking, online shopping and more.\nFire Max 11 tablet for $140 (39 percent off): Amazon’s most powerful tablet, the Fire Max 11 sports an 11-inch 2,000 x 1,200 touchscreen, an octa-core processor, up to 128GB of storage and 14 hours of battery life. It also works with a number of optional accessories, including a stylus and keyboard case.\nFire HD 10 Kids tablet for $105 (45 percent off): This slab is designed for kids aged three to seven, with full parental controls plus one year of Amazon Kids+ for free with the tablet purchase. This model has a 10-inch FHD touchscreen, an octa-core processor and 13 hours of battery life, plus it comes with a two-year warranty and a protective case.\nFire HD 10 Kids Pro tablet for $105 (45 percent off): This model is designed for kids aged six to 12 and comes with a slimmer protective case, a two-year warranty and one year of access to Amazon Kids+. Otherwise, you get a very similar experience here that you would with the non-Pro version, including parental controls, a 10-inch touchscreen, solid performance and a 13-hour battery life.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-prime-day-deals-on-amazon-devices-save-up-to-68-percent-on-kindle-ereaders-echo-speakers-and-more-082012114.html?src=rss",

    "full_text": "It's unclear so far how many products in addition to the 1.1 million previously reported are affected. Recently, Southwest Airlines changed its policy on charging devices inside of carry-on bags. Customers can verify their serial number at a webpage provided by Anker. Anker recommends contacting a local hazardous waste collection center versus disposing of it in the trash or through standard recycling services. Most use lithium ion technology, which can be used to make battery-based products lighter and efficient, but is also susceptible to overheating or even fires if the batteries are damaged or have degraded. It's not unlike reports a decade ago of cheap batteries on hoverboards spontaneously combusting. Fountain is currently representing a case involving portable batteries that does not involve Anker. \"I would caution consumers to not store or use these products in a confined or unventilated area that could cause overheating and to not leave these products plugged into home electrical systems for extended periods of time, such as overnight or when on vacation.\" The attorney said that in the case of Anker's recall, customers don't always keep their proof of purchase, though it's not required in this case. \"Most people that have had an overheating event or a small fire will simply throw the unit away before ever thinking about contacting the manufacturer for a recall reimbursement,\" Fountain said."

A Menlo Ventures survey of 5,000 adults found that this \"default tool dynamic\" means most people using AI have chosen a general AI tool they'll try first for every job, even if it's not necessarily the best tool for the job. In the report, ChatGPT is the AI assistant that tops default tools, with 28% of respondents choosing it first. It's followed by Google's Gemini at 23%, Meta AI and Amazon's Alexa, both at 18% and Apple's Siri at 16%. Other tools including Claude, Grok and Perplexity collectively make up another 33%. Some of the most common ways people are using these AI tools include composing emails and other writing support, researching topics of interest and managing to-do lists, according to Menlo Ventures. Some of that, Menlo Ventures says, is \"first-mover advantage,\" with tools like ChatGPT having built up a following by being the first to offer some chatbot and image-generation features. But, the company warns, \"that position is not guaranteed,\" with challengers moving fast. \"The consumer market for [large language models] is still nascent and far from saturated,\" the report says, \"leaving ample room for product innovation to shift market share over time.\" Overall, 61% of Americans have used AI in the last six months and nearly 1 in 5, 19%, rely on it daily, the report says."

McDonald's Snack Wraps, a chicken-tortilla entree that's been missing from US locations of the Golden Arches, returns to the huge fast-food chain on Thursday at 10:30 a.m. local time (if you want to be the first in line). On Tuesday, I tried out the very similar chicken snack wraps at Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen, another fast-food franchise that's jumped on the snack wrap bandwagon. In fact, it was Popeyes' announcement of their own snack wraps that possibly nudged McDonald's to announce Thursday as its own release. Chicken is Popeyes' specialty, so it remains to be seen if McDonald's can compete. There are different versions, but the basic one includes white-meat chicken strips known as McCrispy Strips wrapped in a flour tortilla with cheese and lettuce with either ranch, honey mustard or salsa. Zach Ciampa, who regularly covers new food releases under the social-media handle Snach With Zach, said there's been an intense fan base out there for the wraps. \"Regarding McDonald's Snack Wrap, it's by far the most requested item I've ever seen my audience ask or demand to come back,\" he told CNET. Ciampa said the only similar fast-food items that come close to the same level of interest are Dairy Queen's S'mores Blizzard and Taco Bell's Caramel Apple Empanada, both of which have made recent returns. Price: Snack Wraps are priced at $3 apiece."

It'll tuck away behind your set nicely and it supports headphone mode, which lets you connect headphones to the Roku mobile app for private listening and viewing from your TV.\nRazer Kraken Hello Kitty & Friends Bluetooth headset for $47 (47 percent off): Razer makes excellent gaming accessories and this Hello Kitty & Friends version of the popular Kraken headset might be just what you were looking for to add more personality into your Twitch stream outfits. Aside from the cute design, it supports Bluetooth 5.0, comes with 40mm drivers and sports a beamforming microphone.\nGoogle TV Streamer 4K for $84 ($16 off): Our top favorite streaming device, the Google TV Streamer 4K is basically a souped-up Chromecast with 4K content support, an easy to use interface and a great remote control.\nSamsung Galaxy Watch 6 for $129 (47 percent off): While it's an older model, we generally like Samsung Galaxy Watches and they're arguably the best smartwatches for Samsung phone users. The Galaxy Watch 6 has good all-day activity tracking and sleep monitoring, plus heart rate tracking, personalized health insights and more.\nSamsung 32-inch Smart Monitor M5 for $199 ($100 off): Not only will this be a good monitor for your home office setup, but it also acts as a full smart TV, too. Its interface gives you access to platforms like Netflix, Prime Video, YouTube and others, and it also comes with a SmartThings IoT hub built in so you can connect and control things like smart lights directly from the monitor.\nSony WH-1000XM5 headphones for $296 ($104 off): While the XM6 headphones are the latest and greatest, they only make small changes to the already stellar XM5. These were our top pick for the best wireless headphones for a long time before the XM6 launched earlier this year, and we still like them for their excellent sound quality, strong ANC, multi-device connectivity and good battery life.\nHisense 75-inch U6H ULED 4K smart TV for $448 (36 percent off): This Quantum Dot TV can reach 600 nits at peak brightness across its 48 local dimming zones. It supports Dolby Vision and Atmos, HDMI 2.1 inputs for a better gaming experience and it has the Google Assistant built in for voice control.\nPlayStation 5 Slim Astro Bot bundle for $453 ($106 off): This version of the console has a disc drive and comes with 1TB of storage, plus the ever-popular Astro Bot game.\nApple MacBook Air (13-inch, M1) for $599 ($50 off): The M1 Air has been long gone from Apple's own site, but it's still a more than capable laptop for anyone looking for a solid, all-purpose machine. We still recommend springing for an M3 or M4 machine instead, but if you're on a budget, this deal will be hard to beat.\nMSI Thin A15 gaming laptop (15.6-inch, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD) for $649 (37 percent off): Along with a Ryzen processor, this MSI gaming laptop sports a NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060 GPU and a 144Hz screen, and it comes in at just about 4 pounds in weight.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/walmart-deals-2025-rivals-prime-day-with-sales-up-to-47-percent-off-230146367.html?src=rss",

    "full_text": "California State Senator Scott Wiener on Wednesday introduced new amendments to his latest bill, SB 53, that would require the world’s largest AI companies to publish safety and security protocols and issue reports when safety incidents occur. California’s governor then called for a group of AI leaders — including the leading Stanford researcher and co-founder of World Labs, Fei-Fei Li — to form a policy group and set goals for the state’s AI safety efforts. California’s AI policy group recently published their final recommendations, citing a need for “requirements on industry to publish information about their systems” in order to establish a “robust and transparent evidence environment.” Senator Wiener’s office said in a press release that SB 53’s amendments were heavily influenced by this report. SB 53 aims to strike a balance that Governor Newsom claimed SB 1047 failed to achieve — ideally, creating meaningful transparency requirements for the largest AI developers without thwarting the rapid growth of California’s AI industry. “Congress should be leading, demanding transparency and accountability from the companies building frontier models. But with no serious federal action in sight, states must step up. California’s SB 53 is a thoughtful, well-structured example of state leadership.” OpenAI also decided not to publish a safety report for its GPT-4.1 model. Later, a third-party study came out that suggested it may be less aligned than previous AI models. For now, they’ll be watching closely as Senator Wiener once again tests those boundaries."

    "summary": "If you’ve been holding out on a new set of earbuds or headphones during Prime Day, now’s a great time to take a look at the deals. While Sony and Bose are typically among our favorites each year, there are a number of options available at discounted prices right now. Whether you prefer over-ear headphones or true wireless earbuds, the list of deals accounts for both styles and includes a range of prices. Plus, we’ll guide you through the fray with the best features of each model so you’re not left sorting out the spec sheet by yourself. All of the deals below are still available at time of publish.\nPrime Day Sony deals\n\n\nSony WH-1000XM6 headphones for $430 ($20 off): Sony's latest flagship headphones have only been out a few months and we're already seeing a small discount on them. These are my top pick in our headphones guide for the combination of advanced features, comfy fit, great sound and improved active noise cancellation (ANC).  \nSony ULT Wear headphones for $130 ($70 off): If you're after a solid set of Sony cans but don't want to splurge for the 1000X line, the ULT Wear is a good option. There are a bunch of handy features and robust sound with ULT bass boost.\nSony WH-CH720N headphones for $80 ($70 off): The cheapest Sony headphones we'd recommend for Prime Day are no slouch. They're lightweight and comfy with respectable sound for the price. You also get Adaptive Sound Control, 360 Reality Audio and multipoint Bluetooth on this budget model. \nSony WF-1000XM5 earbuds for $200 ($100 off): My top pick for best earbuds is also on sale for Prime Day. No other company comes close to the list of features Sony offers here, and that's on top of excellent sound, improved fit and effective ANC. \nSony LinkBud Fit earbuds for $130 ($70 off): Sony's much smaller earbuds offer big sound and a lot of features for less than the 1000X model. These are a big improvement over the company's LinkBuds S, which were already a low-key hit for affordable earbuds.\nSony WF-CH710N earbuds for $80 ($40 off): The CH710N is still quite new, but the earbuds are a steal at $80 for Prime Day. The compact, comfy design is a highlight, as are all the features Sony managed to pack in. Plus, they're available in a lovely transparent blue that allows you to see all of the internal components. \nSonos Prime Day deals\n\n\nPrime Day Bose deals (also available at Bose.com)\n\n\nBose QuietComfort Earbuds for $129 (28 percent off): The best Bose earbuds for most people are getting a decent discount this week. This model gives you the company's powerful ANC and great sound for less than flagship prices. You also get spatial audio and dependable battery life in this affordable option.\nBose Ultra Open Earbuds for $199 (33 percent off): If you thought Bose's clip-on open earbuds were a bit too pricey to splurge on, now's your chance to get them for less. And two colors are available at an even bigger discount than the rest, putting this set just under $200. Plus, this model works with the company's soundbars for an enhanced living room listening experience. \nBeats Prime Day deals\n\n\nBeats Solo 4 headphones for $98 (50 percent off): Beats' popular on-ear headphones are half off for Prime Day, which makes them a great deal for fans of that wear style. While they may look similar to their predecessor, the Solo 4 have improved sound and longer battery life compared to that older model.\nBeats Powerbeats Pro 2 earbuds for $180 (28 percent off): Apple's first earbuds with heart rate tracking are slightly discounted for Prime Day. This your chance to try the tech without paying full price. What's more, the Powerbeats Pro 2 have an improved design, the smarts of Apple's H2 chip and powerful bass. \nPrime Day Samsung deals\n\n\nSamsung Galaxy Buds FE for $52 (48 percent off): Samsung's budget earbuds are solid option if you're looking to spend less than $60. Like the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro, these are best-suited for Samsung devices where you'll find features like live translation and automatic switching.\nApple and Google Prime Day deals\n\n\nApple AirPods 4 for $89 (31 percent off): The redesigned \"regular\" AirPods that debuted last year are currently available well below their normal $129 price tag. Here, you'll get the new, more comfortable shape as well as updated features. \nApple AirPods 4 with ANC for $119 (34 percent off): And if you need some ANC to go with your AirPods, but don't want to go for the Pro 2, here's your best bet. These retain the open-style fit of regular AirPods but add surprisingly effective ANC to the mix. \nApple AirPods Max (USB-C) for $430 (22 percent off): Apple's over-ear headphones are $119 off during Prime Day, which softens the blow to your wallet for this pricey set. They're comfy and offer a lot of handy features for Apple devices. Plus, you can unlock lossless listening with a wired connection. \nGoogle Pixel Buds Pro 2 for $160 (30 percent off): The best earbuds for Pixel phone users are down to $160, which makes them a great purchase right now. Live translate and hands-free access to Gemini might be the highlight, but these earbuds have great sound and capable ANC too. \nPrime Day deals on Dyson\nDyson OnTrac headphones for $300 (40 percent off): This set isn't without its flaws, but I can understand why you'd be drawn to the almost infinitely customizable design and long battery life. There's also real-time hearing health features and the sound is crisp and clear even though it lacks depth and immersion. \nJBL Prime Day deals\nJBL Tour One M2 headphones for $150 (50 percent off): The biggest discount on JBL headphones or earbuds comes on the flagship over-hear Tour One M2. These ANC headphones have Smart Ambient sound, Smart Talk automatic pausing and other advanced features. \nJBL Live Beam 3 for $150 (25 percent off): If you're looking for a discounted way to get your hands on JBL's touchscreen earbud case, the Live Beam 3 is your chance. In addition to the fancy case, you'll get up to 12 hours of use on a charge, adaptive ANC and high-res audio compatibility. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/prime-day-2025-the-best-headphone-and-earbud-deals-available-right-now-082347495.html?src=rss",

    "full_text": "July's full moon -- known as the Buck Moon or the Thunder Moon -- will light up the night sky on July 10 and be at its fullest going into July 11. It'll be bright for the whole night, but will reach peak luminosity at around 4:37 a.m. local time, which is a bit late (or early) for most skygazers. Should you not be able to see the moon due to weather or some other reason, you can also soak up a great view anytime between July 9 and July 12 as the moon will be more than 95% full during those days. These names typically come from Native American and colonial times, and were used to describe the moon for the entire month, not just when it's full. Thunderstorms are also common in July, which is why it's called the Thunder Moon. The other two names are less common, but July marks the time when some species of salmon begin migrating for the mating season, while ducks engage in their annual moulting around this time of year as well. Mars will be visible just after sunset in the western sky before setting. You won't have long, since it's scheduled to dip below the horizon before midnight. If you choose to stay up late, Venus will crest the eastern horizon shortly after 2 a.m. local time and be visible until sunrise. Once the moon finishes its monthly cycle, skygazers can check out the Alpha Capricornids and Southern Delta Aquariids meteor showers, both of which are scheduled to peak during the last few days of July."

    "full_text": "OpenAI is working on an AI-powered web browser that could make its debut in the coming weeks, according to a report from Reuters on Wednesday. Google Chrome is the world's most popular web browser, with a global market share of 68%, according to Statista. Gen AI technology has been reshaping people's experience of the web over the last two years. An OpenAI web browser would likely accelerate that process while also giving OpenAI more direct access to user data. (Disclosure: Ziff Davis, CNET's parent company, in April filed a lawsuit against OpenAI, alleging it infringed Ziff Davis copyrights in training and operating its AI systems.) Chrome gives Google insight into user behavior across the web, which helps the company better understand user preferences to then sell advertising. Google search is also the default search engine on Chrome, further cementing Google's dominance. Other web browsers such as Firefox, Opera and Brave advertise themselves as more privacy focused, with features like tracking protection, built-in VPNs and ad-blocking, but all have only managed low single-digit percentages in market share. The US Department of Justice is advocating for a forced sale of Chrome after a judge ruled last August that Google was operating an illegal monopoly in the search engine market. OpenAI, Perplexity AI and Yahoo had all expressed interest in buying Chrome."

    "full_text": "In Brief Though he officially left the U.S. government in May, Steve Davis — Elon Musk’s low-flying former top lieutenant at the Department of Government Efficiency — continues to wield influence at DOGE, according to the WSJ. The outlet says Davis, a longtime Musk ally, regularly gives directions to current DOGE officials and has privately dismissed his departure as “fake news.” TechCrunch reached out earlier Wednesday to The Boring Company, Musk’s tunneling company where Davis has held the president role, for comment. This behind-the-scenes involvement suggests that Davis — who is reportedly so frugal that he has sometimes signed off on costs as low as a few hundred dollars, and so loyal to Musk that he reportedly slept in the offices of X with his wife and newborn child after Musk took over the social media platform — remains more engaged than outsiders might realize. Given Musk’s exit and his ongoing feud with President Trump, Davis’s influence has created internal tension, adds the Journal, with staffers reportedly facing loyalty tests between Trump and Musk in closed meetings as the department battles White House efforts to shrink its power. The outlet cites current and former officials who say Musk allies want to establish “DOGE 2.0,” focusing on government IT systems rather than job cuts, but adds there are critics who believe the team’s continued involvement serves primarily to benefit Musk’s business interests, including SpaceX, Tesla, and X."

In a letter to the Federal Communications Commission, the telecom said that it \"is ending its DEI-related policies [...] not just in name, but in substance.\"\nT-Mobile conveniently waited to dismantle its DEI efforts until it was awaiting FCC approval for two major deals. The company needs regulatory backing to purchase extensive assets from United States Cellular in a deal valued at $4.4 billion. It's also looking to establish a joint venture with investment firm KKR that will acquire internet provider Metronet.\nReuters reported that FCC Chair Brendan Carr reacted positively to this change in a text message to the publication: \"This is another good step forward for equal opportunity, nondiscrimination and the public interest.\" Carr was appointed to the top spot at the FCC by President Donald Trump.

    "full_text": "T-Mobile has abandoned all of its programs for diversity, equity and inclusion. In a letter to the Federal Communications Commission, the telecom said that it \"is ending its DEI-related policies [...] not just in name, but in substance.\" T-Mobile conveniently waited to dismantle its DEI efforts until it was awaiting FCC approval for two major deals. The company needs regulatory backing to purchase extensive assets from United States Cellular in a deal valued at $4.4 billion. It's also looking to establish a joint venture with investment firm KKR that will acquire internet provider Metronet. Reuters reported that FCC Chair Brendan Carr reacted positively to this change in a text message to the publication: \"This is another good step forward for equal opportunity, nondiscrimination and the public interest.\" Carr was appointed to the top spot at the FCC by President Donald Trump. One of the remaining democratic commissioners at the agency, Anna M. Gomez, was more scathing of T-Mobile's \"cynical\" reversal of its policies.

    "full_text": "Students couldn’t log in to the platform where professors post assignments and course materials. During that time, the personal data of at least every person who applied to Columbia between 2019 and 2024 was stolen. Bloomberg confirmed details of the Columbia data it received with eight current and former students; they were accurate. For those of us keeping score at home, that’s two stories about the hack and its overall political implications, both of which are less informative than Bloomberg; one story using hacked data to smear a mayoral candidate; and two stories jerking off. The Times identifies Jordan Lasker as the source of Mamdani’s college application (though bafflingly only by his internet alias “Crémieux”), and he likely has some idea about where he got it from. Maybe we will see some impressive reporting shortly and someone is chasing it right now. Journalists have long struggled over balancing newsworthiness and sourcing — the 2014 North Korean hack of Sony Pictures produced a spectacular revelation about Hollywood’s war on Google, but also gossip intended to humiliate Amy Pascal, where reporters played along and effectively did Kim Jong Un’s bidding. In justifying the coverage decisions around leaked materials, there was a common thread: Hackers don’t make journalistic assignments. Trump’s ICE has targeted student protesters, disappearing them into faraway facilities. In fact, speaking of journalistic ethics: even though journalism does not have one single body that upholds professional ethics, The Columbia Journalism Review — housed at Columbia University, alongside a renowned journalism school and the prestigious Pulitzer Prizes — is widely acknowledged as a leading institution in setting and guiding norms in the profession."

It would also have required companies to display when promotional offers or free trials would end and make it as easy to cancel your membership as it is to sign up for one. The court's decision comes after a recent CNET survey found that subscribers are paying an average of $1,080 and wasting $200 per year on unwanted subscriptions. You can identify unwanted subscriptions by combing through your bank account and credit card statements from the past month and looking for recurring charges.

Marshall is a British audio hardware company that got its start back in the early '60s and became renowned for producing things like amps and speakers for live music performances. CNET Deals texts are free, easy and save you money. They've also brought their signature sound and style to headphones. Marshall boasts that these headphones can last up to 100 hours on one charge, an almost ludicrous number that has largely held up as I've use them. Vocals can sometimes come off a little shabby at first blush, but I find you get used to it real quick. For such a cheap set of headphones, the Major V easily maintains connections to at least two devices at a time and can switch between them almost seamlessly. It's a strong contender overall in the budget Bluetooth headphones space. They usually retail for around $160, making their current price a 38% discount. While I was able to get this deal well in advance of Prime Day, there's no telling how long it'll stick around, so get a move on if you're interested in picking a pair up."

There were hints that Yaccarino was working behind the scenes to repair things, though. In August 2023, Yaccarino claimed that X’s operational run rate was close to “break even.” The social network was already on track for a nearly 55% year-over-year decline in worldwide ad spending, according to eMarketer estimates, and this boycott threatened to worsen the situation further. Musk had also been a challenge for Yaccarino during her time with the company. During Yaccarino’s time, X also made moves to ensure more brand safety, partnering with adtech companies DoubleVerify and Integral Ad Science (IAS) to warn them if ads were placed around inappropriate content. It also offered brands tools to adjust the sensitivity of where their ads were displayed on the app, where more “relaxed” ad slots would cost less, and those with higher safety concerns would pay more. None of this has stopped X from being a controversial platform with regard to ad safety."

Fast forward two months and it's now $500 at Costco, making it the the cheapest Copilot Plus PC I've seen -- and a great value. It features the latest Intel Core Ultra Series 2 processor (codenamed Lunar Lake) that serves up competitive application and AI performance along with great battery life and a design that doesn't look all that different from Acer's pricier Swift laptops. Thanks to its Intel Core Ultra 5 CPU that has a neural processing unit capable of 40 trillion operations per second, the Aspire 14 AI hits the minimum requirement for Microsoft's Copilot Plus PC platform. Its AI processor can offload AI workloads -- constantly taking Windows Recall snapshots, blurring backgrounds for video calls and producing live translations -- to its NPU, keeping the CPU and GPU freed up for whatever primary task you're working on. You need to be careful when shopping for a low-cost laptop because many offerings are older models with previous-generation components that are discounted in an attempt to clear out inventory for newer units. Its integrated Intel GPU doesn't provide much in the way of 3D gaming but the same can be said for any Copilot Plus PC, since I've yet to encounter one with dedicated graphics. It's a solidly constructed laptop, and you'd have to look closely to tell it apart from one of Acer's mainstream Swift laptops. And the efficient Intel Core Ultra CPU also allows the Aspire 14 AI to run for almost 19 hours on a single charge while also offering a bit of future-proofing with its AI capabilities. Plus, both offer even better battery life than the Aspire 14 AI."

    "summary": "If you're interested in getting your first robot vacuum to help automate a chore around the house, Prime Day deals have come in clutch this year. One of our favorite robot vacuums from Eufy, the 11S Max, has dropped to $140 for Prime Day. That's a whopping half off its original price and one of the best sales we've seen on this model.\nThis model earned a top spot on our list of the best budget-friendly robot vacuums. Arguably the coolest feature here is the 11S Max's thin profile, which allows it to slide under short tables and other places typical robovacs are too chonky to reach. It's also extremely quiet during use, so it can be operated at night without waking everyone up. \n\n\nIt runs for around 100 minutes per charge and it'll head to the outlet on its own for some juice. The vacuum automatically adapts suction power to suit different floor types. We found the obstacle avoidance here to be excellent, thanks to an included infrared sensor. It also ships with a remote control for those who want to ensure certain parts of the home get extra attention.\nThis is a budget robovac, so there are some tradeoffs. First of all, it doesn't connect to WiFi and there's no affiliated app. It doesn't really need it, as the obstacle avoidance tech gets the job done, but this does mean that owners can't set schedules or create maps with no-go zones.\nFinally, it's just a vacuum. There's no mop here and it doesn't ship with a debris canister. It'll have to get emptied after every use. Still, the price is certainly right.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/this-eufy-robot-vacuum-is-half-off-for-prime-day-153859066.html?src=rss",

The only real downside is that it only has one HDMI port, which means you won't be able to directly connect a gaming console. It also means that older TVS with an optical jack will require an adapter.\nThe Sonos Ray soundbar is also on sale for $169, which is a discount of around $30. This one also made our list of the best soundbars and we particularly enjoyed the budget-friendly price and easy setup. We said it \"nailed the basics\" in our official review.\nNow onto more traditional speakers. The Sonos Era 100 smart speaker is on sale for $179, which is a discount of $20. This is a voice-activated speaker with stellar sound quality. The Roam 2 portable Bluetooth speaker is down to $143 from $179, which is a great deal.

We appreciated the Galaxy Watch 7 in our official review, calling it a \"capable companion for Samsung phones.\" It features an old-school design that recalls classic timepieces and not modern smart devices. \n\n\nThe performance is zippy, thanks to an upgraded processor, and the storage has doubled when compared to its predecessor. There are also many more sensors when measured against the Galaxy Watch 6. For instance, there are now 13 heart rate sensor LEDs. This leads to the ability to assess more complex health metrics, like sleep apnea detection. All of this is data viewable via the fun and intuitive Samsung Health app.\nWe also appreciated that this watch will automatically track workouts when you start, without asking if you're exercising like with the Apple Watch. There are even some AI-assisted tools here that offer light coaching as you workout or engage in physical activities.\nThere are a couple of little quirks here. First of all, this watch is primarily for those already tied into Samsung's ecosystem. If you use an iPhone, this might not be the best match. Also, the always-on display is a notorious battery hog. Still, this is a lot of smartwatch for the money.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-samsung-galaxy-watch-7-drops-to-a-record-low-price-for-prime-day-110001063.html?src=rss",

Samsung and other smartphone makers can add their own software features on top of Android. But I am reporter, so the transcript and interpreter features are particularly handy. I jumped on an impromptu call with my co-worker Corin Cesaric to test if these transcript features would activate. Apart from Note Assist, all of them were turned on in the settings. Turns out, it comes down to which apps you set as default when setting up your device. The bicameral nature of Samsung devices running Google's operating system is to blame for all this confusion. Many Samsung and Google apps have the exact same names, making this issue even more confusing. Otherwise consumers will simply conclude that Samsung, OnePlus or Motorola are to blame."

    "full_text": "It looks like time has run out for the nearly 8 million student loan borrowers enrolled in SAVE. The US Department of Education announced that loans will resume accruing interest on Aug. 1. Borrowers enrolled in the Saving on a Valuable Education Plan, a product of the Biden administration, have been in limbo since June 2024, when Republican opponents challenged the plan and later struck down by a federal court. Since then, borrowers have had their loans placed in forbearance, with payments on pause and interest rates left at 0%. Payments are still on pause while borrowers remain in a general forbearance, but interest will start accruing again -- although not retroactively, the department noted. \"The Department urges all borrowers in the SAVE Plan to quickly transition to a legally compliant repayment plan -- such as the Income-Based Repayment Plan,\" Secretary of Education Linda McMahon said in a statement. The Department of Education's website previously stated that SAVE borrowers will stay in a general forbearance until at least September. We recommend you start investigating other available income-driven repayment plans; you can use the department's loan simulator to find out how much your payment could be. You aren't required to start making payments or choose a repayment plan on Aug. 1, but your loans will start accruing interest at that point. Borrowers enrolled in the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program who have already reached their required 120 on-time payments and are waiting for their forgiveness or PSLF buy-back application to get approved can either continue to ride out the forbearance period or switch to IBR, said Betsy Mayotte, president and founder of the Institute of Student Loan Advisors."

It works with most Android phones, the iPhone 15 and 16 series and the two newest iPad mini models. You can plug into some foldables, including the Galaxy Z Fold 5. Ditto for most Android tablets (up to 8 inches in size). It even works with PCs via a low-latency USB cable.\nThe list goes on. It has advanced haptics. You have RGB lighting... if you're into that. (This is Razer, after all.) Its ABXY buttons and D-pad are mechanical. It has Hall effect triggers, programmable L4 / R4 bumpers and plenty of customization options via the Razer Nexus app.\nIf we have a gripe, it's that the thumbsticks aren't Hall effect. (Then again, the Switch 2 doesn't, either.) But at $100 for Prime Day, that omission is much easier to forgive.

The ChatGPT maker reportedly aims to release its browser in the coming weeks. Much like Perplexity’s Comet and The Browser Company’s Dia, OpenAI’s browser is said to use AI to rethink how users browse the web. Supposedly, the browser keeps some user interactions inside ChatGPT instead of linking out to websites. Reuters reports that OpenAI’s browser may integrate Operator, the company’s web-browsing AI agent, as a key feature. OpenAI had considered building a browser to compete with Google Chrome in 2024, according to The Information. Much like Perplexity, OpenAI likely wants to get direct access to user data and have the freedom to create novel user experiences that aren’t intermediated by Google."

    "summary": "Apple is planning to release the first refresh of the Vision Pro headset, according to reporting by Bloomberg. Industry analyst Mark Gurman suggests that the updated gadget could come as early as this year.\nThe reporting indicates that the new headset will include a faster processor and components that are better suited for running AI tools. It will also reportedly feature a new strap that's easier to wear for long periods of time. The increased specs are a no-brainer because the primary processor in the original Vision Pro is the M2 chip and Apple recently released the M4.\nThe upgraded strap is a welcome change for most users. This thing was advertised as a replacement for desktop computing and long-term comfort has always been a sticking point here. Eight hours is a long time to sit with your head being weighed down like an anvil.\nTo that end, Gurman says that Apple is working on another redesigned model that significantly reduces the weight of the headset. This one is rumored to come out in 2027.\nDespite the welcome hardware changes, there's still the high-priced elephant in the room. The Apple Vision Pro has struggled to entice consumers because it costs $3,500. It really doesn't matter how beefed up the new version is if that sticker price remains so exorbitant. If Apple doesn't figure out a way to sell this headset for much cheaper, it will remain a niche device. It's long been speculated that Apple is prepping a more budget-friendly headset, likely priced in the $1,500 to $2,000 range.\n\nWe do know for certain that Apple is prepping a new operating system for the device, called visionOS 26. This will include virtual widgets and offer the ability for eye-scrolling. The OS is coming later this year, so maybe it will accompany the rumored hardware refresh. Reports also suggest that Apple is working on a tethered headset for enterprise applications and smart glasses.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/apples-next-vision-pro-will-reportedly-have-an-m4-chip-and-a-better-head-strap-184352374.html?src=rss",

The S25 Edge is just 0.23 inches (5..8mm) thick, with a titanium frame, IP68 water and dust resistance and a Gorilla Glass Ceramic 2 panel covering its OLED screen. The phone is also fast and performant, with a Snapdragon 8 Elite chip, 12GB of RAM and either 256GB or 512GB of storage. Really, the main ways the S25 Edge is a compromise are in the omissions Samsung made to keep it slim and light. \n\n\nFor example, the S25 Edge doesn't have a telephoto lens, so zoomed in photographs have to happen entirely digitally. The phone also has a noticeably smaller battery at 3,900 mAh, which in our tests meant the phone lasted for a little over 25 hours on a single charge, shorter than both the base S25 and the S25 Ultra. Samsung also cut corners with wireless charging. The S25 Edge is \"Qi2 ready\" but doesn't actually include the magnetic coils necessary to take advantage of the charging standard's main features. Instead, if you want to wirelessly charge the S25 Edge at Qi2 speeds, you need to put it in a case, taking away some of its thinness in the process.\nFor $300 off, those compromises could be very easy to set aside, though. In Engadget's review of the Galaxy S25 Edge, the phone made the most sense as a way to make Samsung's mid-tier phones interesting. It costs the same $1,100 as the Samsung Galaxy S25+ and features many of the same components, but looks and feels different to use. At $785, the Galaxy S25 Edge is now the same price as the base S25 was at launch, and an even more compelling purchase.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/get-315-off-the-samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-for-prime-day-104557485.html?src=rss",

But the claims that the app is secure, however, are already facing scrutiny by security researchers, given that the app and its code have not been reviewed or tested for security issues at all — by Dorsey’s own admission. Since launching, Dorsey has added a warning to Bitchat’s GitHub page: “This software has not received external security review and may contain vulnerabilities and does not necessarily meet its stated security goals. This latest disclaimer came after security researcher Alex Radocea found that it’s possible to impersonate someone else and trick a person’s contacts into thinking they are talking to the legitimate contact, as the researcher explained in a blog post. Save $450 on your TechCrunch All Stage pass Build smarter. Radocea wrote that Bitchat has a “broken identity authentication/verification” system that allows an attacker to intercept someone’s “identity key” and “peer id pair” — essentially a digital handshake that is supposed to establish a trusted connection between two people using the app. Bitchat calls these “Favorite” contacts and marks them with a star icon. Radocea warned that Bitchat users should not trust the app yet. “Security is a great feature to have for going viral. “There are people out there that would take the messaging around security literally and could rely on it for their safety, so the project in its current state could endanger them.”"

Other July arrivals include the Half-Life-esque Abiotic Factor and the banana republic sim Tropico 6.\nHad Cyberpunk 2077 launched in its current state, it may have been a 2020 Game of the Year candidate. Alas, that wasn't the case. It arrived as a buggy mess, including characters rocking the fashion-forward \"penis outside the pants\" look.\nBut CD Project Red weathered the (self-inflicted) storm and pushed update after update to fix it. What you get today is a damn good game. Explore the dystopian sci-fi world of Night City as the mercenary V. Take on jobs, level up and upgrade your bodily augmentations. All dongs are now safely stashed inside the pants.\nPS Plus Premium and Extra members can play Cyberpunk 2077 today. Although the Game Catalog only includes the base game, you can save 30 percent on the Phantom Liberty expansion until July 23. That should help whet your appetite for the game's sequel, which recently entered pre-production.\nDeep Field Games / Playstack\nMeanwhile, Abiotic Factor is less like a modern-day Half-Life and more like an indie love letter to the first entry from 1998. Enter a network of underground research laboratories where strange paranormal stuff is happening. (Sound familiar?) Craft weapons from everyday objects, cook up some monsters and investigate the chaos.\nAll the while, manage your bathroom breaks (as one does). Developer Deep Field Games leans into the humor, including the ability to customize your character's pocket protector.\nThe game combines a late '90s throwback visual style with tight combat controls. You can play solo or with up to five friends. It's been in Steam Early Access for over a year where it's received \"overwhelmingly positive\" reviews. Abiotic Factor arrives in the PS Plus Game Catalog on July 22, its release date.\n\nSpeaking of games with cheeky humor, you can soon step into the polished boots of El Presidente in Tropico 6. Also on tap this month: Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden, Risk of Rain 2 and Planet Zoo. Meanwhile, Premium members get a couple of old-school classics in Twisted Metal 3 and 4. They all arrive on July 15.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/cyberpunk-2077-heads-up-julys-ps-plus-game-catalog-additions-182843496.html?src=rss",
    "full_text": "Years after its botched release, the now-polished Cyberpunk 2077 is now in Sony's Game Catalog. Had Cyberpunk 2077 launched in its current state, it may have been a 2020 Game of the Year candidate. PS Plus Premium and Extra members can play Cyberpunk 2077 today. That should help whet your appetite for the game's sequel, which recently entered pre-production. Enter a network of underground research laboratories where strange paranormal stuff is happening. Craft weapons from everyday objects, cook up some monsters and investigate the chaos. All the while, manage your bathroom breaks (as one does). The game combines a late '90s throwback visual style with tight combat controls. Abiotic Factor arrives in the PS Plus Game Catalog on July 22, its release date. Meanwhile, Premium members get a couple of old-school classics in Twisted Metal 3 and 4."

    "full_text": "In four weeks of usage, I've found it to be the best value for money among Apple's lineup. It's also our go-to for the best cheap desktop alternative to a MacBook or iMac. That's close to the lowest price we've seen on this powerful computer. The M4 Mac Mini plus Apple's current crop of USB-C Magic accessories makes for really nice portable computing solution. Based on my lifestyle, I should be recommending the M4 MacBook Air. You likely won't be able to find similar reliability and power on a Windows machine for $500. The M4 Mac Mini can be equally excellent for both home office and content creation needs. As CNET's Goldman wrote in his review, \"The Mini can fit in your hand and be everything from an everyday home office computer to a full-on professional content-creation machine -- and an easily portable one at that -- with support for up to three 6K-resolution displays.\" The small Apple computer offers a superb value proposition for remote workers and content creators alike. And if this desktop isn't up to your tastes, you can check out the best laptop deals."

Or for a more complex model with extra buttons, the Aerox 5 mouse is discounted to below $100. Gamers who want to save more money and stick with always-reliable wired mice should take a look at the SteelSeries Rival 5, now discounted by $20 and down to $40, with its 18,000 CPI TrueMove Air optical sensor.

A $50 speaker designed to look like an old radio is on sale now under the name NATTBAD, and a table speaker named BLOMPRAKT with atmospheric lighting is coming in October. Technical details are sparse, but the announcement describes support for features like multi-speaker setup and Spotify Tap. This would mark the first introduction of new speakers from IKEA since the company ended its partnership with Sonos earlier this summer. IKEA says more updates about the new range of smart home products will come ahead of the January launch. If you buy something through a link in this article, we may earn commission."

Because Nest's Eco modes are so effective, my Nest smart thermostat is set to pay for itself this summer through electricity savings -- and I barely had to do anything except set it up. Read more: One Tiny Gadget Is the Unsung Hero of Today's Smart, Energy-Saving Home Nest's Eco Modes also generate reports so I can see monthly progress and note any sudden problems or unexpected energy use. Sensors like these help thermostats be more accurate based on where you actually spend time. The Nest thermostat smart home integrations are very limited, but that does make it easier to set up. Many energy providers will also offer bonuses or rebates you can use to recoup the cost of an expensive thermostat even faster. I've even seen it available with rebates and free installation to speed up that payoff date. The bright green leaf icon always shows instant savings for those who don't want to dive too deep into app management."

    "summary": "Shark robot vacuums are on sale for Prime Day and there are some good deals to be had. For instance, the AI Ultra is on sale for just $298. This is 50 percent off, as the regular price is $599.\nThis is a version of the model topped our list of the best robot vacuums, so it's the real deal. The AI Ultra boasts fantastic suction power and the bagless self-emptying base is incredibly handy. There's a simple mobile app that lets users control the vacuum when not at home. This app also displays home maps made by the vacuum that can be edited to create \"no-go\" zones. \n\n\nThe battery life is decent, at 120 minutes per charge. Like most modern robovacs, it'll head back to the power outlet on its own. During use, we found that the vacuum did a pretty good job at avoiding obstacles and managed to sidestep the many cat toys strewn across the floor.\nMany other Shark products are also on sale right now. This includes other robovacs, but also standard upright designs. Here are some of the highlights.\n\nShark AV2501S AI Ultra robot vacuum for $280 (49 percent off): A version of our favorite robot vacuum, this Shark machine has strong suction power and won't choke at the first sight of pet hair or big dust bunnies. Its self-emptying base is bagless as well, which means you won't have to buy propriety bags to refill it with over time. This auto-empty base has a 30-day capacity.\nShark PowerDetect NeverTouch Pro robot vacuum and mop for $700 (42 percent off): This Shark machine is one of our favorites in part because it truly lives up to its name. Thanks to its self-emptying dock that handles vacuumed debris along with clean and dirty mopping water, you really don't have to touch the thing for at least 30 days in between cleanings. We found it to be a solid autonomous dirt sucker, and its mopping capabilities are quite good to match.\nShark PowerDetect Clean & Empty cordless vacuum for $400 (33 percent off): Shark's cordless vacuums are just as good as their robot vacuums, and you can usually find them on sale for less than other major brands. This one has great suction power and a relatively lightweight design, but the fact that it comes with a self-emptying base makes it an ultra-convenient choice.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/shark-robot-vacuums-are-up-to-half-off-in-these-prime-day-deals-170023907.html?src=rss",

    "full_text": "On July 15, the company will update its YouTube Partner Program (YPP) Monetization policies with more detailed guidelines around what type of content can earn creators money and what cannot. The exact policy language itself has not yet been released, but a page on YouTube’s Help documentation explains that creators have always been required to upload “original” and “authentic” content. The update says that the new language will help creators to better understand what “inauthentic” content looks like today. Some YouTube creators were concerned that the update would limit their ability to monetize certain types of videos, like reaction videos or those featuring clips, but a post from YouTube Head of Editorial & Creator Liaison Rene Ritchie says that’s not the case. In a video update published on Tuesday, Ritchie says that the change is just a “minor update” to YouTube’s longstanding YPP policies and is designed to better identify when content is mass-produced or repetitive. Some channels filled with AI music have millions of subscribers. In another example, a true crime murder series on YouTube that went viral was found to be entirely AI-generated, 404 Media reported earlier this year. Even YouTube CEO Neal Mohan’s likeness was used in an AI-generated phishing scam on the site, despite having tools in place that allow users to report deepfake videos. While YouTube may downplay the coming changes as a “minor” update or clarification, the reality is that allowing this type of content to grow and its creators to profit could ultimately damage YouTube’s reputation and value. It’s no surprise, then, that the company wants clear policies in place that allow it to enact mass bans of AI slop creators from YPP."

Once he solved it, he realized that ChatGPT had become one of his company’s greatest hype men — but it was also lying to people about what his app could do. Soundslice is an app for teaching music, used by students and teachers. “Our scanning system wasn’t intended to support this style of notation. Uploading those images wouldn’t translate the ASCII tab into audio notes. “The main cost was reputational: New Soundslice users were going in with a false expectation. He and his team discussed their options: Slap disclaimers all over the site about it — “No, we can’t turn a ChatGPT session into hearable music” — or build that feature into the scanner, even though he had never before considered supporting that offbeat musical notation system. Should we really be developing features in response to misinformation?” he wrote. The fellow programmers on Hacker News had an interesting take about it: Several of them said that it’s no different than an overeager human salesperson promising the world to prospects and then forcing developers to deliver new features. “I think that’s a very apt and amusing comparison!” Holovaty agreed."

    "summary": "Linda Yaccarino is stepping down as CEO of X, apparently effective immediately. She posted the news, naturally, on X, saying \"I’m immensely grateful to [Elon Musk] for entrusting me with the responsibility of protecting free speech, turning the company around, and transforming X into the Everything App.\" She went on to say that \"the historic business turn around we have accomplished together has been nothing short of remarkable.\" Reasonable minds can differ on if any of those things have happened.\nA few hours after Yaccarino's announcement, Musk offered a terse \"Thank you for your contributions\" in a post on X.\nAmong the many changes that have come to X since Yaccarino took over are decreased moderation, a greater reliance on \"community notes\" that aren't properly doing what they're intended to do and, most recently, an AI bot that spouts antisemitic hatespeech.\nAfter two incredible years, I’ve decided to step down as CEO of 𝕏. When @elonmusk and I first spoke of his vision for X, I knew it would be the opportunity of a lifetime to carry out the extraordinary mission of this company. I’m immensely grateful to him for entrusting me…— Linda Yaccarino (@lindayaX) July 9, 2025\n\nShe's also been really mad about a report from watchdog group Media Matters that caused a major advertiser pullback on X a few years ago. She claimed somehow that companies deciding not to run ads on a toxic platform amounted to a \"free speech\" issue. Later in the saga, X sued advertisers including Mars, Unilever and CVS Health for an \"illegal boycott,\" another example of her staunch commitment to free speech. \nMore recently, Media Matters sued the FTC, saying that the FTC was unfairly targeting it for its criticism of X; this comes after the FTC launched an investigation into Media Matters to determine if the group illegally colluded with advertisers. Naturally, this all happened while X owner Elon Musk was working closely with the federal government. The continual sniping and lawsuits to harm an organization for doing reporting she didn't like throws some cold water on her \"free speech\" claims.\nIf \"free speech\" equals \"hate speech,\" though, you could argue that Yaccarino met one of her stated goals. Numerous studies showed that hate speech has flourished on the platform over the last two years, including this recent study from Berkeley that found a \"persistent\" spike despite the company's claims that hate speech had declined over time. \nAI is a big part of X's quest to become whatever the hell an \"everything app\" is, but another big part of it is X Money, which is supposedly launching in partnership with Visa later this year. But Grok (and AI more broadly) is probably the biggest current initiative at the company, one that has been mired in controversy almost from the start. In addition to this week's antisemitic rants, Grok has also talked up a supposed \"white genocide\" in South Africa and also misled potential voters in the lead-up to the 2024 US presidential election. \nOther \"everything app\" features like video broadcasts and paid video content have been a bust, as well — perhaps no more significantly than a livestream with Musk and then-presidential candidate Donald Trump. The livestream infrastructure completely failed, with Musk claiming a \"massive DDOS\" was to blame. Meanwhile, broadcaster Don Lemon sued X after his interview show on the platform was immediately canceled, seemingly because Musk didn't like the questions Lemon asked him in an interview. \nAs for X's financial health and Yaccarino's claims of \"turning the company around,\"  it was impossible to miss reports that Musk's takeover cratered revenue and X's overall value. That said, some financial analysts believe that the company's advertising revenue will increase year-over-year for the first time since 2021 (an easier feat once you've spent a few years tanking it?). \nWhoever takes the position from Yaccarino clearly will have a tough act to follow, but there's no word on any potential successor yet.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/x-ceo-linda-yaccarino-is-stepping-down-after-two-years-145907096.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "The line between laptops built for gaming and those built for heavy-duty computing work has all but disappeared. These days, you don’t have to look too hard to find a not-so-flashy gaming notebook that could easily sit alongside MacBook Pros in a classroom. After all, a powerful CPU, video card and gobs of RAM will serve you well in both Clair Obscur and your video editing suite of choice.In our guide for the best gaming laptops, you can find my overall suggestions on what to look for when it comes to hardware. But the notebooks I chose for that guide weren’t selected for their ability to blend into quieter environments like libraries and lecture halls. So if you’re looking for something without annoyingly loud fans and distracting LED lighting, read on for our top picks for the best laptops for schoolwork and gaming.\nBest laptops for gaming and school in 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBest laptop for gaming and schoolwork FAQs\nAre gaming laptops good for school?\nAs we’ve mentioned, gaming laptops are especially helpful if you're doing any demanding work. Their big promise is powerful graphics performance, which isn't just limited to PC gaming. Video editing and 3D rendering programs can also tap into their GPUs to handle laborious tasks. While you can find decent GPUs on some productivity machines, like Dell's XPS 15, you can sometimes find better deals on gaming laptops. My general advice for any new workhorse: Pay attention to the specs; get at least 16GB of RAM and the largest solid state drive you can find (ideally 1TB or more). Those components are both typically hard to upgrade down the line, so it’s worth investing what you can up front to get the most out of your PC gaming experience long term. Also, don’t forget the basics like a webcam, which will likely be necessary for the schoolwork portion of your activities. \nThe one big downside to choosing a gaming notebook is portability. For the most part, we'd recommend 15-inch models to get the best balance of size and price. Those typically weigh in around 4.5 pounds, which is significantly more than a three-pound ultraportable. Today's gaming notebooks are still far lighter than older models, though, so at least you won't be lugging around a 10-pound brick. If you’re looking for something lighter, there are plenty of 14-inch options these days. And if you're not into LED lights and other gamer-centric bling, keep an eye out for more understated models that still feature essentials like a webcam (or make sure you know how to turn those lights off).\nDo gaming laptops last longer than standard laptops?\nNot necessarily — it really depends on how you define \"last longer.\" In terms of raw performance, gaming laptops tend to pack more powerful components than standard laptops, which means they can stay relevant for longer when it comes to handling demanding software or modern games. That makes them a solid choice if you need a system that won’t feel outdated in a couple of years, especially for students or creators who also game in their downtime.\nBut there’s a trade-off. All that power generates heat, and gaming laptops often run hotter and put more strain on internal components than typical ultraportables. If they’re not properly cooled or regularly maintained (think dust buildup and thermal paste), that wear and tear can shorten their lifespan. They’re also usually bulkier and have shorter battery life, which can impact long-term usability depending on your daily needs.\nGaming laptops can last longer performance-wise, but only if you take good care of them. If your needs are light — browsing, writing papers and streaming — a standard laptop may actually last longer simply because it’s under less stress day-to-day.\nWhat is the role of GPU in a computer for gaming and school?\nThe GPU plays a big role in how your laptop handles visuals — and it’s especially important if you’re using your computer for both gaming and school.\nFor gaming, the GPU is essential. It’s responsible for rendering graphics, textures, lighting and all the visual effects that make your favorite titles look smooth and realistic. A more powerful GPU means better frame rates, higher resolutions and the ability to play modern games without lag or stuttering.\nFor schoolwork, the GPU matters too — but its importance depends on what you're doing. If your school tasks mostly involve writing papers, browsing the web or using productivity tools like Google Docs or Microsoft Office, you don’t need a high-end GPU. But if you’re working with graphic design, video editing, 3D modeling or anything else that’s visually demanding, a good GPU can speed things up significantly and improve your workflow.\nGeorgie Peru contributed to this report.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/best-laptops-for-gaming-and-school-132207352.html?src=rss",

And on October 27, on the premier industry stage Going Public, David George of Andreessen Horowitz will take the mic for a fireside chat focused on one of the biggest questions facing founders today — how do you scale and succeed when the old rules no longer apply? What happens when your company stays private longer? Startups today can reach multibillion-dollar valuations, cash out early employees, and stay private far longer than their predecessors. Late-stage founders now face a new set of expectations around capital efficiency, liquidity, and growth strategy. This fireside chat with David George, general partner at Andreessen Horowitz, will unpack what it really takes to build enduring companies in today’s VC landscape. His insight into how capital is deployed — from early rounds to late-stage funding and secondary markets — offers founders a rare look behind the curtain at what growth investors are looking for now. With fewer IPOs, increased scrutiny on burn, and more capital staying private longer, today’s late-stage companies are navigating a totally different set of incentives. This session will explore how the IPO window is shifting, what role secondaries play in employee liquidity, and how startups can set themselves up to weather longer timelines while still moving toward big outcomes. Join 10,000 tech, startup, and VC leaders on October 27 at the Going Public Stage at TechCrunch Disrupt 2025."

After removing the instruction to “not shy away” from “politically incorrect” claims, the Grok account on X remains unresponsive to user queries, indicating that engineers may still be working on Grok’s programming. While it is not clear if the events are related, X CEO Linda Yaccarino stepped down from her role on Wednesday morning. Later on Wednesday night, Elon Musk is expected to debut the new Grok 4 model."

    "summary": "Amazon Prime Day is finally here, so now’s the time for members to stock up on discounted home essentials, clothing, shoes, and of course, tech while things are still on sale during day two. It’s safe to say that Amazon’s website will be overwhelming for the entirety of the event, so we wouldn’t blame you if you got distracted immediately upon opening it.\nIf you’ve got gadgets on your wishlist, Engadget has you covered. We’re surfacing the best Prime Day deals on gadgets and gear we can find for the whole of the shopping event. As in years past, Prime Day has brought solid discounts on some of our favorite tech including earbuds, tablets, robot vacuums and home devices. These are the best Prime Day deals for day two you can get right now. We’ll be updating this post regularly throughout the duration of Prime Day, so check back to see the latest discounts. \nPrime Day deals: Engadget's top picks\nApple AirPods Pro 2 for $149 (40 percent off): The AirPods Pro 2 remain Apple’s best set of wireless earbuds, as they offer the full set of Apple-focused features, strong ANC, onboard volume controls, a comfy in-ear design and a warm sound profile that most should find agreeable. They can even work as a hearing aid now.\nSamsung SmartTag 2 for $15.50 (48 percent off): Samsung users looking to keep track of their stuff need look no further than the SmartTag 2. One of our top picks for the best Bluetooth trackers, this accessory easily attaches to keys, bags and other items and uses Samsung's large finding network to show you their last known location.\nLeebein Electric Spin Scrubber for $38 (46 percent off): This was my favorite thing I bought last year because it makes the must-detested chore of cleaning my shower less of a pain. It's an electric spin scrubber that comes with multiple cleaning heads so you can use it on your countertops, sinks, tubs and showers and more. It also has an adjustable arm so you can reach tough spots in hard-to-reach places, and it convenient recharges via USB-C.\nDJI Neo drone for $159 (20 percent off): The DJI Neo may be an inexpensive, beginner-friendly drone, but has powerful features like subject tracking and quick shots. It can shoot video at up to 4K 30 fps and is quick and maneuverable, though it's also fairly loud. You can also grab one with three batteries and a charger for $229 (21 percent off).\niRobot Roomba Vacuum and Mop Combo for $140 (49 percent off): A version of one of our top favorite robot vacuums, this budget-friendly machine comes with a water reservoir that allows it to mop hard floors. It connects via Wi-Fi to the iRobot app as well, which lets you set cleaning schedules and further control the machine.\nDyson V15 Detect Plus for $570 ($180 off): You can't get much better than a Dyson if you're on the market for a cordless stick vacuum, and the V15 Detect delivers. It's our current top pick for the best cordless vacuum overall thanks to its excellent suction power, lightweight design, good battery life and the included Fluffy Optic cleaning head that uses a laser to show you where all the debris is while you're using it.\nSamsung 55-inch The Frame QLED 4K smart TV for $798 (47 percent off): This is the set that spurred all of the art TV copycats, and it's been a favorite of our staff for a long time. Samsung's set looks like a piece of art hanging on your wall when you're not watching TV, and you can cycle through thousands of images to show on the TV so you'll always have something new to display.\nNintendo Switch 2 + Mario Kart World bundle for $500: We'd be remiss if we didn't mention the fact that Amazon has the Nintendo Switch 2 available to order \"by invitation\" now. The Mario Kart World bundle is listed at the standard $500 price, so it's not a Prime Day deal per se, but considering Amazon was (supposedly) shut out of the initial Switch 2 order process earlier this year, it's notable to see the console listed on the site at all.\nPrime Day deals under $50\n\n\nAudible Premium Plus (three months) for $3 ($42 off): New subscribers can get three months of Audible for only $3, which represents a $42 discount. The Premium Plus tier gives you one book credit per month to use on any audiobook the service has, and you can stream any of the included titles for free on top of that. Audible also has members-only sales and discounts that you'll be able to take advantage of, too. The deal runs through July 31.\nJisulife Life7 handheld fan for $23 (21 percent off): Jisulife makes handheld fans we've recommended in past gift guides and this is one of its newer models. It can be held, folded so it sits flat on a table or worn around your neck for a cool breeze wherever you're going. It has an easy-to-read display in its center that will show you the fan speed level or current battery life, and its 5,000 mAh battery can last up to 19.5 hours on a single charge when you're running the fan on its lowest setting.\nAmazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max for $35 ($25 off): This stick handles Dolby Vision, Dolby Atmos, 4K video and HDR10+ and supports Wi-Fi 6E. It has the fastest processor of any Fire TV Stick and Engadget’s Jeff Dunn has gotten a lot of use from the stick as a retro gaming emulator. Of course, Amazon’s user interface is less elegant (and less democratic) than others. And it highly prioritizes Prime Video content.\nAmazon Echo Spot for $45 (44 percent off): Amazon revived the Spot smart alarm clock last year, which features a half-circle shaped display that shows the time, weather and other information like song titles when you're using the speaker to play music. It has a compact design that will make it easy to fit on a desk or a nightstand, and as with any Alexa smart speaker, you can use it to control IoT devices like smart lights, locks and more.\nPrime Day Apple deals\n\n\nApple iPad (A16) for $280 (20 percent off): The latest base model iPad comes with a faster A16 chip, 2GB more RAM and 128GB of storage as standard. It earned a score of 84 in our review — if you only need an iPad for roaming the internet, watching shows and doing some lighter productivity tasks, it's a good starter tablet.\nApple Watch Series 10 for $280 ($120 off): We consider Apple’s flagship wearable to be the best smartwatch you can buy, period. It's a mostly iterative update, with faster charging, a slightly slimmer design and a marginally larger display than the prior Series 9. That said, it's still a comprehensive fitness tracker, and no other smartwatch can integrate as neatly with iPhones and other Apple devices.\nAirPods Max (USB-C) for $399 (27 percent off): If you’re looking for over-ear headphones with all of the conveniences of in-ear AirPods, the AirPods Max are one of your only options (with the others being Beats devices). The latest models have the same design as the originals, but now charge up via USB-C instead of Lightning.\nPrime Day laptop deals\n\n\nMicrosoft Surface Laptop (13.8-inch, Snapdragon X Plus) for $880 (27 percent off): In addition to running on a Snapdragon X Plus processor, this 2024 Surface Laptop has 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD. It's a Copilot+ PC that also has a 13.8-inch touchscreen, and it should last up to 20 hours on a single charge.\nGoogle Pixelbook Go (13-inch, Intel Core M3) for $319 (51 percent off): The Pixelbook Go is a bit old at this point, but if you're a Chrome OS lover and want a Google-made laptop, this is a solid option. It includes an Intel Core M3 processor, 8GB of RAM, 64GB of storage and a 12-hour battery life.\nPrime Day tech deals\n\n\nHisense S7N CanvasTV (65-inch) for $898 (31 percent off): Hisense's spin on Samsung's Frame sets, the CanvasTV, comes in much cheaper and with a boatload of features. The S7N sports an anti-glare display and art mode, as you'd expect, but there's also 144Hz support for a bit of gaming. It also comes with a slim wall mount so you can hang it on your wall like a genuine work of art. (The 55-inch model is also a great deal at $689, and the 77-inch is down to $1,399.)\nBose QuietComfort headphones for $199 (42 percent off):design is slightly dated, the Bose QuietComfort headphones provide stellar noise cancellation and will sit comfortably on your head for hours on end. These cans have up to 24 hours of battery life and support for multi-device connectivity as well.\nSony WH-1000XM5 headphones for $298 (25 percent off): While the XM6 headphones are the latest and greatest, they only make small changes to the already stellar XM5. These were our top pick for the best wireless headphones for a long time before the XM6 launched earlier this year, and we still like them for their excellent sound quality, strong ANC, multi-device connectivity and good battery life.\nSonos Beam Gen 2 for $369 (26 percent off): The second-gen Beam soundbar has support for Dolby Atmos and it has a relatively streamlined design that should be easy to fit into most home entertainment setups.\nKindle for $85 ($25 off): Our favorite budget option in our guide to the best ereaders, the latest base Kindle has 16GB of storage — more than enough to hold hundreds of books at a time. It has a compact and durable design that’s easy to take anywhere, and the latest model is faster than before with speedy page turns and a more seamless navigation between books, your library and other parts of the UI.\nKindle Scribe for $260 ($140 off): The Scribe is one of the best E-Ink tablets you can buy at the moment, and certainly the top pick if you want a writable table that also excels as an ereader. It provides a great reading and writing experience, thanks in part to its ability to access the entire Kindle ebook library, and it has handy Google Drive, Microsoft OneDrive and Dropbox integration.\nInstant Pot Duo Plus 9-in-1 multicooker for $70 (50 percent off): This six-quart pressure cooker and multicooker is a versatile kitchen tool for anyone who (somehow) didn't buy into the Instant Pot craze a few years back. It can do a lot with its nine cooking modes, including pressure cook, slow cook, steam, rice cook, saute and more, and the six-quart size is great for families and meal-preppers.\nNinja Dual-Zone air fryer (10 quart) for $180 ($50 off): This model is one of our favorite air fryers thanks to its dual-zone cooking system, which allows you to prepare two separate foods at different temperatures and settings. There's even a Match Cook feature that ensures both foods will be done at the same time, regardless of their cooking settings.\nLevoit Core 400S air purifier for $183 ($37 off): Our top pick for the best air purifier, Levoit's Core 400S reliably improved air quality in our testing, plus it has easy to use onboard controls and replaceable filters that are not too expensive. We also found it to not be offensively loud, even on its highest setting.\nTP-Link Deco XE75 Wi-Fi 6E mesh system for $200 (20 percent off): Our top pick for the best mesh Wi-Fi system, this Deco XE75 three-pack is easy to set up and provides excellent performance with no-frills. The Deco mobile app lets you check speeds for each node, and you can see all of the devices on your network at any time.\nRing Doorbell Battery + Indoor Cam 2 for $70 (50 percent off): If you're looking to build out a security system in your home, this bundle is a good place to start, giving you a video doorbell and an indoor security camera. You'll be able to see both live feeds in the Ring app, and they can send you motion alerts and let you speak to people on the other end of the camera when you're not at home.\nAmazon Fire TV Cube for $90 ($50 off): Amazon's most powerful streaming device, the Fire TV Cube can play 4K video with Dolby Vision and HDR10+, plus it supports Wi-Fi 6E and has a built-in Ethernet port for those who want a hardwired connection.\nAmazon 55-inch Omni mini-LED Fire smart TV for $700 ($120 off): A top-of-the-line model in the Fire TV family, this set has a 4K QLED mini-LED display with 1,400 nits of peak brightness and \"intelligence picture\" technology that adapts the screen to your room's lighting conditions. It also has a 144Hz refresh rate and support for AMD FreeSync.\nWhat is Prime Day?\nPrime Day is Amazon's members-only shopping event, which means you’ll have to be a Prime subscriber on Prime Day to take advantage of most of the savings. Amazon still offers a 30-day free trial to new Prime subscribers, so you can start your free trial closer to July and participate in the event.\nWhen is Prime Day 2025?\nAmazon Prime Day 2025 will be back this year on July 8 through July 11.\nHow often is Prime Day?\nAmazon Prime Day typically comes around annually in July. In the last few years, Amazon has also had its \"Big Deal Days\" in October, which is effectively a second Prime Day and the unofficial kickoff to the holiday shopping season.\nHow does Prime Day work?\nPrime subscribers can go to Amazon's site on Prime Day to see all of the exclusive deals they have access to. Prime subscribers do not have to do anything additional to get Prime Day sales: the discounts you see on product pages will show up in your cart automatically. If you're not a Prime subscriber and you go to Amazon to shop on Prime Day, you'll likely see tons of items on sale but only \"with Prime;\" those discounts will not be available to those who are not active Prime subscribers.\nIs Prime Day only for Prime members?\nTechnically yes, but even if you do not pay for a Prime membership, you should still check out Amazon on Prime Day. While most Prime Day deals will be exclusively available to subscribers, there are always a handful of sales available to all shoppers. Amazon distinguishes between them very clearly: you'll see \"Prime exclusive\" on product pages near the deal pricing on the discounts that are only available to paying members.\nSeparately, it’s very likely that other retailers like Walmart, Target and Best Buy will have their own competing Prime Day sales during that time frame, too. So if you're not keen on shopping at Amazon at all, it's worth checking out other retailers during the week of Prime Day to see if they are matching Prime Day deal prices.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-amazon-prime-day-deals-for-day-two-are-live-get-up-to-50-percent-off-our-top-picks-on-headphones-tvs-robot-vacuums-and-more-134756617.html?src=rss",

I’m immensely grateful to him for entrusting me… — Linda Yaccarino (@lindayaX) July 9, 2025 X owner Elon Musk replied, “Thank you for your contributions,” and has not made any other comment about the future of the CEO role at X. Her departure also comes on the same day that Musk is supposed to reveal Grok 4. Yaccarino joined the company just months into Musk’s ownership, leaving her longtime role as chairwoman of global advertising and partnerships at NBCUniversal. Given her stature as an advertising executive, Yaccarino was brought in as X CEO to maintain relationships with advertisers amid a massive shift in platform leadership when Musk bought Twitter. Within the first six months of her tenure, Musk used his personal X account to endorse the antisemitic “great replacement” conspiracy, as well as other debunked conspiracy theories like Pizzagate. He went on to sue nonprofit research groups like Center for Countering Digital Hate and Media Matters, which published a report that highlighted X’s display of extremist content beside advertisements for companies like IBM and Apple, leading them and other major advertisers to depart the platform. “X is enabling an information independence that’s uncomfortable for some people,” she said at the time. “We’re a platform that allows people to make their own decisions."

    "full_text": "Perplexity on Wednesday launched its first AI-powered web browser, called Comet, marking the startup’s latest effort to challenge Google Search as the primary avenue people use to find information online. At launch, Comet will be available first to subscribers of Perplexity’s $200-per-month Max plan, as well as a small group of invitees that signed up to a waitlist. Here’s what a New tab looks like for me on Comet Image Credits:Screengrab/Maxwell Zeff / Perplexity Users can also access Comet Assistant, a new AI agent from Perplexity that lives in the web browser and aims to automate routine tasks. Srinivas said in March that his goal with Comet was to “develop an operating system with which you can do almost everything,” enabling Perplexity’s AI to help users across apps and websites. Taking on Google Search is no small task, but Perplexity seems to have the right idea by launching a browser of its own. Perplexity’s on-browser AI agent can automatically see what I’m looking at, so I can simply ask it questions without needing to open a new window or copy and paste text or links. But it seems AI agents need this kind of access to be useful. The assistant was also able to summarize emails I received that morning from noteworthy senders — in my case, important startups and tech companies with upcoming news. For example, I tried asking it to help me find a long-term parking spot at San Francisco’s airport for an upcoming trip, specifically places with good reviews that cost less than $15 a day."

    "summary": "The latest Amazon Kindle Scribe ereader is on sale for just $260 as part of the Prime Day festivities. This is a record-low price and a discount of $140. The sale applies to the 16GB model, which is enough storage for thousands of books and notes.\nThe Kindle Scribe is Amazon's answer to devices like the reMarkable E ink tablet. It's both a standard ereader and a tablet for taking notes, as it ships with a pen for scribbling. This makes it handy for writing down thoughts or for mindlessly drawing pizza slices. Users can jot notes over books, but not every title supports this feature. \n\n\nThe Scribe made our list of the best E Ink tablets for a number of reasons. We appreciated the low latency when writing. In most cases, users won't notice any latency at all. The latest software update also brings in new brush types, which now include a fountain pen, a marker and a pencil. This device makes it easy to create multiple notebooks for different purposes. There are even some AI tools for summarization and the like.\nOf course, it's also a standard ereader. I have a Scribe and, to be honest, I use it primarily for reading. The giant 10.2-inch screen is just so luxe and offers a superior reading experience to standard-sized Kindles. It's a bit heavier and cumbersome to hold for long periods, but that tradeoff is worth it to me.\nThe only major downside here is the price. It's tough to recommend a $400 ereader, even with all of the handwriting bells and whistles. However, this sale certainly takes the edge off a bit.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-latest-kindle-scribe-is-on-sale-for-a-record-low-price-thanks-to-prime-day-131544927.html?src=rss",
