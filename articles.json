    "summary": "If you’ve been holding out on a new set of earbuds or headphones during Prime Day, now’s a great time to take a look at the deals. While Sony and Bose are typically among our favorites each year, there are a number of options available at discounted prices right now. Whether you prefer over-ear headphones or true wireless earbuds, the list of deals accounts for both styles and includes a range of prices. Plus, we’ll guide you through the fray with the best features of each model so you’re not left sorting out the spec sheet by yourself. All of the deals below are still available on day 3 of the four-day sale. \n\nPrime Day Sony deals\n\n\nSony WH-1000XM6 headphones for $428 ($22 off): Sony's latest flagship headphones have only been out a few months and we're already seeing a small discount on them. These are my top pick in our headphones guide for the combination of advanced features, comfy fit, great sound and improved active noise cancellation (ANC).  \nSony ULT Wear headphones for $128 ($72 off): If you're after a solid set of Sony cans but don't want to splurge for the 1000X line, the ULT Wear is a good option. There are a bunch of handy features and robust sound with ULT bass boost.\nSony WH-CH720N headphones for $78 ($72 off): The cheapest Sony headphones we'd recommend for Prime Day are no slouch. They're lightweight and comfy with respectable sound for the price. You also get Adaptive Sound Control, 360 Reality Audio and multipoint Bluetooth on this budget model. \nSony WF-1000XM5 earbuds for $198 ($102 off): My top pick for best earbuds is also on sale for Prime Day. No other company comes close to the list of features Sony offers here, and that's on top of excellent sound, improved fit and effective ANC. \nSony LinkBud Fit earbuds for $128 ($72 off): Sony's much smaller earbuds offer big sound and a lot of features for less than the 1000X model. These are a big improvement over the company's LinkBuds S, which were already a low-key hit for affordable earbuds.\nSony WF-CH710N earbuds for $78 ($42 off): The CH710N is still quite new, but the earbuds are a steal at $80 for Prime Day. The compact, comfy design is a highlight, as are all the features Sony managed to pack in. Plus, they're available in a lovely transparent blue that allows you to see all of the internal components. \nSonos Prime Day deals\n\n\nPrime Day Bose deals (also available at Bose.com)\n\n\nBose QuietComfort Earbuds for $129 (28 percent off): The best Bose earbuds for most people are getting a decent discount this week. This model gives you the company's powerful ANC and great sound for less than flagship prices. You also get spatial audio and dependable battery life in this affordable option.\nBose Ultra Open Earbuds for $199 (33 percent off): If you thought Bose's clip-on open earbuds were a bit too pricey to splurge on, now's your chance to get them for less. And two colors are available at an even bigger discount than the rest, putting this set just under $200. Plus, this model works with the company's soundbars for an enhanced living room listening experience. \nBeats Prime Day deals\n\n\nBeats Solo 4 headphones for $98 (50 percent off): Beats' popular on-ear headphones are half off for Prime Day, which makes them a great deal for fans of that wear style. While they may look similar to their predecessor, the Solo 4 have improved sound and longer battery life compared to that older model.\nBeats Powerbeats Pro 2 earbuds for $180 (28 percent off): Apple's first earbuds with heart rate tracking are slightly discounted for Prime Day. This your chance to try the tech without paying full price. What's more, the Powerbeats Pro 2 have an improved design, the smarts of Apple's H2 chip and powerful bass. \nPrime Day Samsung deals\n\n\nSamsung Galaxy Buds FE for $52 (48 percent off): Samsung's budget earbuds are solid option if you're looking to spend less than $60. Like the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro, these are best-suited for Samsung devices where you'll find features like live translation and automatic switching.\nApple and Google Prime Day deals\n\n\nApple AirPods 4 for $89 (31 percent off): The redesigned \"regular\" AirPods that debuted last year are currently available well below their normal $129 price tag. Here, you'll get the new, more comfortable shape as well as updated features. \nApple AirPods 4 with ANC for $119 (34 percent off): And if you need some ANC to go with your AirPods, but don't want to go for the Pro 2, here's your best bet. These retain the open-style fit of regular AirPods but add surprisingly effective ANC to the mix. \nApple AirPods Max (USB-C) for $430 (22 percent off): Apple's over-ear headphones are $119 off during Prime Day, which softens the blow to your wallet for this pricey set. They're comfy and offer a lot of handy features for Apple devices. Plus, you can unlock lossless listening with a wired connection. \nGoogle Pixel Buds Pro 2 for $160 (30 percent off): The best earbuds for Pixel phone users are down to $160, which makes them a great purchase right now. Live translate and hands-free access to Gemini might be the highlight, but these earbuds have great sound and capable ANC too. \nPrime Day deals on Dyson\nDyson OnTrac headphones for $300 (40 percent off): This set isn't without its flaws, but I can understand why you'd be drawn to the almost infinitely customizable design and long battery life. There's also real-time hearing health features and the sound is crisp and clear even though it lacks depth and immersion. \nJBL Prime Day deals\nJBL Tour One M2 headphones for $150 (50 percent off): The biggest discount on JBL headphones or earbuds comes on the flagship over-hear Tour One M2. These ANC headphones have Smart Ambient sound, Smart Talk automatic pausing and other advanced features. \nJBL Live Beam 3 for $150 (25 percent off): If you're looking for a discounted way to get your hands on JBL's touchscreen earbud case, the Live Beam 3 is your chance. In addition to the fancy case, you'll get up to 12 hours of use on a charge, adaptive ANC and high-res audio compatibility. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/prime-day-2025-the-best-headphone-and-earbud-deals-from-sony-beats-bose-and-more-still-available-today-082347543.html?src=rss",

James Carter Cathcart, who was best known for his voice acting work in animation and video games, died of throat cancer at 71, Variety reports.\nThe actor, who was frequently credited as \"Jimmy Zoppi\" and \"Carter Cathcart\" throughout his career, played a variety of Pokémon's most memorable supporting characters. Alongside Professor Oak, Cathcart voiced his grandson Gary Oak and Team Rocket's Meowth and James across over 700 episodes of the animated series and 15 movies. That includes Pokémon: The First Movie, Cathcart's first feature film credit. His work wasn't exclusive to animation, either. Cathcart also voiced Vector the Crocodile in the game Shadow the Hedgehog, and provided voices for multiple Pokémon that appeared in Super Smash Bros. Brawl.\nBeyond voice acting, Cathcart was a talented musician and writer. He's credited with writing and adapting multiple English-language versions of Pokémon TV movies.  After 25 years in the entertainment industry, Cathcart decided to retire from voice acting in 2023 due to his cancer diagnosis, Kotaku writes.

    "summary": "Amazon's pages are stuffed with Prime Day discounts right now. But how do you know which are complete garbage and which are worth your time? That's what many of us at Engadget have been working on lately — finding Prime Day deals on the gadgets we actually recommend. This guide rounds up the kitchen gear we’ve tested in our own apartments and houses. So read our reviews (linked below) to make sure a device is what you want before you buy. Some of our recommended Air fryers, sous vide machines, rice cookers and more are seeing some of the best Prime Day kitchen deals around.\nEditor's note: We've been waiting to see if Ninja's Creami ice cream maker would see a good discount. Right now, a bundle with extra containers is selling for $200, but that's still well above the low of $160 we saw as recently as January. We'll continue to monitor the sale and will update this guide if the price goes lower.  \nPrime Day air fryer deals\n\n\nNinja Foodie Dual Zone Air Fryer (10 QT) for $180 ($70 off): This is the air fryer to pick if you’ve ever wished you could air fry two different things at the same time. We named it the best dual-zone air fryer you can get — it even has a feature that makes sure the two different foods are ready at the same time.\nInstant Vortex Plus Air Fryer (6 QT) for $100 ($70 off): After studious testing (and dutiful eating) our reviewers named this one the best air fryer you can buy. And, after reading that assessment, I bought one myself so I can verify this is one great machine. The Odor Ease tech really does keep the cooking smells at bay and the window lets me keep an eye on all the crisping that’s going on in there.\nInstant Pot Vortex Plus Air Fryer (4QT) for $65 (50 percent off with Prime): Here’s a smaller version of the Instant air fryer we named best overall. It has a four-quart capacity, which is perfect for one person and small kitchens. And, like its larger sibling, pre-heats quickly.\nCosori Air Fryer 9-in-1 for $90 ($30 off): The runner up pick in our air fryer guide has a spacious cooking capacity yet takes up surprisingly little counter space. Little features like an intuitive touchscreen, a safety release button on the basket and an auto-pause feature set this cooker apart.\nBreville Smart Oven Air Fryer Pro for $320 ($80 off): This is the premium pick in our air fryer guide — but really, it does far more than just air fry. As our reviewer noted, its massive cubic-foot-capacity and numerous cook modes make this more like an auxiliary oven. (It can even cook an entire 14-pound turkey.) It went on sale for $300 during last year's Black Friday sales. \nInstant Vortex Plus Air Fryer (6 QT) for $100 ($70 off): After studious testing (and dutiful eating) our reviewers named this one the best air fryer you can buy. And, after reading that assessment, I bought one myself so I can verify this is one great machine. The Odor Ease tech really does keep the cooking smells at bay and the window lets me keep an eye on all the crisping that’s going on in there.\nNinja Air Fryer (4 QT) for $80 ($50 off): The budget pick from our air fryer guide isn’t currently on sale, but this four-quart Ninja fryer has twice the capacity and is nearly the same price. It can also roast and dehydrate in addition to air frying and reheating.\nCheck out our guide to air fryers to read our testing results.\nPrime Day Instant Pot and rice cooker deals\n\n\nCuckoo Twin Pressure Rice Cooker for $190 ($70 off with Prime): This is the best premium rice cooker in our guide to those machines. We like how quickly it cooks all types of rice to perfection (we tested it with long-grain white basmati, brown and sushi-grade white rice). Just keep in mind that it can be a little difficult to clean and the manual isn’t the most user-friendly.\nHamilton Beach Digital Programmable Rice Cooker for $40 ($10 off with Prime): Our top pick for a budget rice cooker is on sale for Prime members. The brown rice came out particularly good in our tests and the cooker is easy to clean with a dishwasher-safe cooker pot and steamer basket. Just note that it’s pretty small and doesn’t have the granular controls of pricer models.\nPrime Day kitchen tech deals\n\n\nOoni Volt 12 Electric Indoor Pizza Oven for $630 ($270 off) from Ooni: Note: This deal has expired at Amazon, but is still available directly from Ooni. The Volt 12 is our pick for the best indoor pizza oven — but it can be used outdoors as well thanks to its weather-resistant design. It has front-mounted controls that let you individually control the upper and lower heating elements and it can get up to 850 degrees Fahrenheit in as little as 20 minutes.  \nFellow Stagg EKG Pro electric kettle for $160 ($35 off with Prime): This exquisitely designed kettle has an LCD panel built into the base so you can choose a specific temperature down to the degree. And the hold feature keeps water hot for up to an hour. I bought this after reading our tea guide and have appreciated the steady pour. You’ll likely only see the sale price if you’re a Prime member.\nNinja CREAMi Ice Cream Maker (bundle) for $200 ($30 off): We said this machine “makes your frozen dreams come true.” It’s easy to use and makes thick, dense ice cream with flavors that are more intense and textures that are smoother than rival ice cream makers. Plus most of the parts are machine washable or easily rinsed. This bundle comes with extra containers and is the lowest price we’ve seen in a few months, but note that the Creami sold for $160 as recently as January.\nBreville Joule Turbo Sous Vide Machine for $200 ($50 off): The premium pick in our guide to sous vice machines has a powerful 1,100-watt heater that cuts down on cooking times. It also uses your phone as the controller (just don’t get it if you’re hoping for on-device buttons).\nAnova Sous Vide Cooker 3.0 for $138 (40 percent off): Our top pick for a sous vide machine delivers 1,100 watts of power and a flow rate of eight liters per minute which will get your water up to the right temperature faster. It also has intuitive digital touch controls and Wi-Fi connectivity.\nBreville Juice Fountain Plus for $120 ($60 off with Prime): The extraction abilities on this machine are impressive. Plus we found it relatively easy to clean (as long as you do it right after you juice). It takes up a good amount of space, but can extract an impressive amount of juice from even the driest-seeming carrot. This is the lowest price in a while, but it went down to $110 in January.\nPrime Day KitchenAid and blender deals\n\n\nKitchenAid Classic Series (4.5 QT) for $300 ($50 off): Prime Day and Black Friday sales are usually the best times to snag Kitchen Aid’s iconic mixers — unfortunately, this discount isn’t even as good as the $250 it sold for in May. Still you can save $50 on a classic appliance that we recommend in our guide to essential kitchen gadgets. These mixers are durable, reliable and, with the wide range of attachments, can truly expand your cooking arsenal.\nVitamix 5200 Blender Professional-Grade for $350 ($150 off with Prime): I can personally attest to the nearly magical abilities of Vitamix blenders. It can make chunky salsas, smooth-as-silk soups and smoothies in which the chia and hemp seeds seem to disappear into the fruit. This pro-grade model is down to the lowest price we’ve tracked this year.\nKitchenAid Variable Speed Corded Hand Blender for $55 ($15 off): We recommend the cordless version of this immersion blender in our guide to those appliances. This corded version has the same variable speed trigger which makes it easy to control your recipes. Note that this sold for $5 less as recently as May.\nVitamix E310 Explorian Blender for $330 ($50 off): Note that we've seen this go for as little as $255 in past sales, and it dropped to $300 as recently as May. But this is still a decent $50 discount on a blender that will make any food you put in it smooth. We recommend it in our guide to the best kitchen tech.\nExpired deals\nMannkitchen Pepper Cannon for $160 ($40 off): Not everyone needs a super expensive pepper mill. But it nonetheless became one of our reviewer’s favorite pieces of kitchen gear. A side-by-side comparison showed us just how much more pepper came out of the cannon compared to a standard store-bought mill.\nInstant Pot Duo Plus 9-in-1 (6 QT) for $70 ($70 off): Perhaps you know someone who has somehow gotten this far in life without owning an Instant Pot — perhaps that someone is you. Amazon’s Prime Day is a golden opportunity to remedy that. We named it the best multi-cooker you can buy in our guide to kitchen tech.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/amazon-prime-day-kitchen-deals-include-up-to-50-percent-off-on-air-fryers-instant-pots-blenders-and-more-180019208.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Subnautica 2 is one of the most highly anticipated games around. It's the second-most wishlisted game on Steam behind (you guessed it) Hollow Knight: Silksong. However, you'll need to wait longer than anticipated to try Subnautica 2 in four-player co-op, as the survival game's early access release has been delayed until early 2026.\nDeveloper Unknown Worlds said that community members who took part in playtests provided positive feedback about the story, creatures, environment and general direction of the game. However, the studio said, they \"also provided some insight that there are a few areas where we needed to improve before launching the first version of Subnautica 2 to the world. Our community is at the heart of how we develop, so we want to give ourselves a little extra time to respond to more of that feedback before releasing the game into early access. With that in mind, we’ve made the decision to delay Subnautica 2’s early access release to 2026.\"\n\nThe delay will afford Unknown Worlds a chance to add more biomes, tools, vehicle upgrades and creatures while expanding the story, the studio said. Players can expect more details in the coming months.\nBut news of the delay comes amid behind-the-scenes drama at Unknown Worlds. Bloomberg reports that the studio had been in line for a $250 million bonus (which the leadership group planned to share with employees) from Krafton if it hit revenue goals by the end of this year. The delay reportedly means Unknown Worlds is very unlikely to hit those targets. As such, Bloomberg's sources suggest that means the team of around 100 people may not be eligible for the payout.\nLast week, Krafton — which bought Unknown Worlds in 2021 — turfed out the studio's leadership team of CEO Ted Gill and co-founders Charlie Cleveland and Max McGuire. The publisher brought in Steve Papoutsis, a former executive at The Callisto Protocol developer Striking Distance, as the new CEO of Unknown Worlds.\n\"There is nothing more important than the gamer experience. Given the anticipation around Subnautica 2, we owe our players nothing less than the best possible game, as soon as possible,\" Krafton CEO CH Kim said in a statement, \"We are thrilled Steve is joining us in our shared commitment at Krafton and Unknown Worlds to deliver Subnautica 2 as a more complete and satisfying entry in the series — one that truly lives up to player expectations.\"\nPer Bloomberg, Papoutsis told employees this week that Krafton didn't believe Subnautica 2 was ready for an early access release and claimed he didn't know the specifics of the contract regarding the quarter-billion-dollar bonus. \"It’s never been told to me that we’re making this change specifically to impact any earnout or anything like that,\" he reportedly told staff.\nAccording to Cleveland, however, Subnautica 2 is actually \"ready for early access release.\" The studio's co-founder wrote in a lengthy X post on July 5 that \"while we thought this was going to be our decision to make, at least for now, that decision is in Krafton’s hands.\"\nA Krafton spokesperson told Eurogamer that the decision to delay Subnautica 2 was \"based solely on our commitment to quality and to delivering the best possible experience for players\" and it was not \"influenced by any contractual or financial considerations.\" They added that \"the decision had already been under discussion prior to recent leadership changes at the studio.\"\nUpdate, July 10, 3:15PM ET: In a statement shared with Engadget, Krafton provided additional context around the terms of the $250 million bonus payment and reiterated its commitment to Unknown Worlds going forward. The studio said the current version of Subnautica 2 falls short of expectations, and laid the blame at Cleveland and McGuire's feet.\n\"The former leadership abandoned the responsibilities entrusted to them,\" the statement said. \"Subnautica 2 was originally planned for an Early Access launch in early 2024, but the timeline has since been significantly delayed. Krafton made multiple requests to Charlie and Max to resume their roles as Game Director and Technical Director, respectively, but both declined to do so. In particular, following the failure of Moonbreaker, Krafton asked Charlie to devote himself to the development of Subnautica 2. However, instead of participating in the game development, he chose to focus on a personal film project. Krafton believes that the absence of core leadership has resulted in repeated confusion in direction and significant delays in the overall project schedule.\"\nKrafton's full statement reads as follows:\nTo Our 12 Million Fellow Subnauts,—  Inevitable Leadership Change Driven by Project Abandonment–Despite Holding 90% of Earnout for ThemselvesFirst and foremost, we sincerely thank you for your continued support, passion, and unwavering dedication to Subnautica. We wish to provide clarity on the recent leadership changes at Unknown Worlds, a creative studio under KRAFTON.Background of Leadership Change\nKRAFTON deeply values Subnautica’s unique creativity and immersive world-building. To provide fans with even better gaming experiences, we acquired Unknown Worlds, fully committed to supporting Subnautica’s future success. We collaborated closely with the studio’s leadership, who were central to the creation of the original Subnautica, to foster the optimal environment for a successful Subnautica 2.Specifically, in addition to the initial $500 million purchase price, we allocated approximately 90% of the up to $250 million earn-out compensation to the three former executives, with the expectation that they would demonstrate leadership and active involvement in the development of Subnautica 2.However, regrettably, the former leadership abandoned the responsibilities entrusted to them. Subnautica 2 was originally planned for an Early Access launch in early 2024, but the timeline has since been significantly delayed. KRAFTON made multiple requests to Charlie and Max to resume their roles as Game Director and Technical Director, respectively, but both declined to do so. In particular, following the failure of Moonbreaker, KRAFTON asked Charlie to devote himself to the development of Subnautica 2. However, instead of participating in the game development, he chose to focus on a personal film project.KRAFTON believes that the absence of core leadership has resulted in repeated confusion in direction and significant delays in the overall project schedule.The current Early Access version also falls short in terms of content volume.We are deeply disappointed by the former leadership’s conduct, and above all, we feel a profound sense of betrayal by their failure to honor the trust placed in them by our fans.KRAFTON’s Full Support for the Dedicated Development Team\nTo uphold our commitment to provide you with the best possible gaming experience, we made the difficult yet necessary decision to change the executive leadership. Subnautica 2 has been and continues to be actively developed by a dedicated core team who share genuine passion, accountability, and commitment to the game. We deeply respect their expertise and creativity and will continue to provide full and unwavering support, enabling them to focus solely on delivering the exceptional game you deserve.KRAFTON’s Commitment to its Promises in Rewarding Employees\nAdditionally, KRAFTON has committed to fair and equitable compensation for all remaining Unknown Worlds employees who have continuously and tirelessly contributed to Subnautica 2’s development. We believe that the dedication and effort of this team are at the very heart of Subnautica’s ongoing evolution, and we reaffirm our commitment to provide the rewards they were promised.Fans will always remain at the center of every decision we make at KRAFTON. Moving forward, we promise transparent communication and continued efforts to sustainably develop and expand the beloved Subnautica universe.Honoring your trust and expectations is a core tenet at KRAFTON. We are committed to repaying your patience with an even more refined and exceptional gaming experience.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/subnautica-2s-early-access-release-delayed-to-2026-amid-developer-drama-123042406.html?src=rss",
    "full_text": "Subnautica 2 is one of the most highly anticipated games around. However, you'll need to wait longer than anticipated to try Subnautica 2 in four-player co-op, as the survival game's early access release has been delayed until early 2026. Developer Unknown Worlds said that community members who took part in playtests provided positive feedback about the story, creatures, environment and general direction of the game. But news of the delay comes amid behind-the-scenes drama at Unknown Worlds. The delay reportedly means Unknown Worlds is very unlikely to hit those targets. Last week, Krafton — which bought Unknown Worlds in 2021 — turfed out the studio's leadership team of CEO Ted Gill and co-founders Charlie Cleveland and Max McGuire. Given the anticipation around Subnautica 2, we owe our players nothing less than the best possible game, as soon as possible,\" Krafton CEO CH Kim said in a statement, \"We are thrilled Steve is joining us in our shared commitment at Krafton and Unknown Worlds to deliver Subnautica 2 as a more complete and satisfying entry in the series — one that truly lives up to player expectations.\" \"It’s never been told to me that we’re making this change specifically to impact any earnout or anything like that,\" he reportedly told staff. The studio's co-founder wrote in a lengthy X post on July 5 that \"while we thought this was going to be our decision to make, at least for now, that decision is in Krafton’s hands.\" A Krafton spokesperson told Eurogamer that the decision to delay Subnautica 2 was \"based solely on our commitment to quality and to delivering the best possible experience for players\" and it was not \"influenced by any contractual or financial considerations.\""

    "full_text": "It may not surprise anyone who is tech-aware that publications such as The Verge track the affiliate links that are clicked by their readers — in fact, every article that links to a vendor has this statement on top: “If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission.” It’s nice to know that I’m not the only one who needs a portable charger that is truly portable — in other words, you can pop it into your bag or pocket and not feel as if you’ve just added several pounds to your load. I’ve had mine for several months now, and have found it a great addition to my day-to-day carry-alongs. These have noise cancellation, along with even better sound quality and onboard volume controls. What with the EPA suspending employees and rolling back rules protecting drinking water, it’s probably a good idea to make sure the water you drink is properly filtered, even if you’re not camping or traveling. The LifeStraw is a handy way to keep your water (even from natural freshwater sources) safe to drink; you can either use it at home or take it with you while traveling. This rechargeable screwdriver has been a Verge favorite for several years — I’m not sure how many of us have one, but it’s several — and our readers seem to like it as well. And back to Apple: the 11-inch M3 iPad Air (128GB Wi-Fi) is not only at an all-time low price of $538.99 ($139 off) for Prime Day, but includes two years of AppleCare factored into the price (it’s $479 without this perk). According to reviewer David Pierce, the main difference between this and its predecessor is that it runs on an M3 chip. As someone who has lived with two cats, I know how much fur animals can generate — to the point that you really do need something for that quick couch cleanup before your guests arrive."

    "summary": "If you don't feel like dropping major dollars on Prime Day, there are plenty of gadgets and accessories Engadget recommends that you can get for less than $50. Of course, some of the deals require you to be a Prime member to access them but a few deals are for non-members too (we noted which require Prime below). Right now, you can snag the new Echo Spot smart speaker, a slew of Anker charging gear, a Soundcore portable speaker, TP-Link smart plugs, microSD cards, USB-C cables and a whole lot more for less than $50 a pop. Here are the best Prime Day tech deals under $50.\nEngadget's top picks\nSamsung Galaxy SmartTag2 Bluetooth tracker for $16 ($14 off): If you have a Samsung phone, the company’s own Bluetooth tracker may make the most sense for you. We say as much in our guide to these finding fobs. The design is attractive and the finding network admirable, drawing on the signals of nearby Galaxy devices to pinpoint your lost keys. \nAmazon Echo Spot for $45 ($35 off with Prime): The Spot speaker was resurrected last year with a slightly different design than it first had. Now the display is a half-circle on the round face of the clock and it can show you the weather, time and song title. The speaker itself brings you all Alexa can do, like setting timers, adding stuff to your grocery lists and answering questions about the weather.\nAnker Nano USB-C charger block for $12 ($8 off): Remember when tiny bricks like this all maxed out at a dinky five-watts? This tiny but mighty cube is the best cheap fast charger in our guide to fast chargers and it outputs a generous 30 watts, plus the prongs fold down to make it even more teensy.\nBlink Mini 2 security camera (two-pack) for $35 ($35 off with Prime): Our pick for the best budget security camera is now even more budget friendly. We appreciated this diminutive camera’s ease of setup and excellent integration with Alexa devices, like Echo speakers and displays. It requires a subscription for person detection and cloud storage, and the image quality wasn’t the best of the bunch. If you just need one camera, you can pick one up for $20.\nThe best Prime Day tech deals under $25\n\n\nAmazon Smart Plug for $13 ($12 off with Prime): This plug and an Alexa Echo device makes a perfect smart home starter kit (and a number of Echos are on sale for Prime Day, too). Snap this into your outlet and Alexa should automatically detect it (if not, a few taps in the Alexa app should get things connected). Then you can use it to control any lamp, fan or other simple device you plug into it — just by asking the assistant.\nAnker Right-Angle USB-C braided charging cable (two-pack) for $10 ($6 off with Prime): This is the cable I used to turn an old iPad into a digital picture frame. The right-angle looks much neater than a straight cable, plus this one can shuttle up to 240 watts of power during charging.\nAnker iPhone Nano Power Bank with Built-in USB-C Connector for $20 ($10 off with Prime): One of these little guys could represent the difference between a dead phone and a not-dead phone. It’s the size of an oldey-timey lipstick case and delivers a partial charge to any USB-C phone. We tested it out and awarded it a spot in our guide to power banks. The current discount only applies to the black colorway, and this is a few dollars higher than the all-time low of $16 it hit for Black Friday.\nJLab Go Sport+ workout earbuds for $19 ($11 off): Anyone looking for a cheap set of beater earbuds for the gym should check this out. It’s a recommendation in our guide to the best budget wireless earbuds and offers a solid eight-to-nine hours of battery life, passable (if somewhat compressed) sound and a water-resistant, around-the-ear design.\nAmazon Echo Buds for $20 (60 percent off with Prime): In our guide to the best budget earbuds, we called Amazon’s latest earbuds the best option for an open-ear design. That means they don’t go all the way in your ear canal, which is far more comfortable for some people. They’re sturdy, comfortable and the sound is decent once you’ve fiddled with the EQ settings to bring down the treble. This matches a previous low price — but is a bit more than a temporary Lightning deal for $15 that hit early on Tuesday.\nTP-Link Kasa Smart Bulbs for (four pack) for $22 (31 percent off with Prime): After testing a bunch of bulbs we deemed these the best value. Installation is easy, even for those new to smart devices, thanks to Kasa’s clean and simple app. Just note that voice control is only available with Alexa or the Google Assistant; Siri is unfortunately incompatible with these.\nAnker USB-C Cable 240W Bio-Braided for $13 ($6 off with Prime): We recommend this in our guide to iPhone accessories. It’s a reliable cable that’s durable and capable of fast charging (provided you have the right wall adapters). This matches its price in past sales.\nKasa TP-Link Smart Wi-FI outdoor plug for $17 ($8 off with Prime): We tested this one for our buying guide to smart plugs and named it the best outdoor pick for HomeKit users — but it’ll work with Alexa and the Google Assistant too. The range was decent and setup was easy, like most TP-Link plugs. Grab this now and have automatic control of your holiday lights.\nBlink Mini 2 security camera for $20 ($20 off with Prime): If you only want one Blink security camera, snag this deal. But if you can spring for a two-pack at $35, it's actually a better deal. Either way, it's our pick for the best budget security camera. Just note it requires a subscription for person detection and cloud storage, and the image quality wasn’t the best of the bunch. \nAmazon Fire TV Stick HD for $18 ($17 off with Prime): We name this the best budget streaming stick on our list of the best streaming devices. It's easy to set up and so you can access all of the major streaming platforms. Just note that it only streams content at 1080p, not 4K and the UI is more ad-heavy than competing streamers.\nApple AirTag for $20 ($9 off): Here’s our pick for a Bluetooth tracker for iPhone users. These little discs have the most accurate finding ability of any fob we tested, thanks to Apple’s vast Find My network that taps into all nearby iPhones to track down your missing stuff. They could be louder and hole would be nice, but nothing beats its accuracy. Just note that you'll get a cheaper per-tag price if you buy a four-pack. \nSamsung Fit Plus 56GB flash drive for $23 ($12 off): We named this the best thumbstick drive in our guide to the best SSDs. It has a sleek design, five-year warranty and has a USB 3.1 connection. There’s even a small attachment point for a keychain so you can take your extra storage drive with you when you go.\nJ-Tech Digital Ergonomic Mouse for $16 ($10 off with Prime and on-page coupon): The lowest price we’ve seen for one of our favorite ergonomic mice is $17 and now it’s even cheaper. This is the budget pick in our ergonomic mouse guide thanks to its vertical format, programmable buttons and nifty RBC lights (which you can turn off).\nThermacell E55 Rechargeable Repeller for $18 ($17 off with Prime): The mosquitos aren’t going anywhere. Even places that didn’t used to have these evil bloodsuckers are now overrun. If you would like some reprieve from the bites, this is the repeller we recommend in our guide to outdoor tech.\nTP-Link AC1200 WiFi extender for $20 ($10 off): If you’ve got some dead spots in your home’s internet coverage and aren’t quite ready for a mesh setup, a Wi-Fi extender can help. This is our favorite budget option in our guide to these plug-in devices thanks to its easy setup and user-friendly app.\nAmazon Echo Pop for $22 ($18 off with Prime): The smallest (and cheapest) Echo speaker is ideal for small apartments or rooms. The half-sphere design comes in purple and teal in addition to the standard black and white colorways. It's gone as low as $18 in past Prime Day sales. \nSoundcore Select 4 Go Bluetooth speaker for $19 ($16 off with Prime): One of the newest additions to our guide to the best Bluetooth speakers is this ‘lil guy from Soundcore (Anker). We found it had decent sound quality and was loud enough to fill a standard-sized living room. It's gone as low at $20 in the past.\nChipolo POP Bluetooth tracker for $25 ($4 off): The top pick in our guide to the best Bluetooth trackers was finally knocked off its throne — by another tracker from the same brand. This is our current recommendation for most people. It taps into either Apple’s Find My or Google’s Find My Device network (but just one at a time) and has a loud ring, quick Bluetooth connection and comes in fun colors.\nRoku Streaming Stick HD for $20 ($10 off): Roku just released two new streaming sticks this year. This standard model and the Plus model that supports 4K resolution. We recommend the latter in our guide to streaming sticks as the best way to catch free and live content, but if you don't have a 4K TV (or don't care about the resolution) you can grab this stick for 33 percent off. The Plus model is also on sale. \nThe best Prime Day tech deals under $35\n\n\nTP-Link Kasa Smart Plug Mini EP25 (4-pack) for $30 ($14 off with Prime): This is our favorite smart plug overall because it works with all four major smart home assistants (Alexa, Siri, Google Assistant and Samsung’s Bixby). In our tests, it connected easily and reliably controlled our lamps and other simple appliances.\nStar Wars Outlaws (Amazon Exclusive, PS5) for $29 ($31 off): At full price, this game was easy to skip. But now that it's available for just half price, it's a lot more compelling for Star Wars fans. The limited edition includes pre-order rewards like the Kessel Run bonus pack and the Rogue Infiltrator bundle.\n-> For more Prime Day gaming deals, check out our guide.\nRoku Streaming Stick Plus for $30 ($10 off): Roku replaced the Streaming Stick 4K with this model (which also supports 4K) earlier this year. We think it’s the best streaming stick for people who want to access free and live content on their TV. Roku’s interface is easy to use, colorful and lets you watch thousands of hours of free stuff, through Roku’s own content and more. You also get decently organized access to your paid content.\nAnker USB C Charger (Nano 65W) for $26 ($14 off with Prime): This is a similar model to the travel pick in our fast charger guide. It has three ports, two USB-C that deliver up to 65 watts each and a USB-A that can output 22 watts. That should refill your laptop, tablet and maybe some earbuds while not taking up too much space.\nAmazon Echo Dot Kids with Alexa for $32 ($28 off with Prime): The kids version of Amazon's smart speaker is the same hardware but with a kid-themed cover (owl or dragon) and it comes with a free year-long subscription to Amazon Kids+ with audiobooks, games and educational Alexa skills. The standard Echo Dot is on sale too, but we're disappointed in the sale price.  \nBlink Video Doorbell for $30 ($30 off with Prime): If you already use Alexa in your home and want a compatible video doorbell, you may want to check out this deal. Note that you’ll need a Blink subscription and a Blink Sync Module to store clips and to access other features. You can wire it to your existing doorbell wires or use it wirelessly with two AA batteries that can last up to two years.\nMoft Magnetic Phone Tripod for $32 ($8 off with Prime): I was impressed with how sturdily this small tripod held my phone. It folds down super thin but pops up to hold the phone in landscape or portrait orientation. The only downside is you’ll need to pop it off to wirelessly recharge (obviously) but removal and reattachment is quick.\nEarFun Free 2S wireless earbuds for $28 (30 percent off with Prime): These are fairly comfortable, have a good waterproof rating and deliver a decent amount of bass. They’re not going to deliver the fullest or most nuanced sound as more expensive buds, but for far less than $50, they’re a fine knockaround pair.\nAnker Soundcore 2 for $28 (38 percent off): The Soundcore 2 is an older bluetooth speaker, but it holds up — fully waterproof, with 24 hours of battery life and bass you can hear on the other side of a pool. It's on sale for less than $30. \n-> If you're looking for more speaker deals, check out our Prime Day speaker guide. \nThe best Prime Day tech deals under $50\n\n\nSoundcore by Anker Space A40 earbuds for $45 ($35 off with Prime): The top overall pick in our guide to the best budget earbuds delivers the kind of performance and features we’d expect from buds priced twice as high. These lil guys have effective active noise cancellation and a good battery life of eight hours — plus another 40 with the case.\nAnker 555 USB-C Hub (8-in-1) for $36 ($6 off with Prime): If you get a MacBook Air for Prime Day, you might find yourself needing more ports than the ultraportable offers. This is our favorite hub in our guide to MacBook accessories.  \nMoft Folding Sit-Stand Laptop Stand for $48 ($12 off with Prime): I take this with me when I have to work somewhere away from my standing desk. It holds a 16-inch MacBook Pro 10 inches off a desk, which is just enough for you to stand up and work. It also configures into four other positions for better ergonomics as you sit. It’s one of our favorite MacBook accessories.\nLexar Professional Silver Plus (512GB) for $38 ($35 off): We found this microSD card to be the best value of all the cards we tested. It consistently delivered faster sequential reads and writes than other models. If you need storage for your gaming handhels, camera, drone or other devices, may as well stock up now. \nAnker’s PowerConf C200 2K Webcam for $48 ($12 off with Prime): This deal matches the low from last Black Friday. It's the budget pick in our guide to the best webcams. If you want to bump up the look of your video calls, we think this will do the trick.\nHyperX Cloud Stinger 2 gaming headset for $37 ($14 off): In our guide to gaming headsets, we ultimately recommend getting an external mic along with a good pair of wired headphones for chatting. But if you really want a two-in-one, the Cloud Stinger 2 is our pick for a budget gaming headset.\nRazer Basilisk V3 gaming mouse for $36 ($34 off with Prime): Some prefer a wired connection when playing games. Razer’s Basilisk V3 is our top budget pick for a wired mouse in our gaming mouse guide. It’s comfortable, well-built, accurate and a good value — particularly with a Prime Day discount.\nLeebin Electric Spin Scrubber for $38 (46 percent off with Prime): This was Deputy Editor Valentina Palladino's favorite thing she bought last year because it makes the must-detested chore of cleaning her shower less of a pain. It's an electric spin scrubber that comes with multiple cleaning heads so you can use it on your countertops, sinks, tubs and showers and more. It also has an adjustable arm so you can reach tough spots in hard-to-reach places, and it convenient recharges via USB-C.\nAmazon Echo Buds with Active Noise Cancellation for $45 ($95 off with Prime): These buds are a bit old at this point, as they came out in 2021, but the 68 percent discount could be compelling. In our review, we said the buds were much improved over the last generation. They're more comfortable and have a better sound quality. Plus the Alexa integration makes them a decent pick for those who've gone all-in on Amazon's ecosystem. \nRing Pan-Tilt Indoor Cam for $40 ($40 off with Prime): This indoor security camera can spin 360 degrees and has a tilt range of 169 degrees so you can keep tabs on pets and other happenings at home. It'll let you drop in for a live view from your phone, and supports two-way talk for telling your pup to get off the couch.\nUGreen Revodok Pro 109 USB-C Hub for $32 ($22 off): The top pick in our guide to the best USB-C hubs has a good array of ports, including an HDMI 2.0 connection that supports 4K monitors at 60Hz, plus three USB-A ports, Ethernet and one USB-C (plus another for delivering 90W of power to your device. The hub has gone as low as $30 in prior sales. \nAmazfit Band 7 fitness tracker for $38 ($12 off with Prime): The runner up in our guide to the best, cheap fitness trackers has a comfortable design we found easy to sleep with and a great, mutli-week battery life. The screen isn’t as bright and it wasn’t quite as speedy as our top pick, but it does let you easily set custom goals.\nHamilton Beach Digital Programmable Rice Cooker for $40 ($10 off with Prime): Our top pick for a budget rice cooker is on sale for Prime members. The brown rice came out particularly good in our tests and the cooker is easy to clean with a dishwasher-safe cooker pot and steamer basket. Just note that it’s pretty small and doesn’t have the granular controls of pricer models.  \n-> See more kitchen tech Prime day deals in our guide. \nExpired deals\nBlink Outdoor 4 for $45 ($55 off): We named this outdoor camera the best for Alexa homes in our security cameras guide. It can go just about anywhere you want as the wireless design runs on AA batteries and can last for two years before needing to be replaced. The motion alerts are accurate, but keep in mind you’ll need a subscription to enable person detection and cloud storage.\nJBL Go 3 for $28 (30 percent off): The JBL Go 4 gets a shout out in our guide to Bluetooth speakers, this is its predecessor. It's got a carabiner-friendly design, five hours of battery life, and IP67-rated waterproofing and dustproofing. It's not exactly powerful, but it's way better than a phone speaker for driving, trekking or camping.\nAmazon Echo Buds for $15 (70 percent off with Prime): In our guide to the best budget earbuds, we called Amazon’s latest earbuds the best option for an open-ear design. That means they don’t go all the way in your ear canal, which is far more comfortable for some people. They’re sturdy, comfortable and the sound is decent once you’ve fiddled with the EQ settings to bring down the treble. This is a lightning deal and the lowest price we've seen yet.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-amazon-prime-day-deals-on-samsung-blink-anker-and-more-all-for-under-50-160028179.html?src=rss",
    "full_text": "The right-angle looks much neater than a straight cable, plus this one can shuttle up to 240 watts of power during charging. It’s the size of an oldey-timey lipstick case and delivers a partial charge to any USB-C phone. That means they don’t go all the way in your ear canal, which is far more comfortable for some people. Just note that it only streams content at 1080p, not 4K and the UI is more ad-heavy than competing streamers. This is the budget pick in our ergonomic mouse guide thanks to its vertical format, programmable buttons and nifty RBC lights (which you can turn off). We think it’s the best streaming stick for people who want to access free and live content on their TV. These lil guys have effective active noise cancellation and a good battery life of eight hours — plus another 40 with the case. Plus the Alexa integration makes them a decent pick for those who've gone all-in on Amazon's ecosystem. The motion alerts are accurate, but keep in mind you’ll need a subscription to enable person detection and cloud storage.

    "full_text": "Microsoft is now starting to change its Blue Screen of Death (BSOD) to a newly designed black version. It’s the first major change to the BSOD since Microsoft added a sad face to the screen in Windows 8, and Microsoft is now removing that frowning face and QR code in favor of a more simplified black screen. The new BSOD is rolling out to Windows 11 Release Preview users today, meaning it should appear for all Windows 11 users in a matter of weeks. The simplified BSOD looks a lot like the black screen you normally see during a Windows update. The new Black Screen of Death in Windows 11. It will list the stop code and faulty system driver, making it easier for Windows users and IT admins to see what’s causing a BSOD on a PC. “This is really an attempt on clarity and providing better information and allowing us and customers to really get to what the core of the issue is so we can fix it faster,” said David Weston, vice president of enterprise and OS security at Microsoft, in an interview with The Verge in June. Microsoft did briefly turn the BSOD to a black screen in test builds of Windows 11 in 2021 , but this time it’s making the change permanent. The change to the BSOD arrives as part of an update to Windows 11 that also includes Microsoft’s new Quick Machine Recovery (QMR) feature, which is designed to quickly restore machines that can’t boot properly. QMR is part of larger effort by Microsoft to improve the resiliency of Windows in the wake of last year’s CrowdStrike incident."

Some of Mockly’s templates are more believable than others. Another limitation at play is that Mockly is mostly reproducing what conversations on these platforms would look like on the web, and not on mobile. Maybe it’s for the best if Mockly’s fake message generator is not 100% perfect. People still can and will be duped by fake message screenshots. But it is widely known that it’s possible to fake an image of a DM conversation, and people on social media are mostly primed to question the legitimacy of a DM screenshot. In the age of AI, where synthetic videos of world events are going viral and creating widespread disinformation … perhaps we have bigger fish to fry."

First of all, this watch is primarily for those already tied into Samsung's ecosystem. If you use an iPhone, this might not be the best match. Also, the always-on display is a notorious battery hog.

They will essentially perform “the upfront work” to determine which assets are good candidates for an orbital mission, and what conditions to put them through in space, Varda co-founder Delian Asparouhov explained in an interview with TechCrunch. “The company can go and do process engineering to understand at what temperatures and what conditions do the biologics crystallize ahead of time, so that when we get up in orbit the bioreactor knows what to do,” Asparouhov said.

Asparouhov is a partner at Founders Fund, the firm Thiel co-founded 20 years ago, and he was previously a principal at Khosla. Varda has launched and returned three successful missions so far since 2023; the company anticipates completing four missions this year alone.

    "summary": "Apple fans already know that you don't generally find sales on Apple’s own website — but Amazon is more than happy to discount Apple gear, particularly during Prime Day (just note that you won't find new, unlocked iPhones on Amazon). On day three of the sale (it ends on Friday), we're still seeing new all-time lows on the entry-level iPad and iPad Air, the AirPods Pro 2 and the Apple Watch Series 10. And so far, not much has gone out of stock. Read on for best Prime Day deals on Apple gear — we also linked out to our reviews so you can read up before you buy.\nBest Prime Day iPad deals\n\n\nApple iPad (A16) for $280 ($69 off): The latest edition of Apple’s standard iPad isn’t powerful enough to run Apple Intelligence, but we don’t think that’s an issue. In his review, Enadget’s Jeff Dunn praised the tablet’s speed, calling it “plenty fast” for browsing the web, streaming video, editing photos and playing most games. It’s the most affordable iPad (especially now) and it easily handles the basics. This is a new all-time low price.  \nApple iPad Air (11-inch, M3) for $479 ($120 off): In our opinion, the iPad Air is the best iPad for most people as it strikes an ideal balance between performance, price and features. The M3 chip is almost overkill for a tablet, but it means performance should never be an issue. And upcoming productivity gains from iPadOS 26 should make the tablet even more powerful. This is the lowest price we've seen so far for this model, and it's still in stock. \nApple iPad Mini (A17 Pro) for $379 ($120 off): Apple’s smallest iPad earned an 83 review score from us when it came out late last year. Despite its compact size, it’s still a fully-featured iPad, with support for accessories and a laminated, anti-reflective screen. It’s not a laptop-replacer, but rather the perfect couch companion, handling games, video, web browsing and email triage. This deal is the cheapest the mini has ever been.  \nApple iPad Air (13-inch, M3) for $679 ($120 off): This is Apple’s most affordable large-screen iPad. Engadget’s Nate Ingraham awarded it a review score of 89 upon its debut this March. When you pair it with accessories like a keyboard folio and mouse, it becomes a true productivity machine — though those add-ons make it a pricey package. Good thing iPads are on sale for Prime Day. This $120 discount matches the lowest price we've seen over the past couple months.  \nApple iPad Pro (11-inch, M4) for $899 ($100 off): We named the iPad Pro the best tablet money can buy. The screen is one of the best we’ve seen and Apple somehow managed to make the Pro model lighter than Air models. If you plan on handling heavy productivity — video rendering and editing, machine learning apps and the like, this is the way to go.\nBest Prime Day AirPod deals\n\n\nAirPods Max (USB-C) for $430 ($119 off): Apple’s only over-ear headphones are due for an update. The company outfitted the AirPods Max with a USB-C port late last year, but the internals haven’t had an overhaul since 2020. Still, we named them the best (and only) over-ear AirPods. They are comfortable and relatively lightweight, have a balanced sound and the noise cancellation is solid. The headphones dipped down to $399 (in starlight) on Tuesday, but have now popped back up to $430.\nAirPods 4 (with ANC) for $119 ($60 off): Apple introduced the fourth generation of its basic earbuds alongside the iPhone 16 last September. This model includes ANC — a first for Apple’s “regular” buds — and Billy awarded them an 86 in his review. Just note they don’t have a fully closed design like the Pro models — but some may prefer the open fit, which Apple completely redesigned to fit more securely.\nAirPods 4 (without ANC) for $89 ($40 off): Apple introduced two models of its fourth generation basic earbuds alongside the iPhone 16 last September. This one doesn't have the extra features of ANC or Transparency Mode (which makes them cheaper). This pared down model benefits from a shape redesign — which our headphone expert, Billy Steele, found both more comfortable and more secure — as well as improved sound quality that’s more immersive than before.\nBest Prime Day MacBook deals\n\n\nMacBook Air (M4, 13-inch) for $849 ($150 off): Engadget’s Devindra Hardawar named the M4 MacBook Air the best laptop overall. It’s remarkably thin and light, with an excellent battery life, and the M4 chip is powerful, making this an ideal ultraportable productivity machine. Apple reduced the starting price by $100 compared to the last MacBook Air, and this deal only makes it an even better buy.\nMacBook Air (M4, 15-inch) for $1,049 ($150 off): If you want a little more screen real estate, go for the 15-inch Air. Devindra found the screen more immersive than the smaller model, and only slightly less portable. The slightly larger battery gave it a few more minutes of life. Whichever size you go for, the MacBook Air will be able to handle all but the most demanding rendering tasks without breaking a sweat.\nMacBook Air (15-inch, M3, 24GB RAM) for $1,249 ($450 off with coupon): This higher-specced version of the M3 MacBook Air from last year has a 15-inch screen and a little extra internal memory. We gave the 15-inch model a score of 90 in our review when it came out in early 2024. Outside of its older M3 chip (which is still plenty fast for everyday use), marginally improved camera and inability to power two external displays with the lid open, this MacBook is virtually identical to the M4 version. Note this discount applies to the Starlight colorway and you'll need to click the on-page coupon to get the full deal. \nWe found a few non-Apple laptops on sale for Prime Day, too.  \nBest Prime Day Apple Watch deals\n\n\nApple Watch Series 10 for $279 ($120 off): Apple only announced one new smartwatch last September and this is it. It’s a little wider than the Series 9, but thanks to a slimmer design, it doesn’t feel clunky. The health and fitness tracking is still better than most smartwatches out there and the integration with an iPhone is seamless. There’s a reason it’s our favorite smartwatch overall. This is the lowest price we've ever tracked on the wearable, though throughout the day, Amazon has been oscillating between limiting the deal to Prime members and opening the price to anyone.  \nApple Watch SE for $169 (32 percent off): We wouldn’t be surprised to see an update to Apple’s budget smartwatch sometime soon (and we have a few suggestions on the matter). But thanks to some serious discounts, the Apple Watch SE has turned out to be the most affordable way to get an iPhone companion for your wrist. Despite the lackluster screen and limited extra features, it handles the basics well.\nApple Watch Ultra 2 for $650 ($149 off with Prime): The second generation of Apple’s premium smartwatch came out in 2023 along with the iPhone 15 (last September it just got a new Titanium Black colorway. The Ultra model is geared towards serious athletes and outdoor adventurers, packing specialized features like a 40-meter depth gauge, dual-frequency GPS and an on-board siren.\nBest Prime Day deals on Apple accessories\n\n\nApple Pencil (USB-C) for $59 ($20 off): Before you buy an Apple Pencil, check this compatibility page to make sure it’ll work with your model and generation of iPad. To say the least, it’s confusing. This model has the widest compatibility, but note that it doesn’t charge through its magnetic attachment, you’ll need to use the USB-C for refilling it.  \nApple Pencil Pro for $99 ($30 off): Apple announced the Pro version of its pencil at the same time as the iPad Pro with the M4 chip. It adds haptic feedback, squeeze gestures and roll capabilities to the usual stylus tricks. It works with the newest iPad Pro, Air and Mini models.\nApple Pencil (2nd gen) for $90 ($39 off): The Second gen Pencil both attaches and charges magnetically, supports tilt and pressure sensitivity and allows for tool changes with a tap of the flat edge. It’s an older pencil and isn’t compatible with the latest iPad models. This is the lowest price we’ve tracked this year, but it went as low as $80 for last year’s Black Friday sales.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-prime-day-apple-deals-on-airpods-ipads-macbooks-and-more-for-day-three-of-amazons-sale-150005681.html?src=rss",

The company […]",
    "full_text": "His work has appeared in The New York Daily News and City & State. Musk acknowledged that the company is still waiting on “regulatory approval,” which hints at the uphill climb company Tesla will face in pushing this process forward. Right now, Tesla only has one of these permits: testing with a safety driver. If Tesla wants its service to look similar to the one it launched last month in Austin — driverless, but with a safety monitor in the driver seat; paid rides, but invite only — it will also need to obtain these additional DMV permits. That’s a lot of hoops to jump through, and a stark contrast from Texas, where all that was required was proof of insurance. They may want to know how active a role its remote operators play in each vehicle’s operation. If anything goes wrong, California could come in and revoke Tesla’s robotaxi permits. That’s what happened to Cruise when the company’s employees failed to disclose an incident in which one of its vehicles dragged a woman several feet after she was struck in a hit-and-run. The last time Tesla submitted a disengagement report was 2019, when it reported driving only 12.2 miles autonomously as part of demo around its then-Palo Alto headquarters. Tesla hasn’t submitted any reports since then, arguing that its testing is focused on Level 2 driving."

    "full_text": "Bluesky is adding age verification to its platform in the UK as part of efforts to comply with the country’s Online Safety Act. In an update on Thursday, the platform says it will let users verify their age by scanning their face, uploading an ID, or entering a payment card. Bluesky will perform age verification through Kid Web Services (KWS), an Epic Games-owned tool that developers can use to implement age verification and parental controls on their platforms. If users don’t want to verify their age, or if they’re under 18, they will still be able to have an account with certain features limited. Bluesky will block “adult-appropriate content” and turn off certain features, such as direct messaging. Image: Bluesky The UK passed the Online Safety Act in 2023, which privacy advocates have warned will “lead to a much more censored, locked-down internet for British users.” Another part of the law is coming into force on July 25th, requiring sites and apps containing porn and harmful content to provide “highly effective age assurance.” Platforms that don’t comply with the new rules will face fines of up to £18 million ($24 million) or 10 percent of their worldwide revenue, whichever is higher. Once the age requirements take effect, Bluesky says it will show a notification to users in the UK asking them to verify their age. Based on the images shared by Bluesky, it looks like UK users will first have to register their email with KWS, which will send them instructions on how to verify their age. “In addition to these updates, we’ll continue to look at how we’re doing to shield children from unwanted content, and how we can improve,” Bluesky writes in the update."

    "summary": "Amazon Prime Day is always a good time to buy a camera as it helps make a major purchase far more palatable. If you've been looking to upgrade your current equipment or get one as a gift, there are a large number of stellar deals available.\nMany of those deals come from the major brands including Sony, Canon, DJI, GoPro and Fujifilm — including some pulled straight from from our most recent camera guide. You may want to peruse that post for more info as you add items to your cart. With all that said, here are the best Prime Day camera deals we could find for day three of the sale.. \nBest Prime Day camera deals\n\n\nCanon EOS R100 with RT-S18-45mm lens for $549 (15 percent off): Canon's EOS R100 is the only modern mirrorless camera you can get with a kit lens for under $600. It comes with a 24-megapixel APS-C sensor that delivers great picture quality with Canon's pleasing skin tones.\nCanon EOS R50 with RF-S18-45mm lens for $749 (15 percent off): Canon's 24-megapixel APS-C EOS R50 is great for travel, parties, street photography and more thanks to the portable size and built-in flash. It offers nice image quality with warm, human friendly photos and is capable for creators as well with 4K 30fps supersampled video, with 10-bit and HDR capability.\nOM System OM-5 for $899 (25 percent off): For creators on a budget, the 20-megapixel, Micro Four Thirds OM-5 from OM System (formerly Olympic) is a great option at this price. It lets you shoot 4K video and 20MP stills at up to 10 fps. The design is nice with a full complement of manual controls, a fully articulating display and 7.5 stops of built-in stabilization.\nPanasonic Lumix S9 for $1,298 (13 percent off): The S9 may be Panasonic's smallest full-frame camera but it comes with the same 24MP sensor and similar video features to the popular S5 II. To that end, it offers up to 6.2K video, in-body stabilization and reliable autofocus. The key feature though is a special LUT button that lets you easily choose a custom cinematic look designed by professional creators.\nCanon EOS R6 Mark II for $1,899 (5 percent off): Canon's R6 Mark II offers a great mix of video and photography features. You can now shoot RAW stills at up to 40 fps and video specs are equally solid with sharp full-sensor 4K at up to 60 fps. It comes with in-body stabilization that's great for video and photos and autofocus is quicker and more versatile than ever.\nNikon Z6 III for $2,197 (12 percent off): Nikon's Z6 III is the best hybrid mirrorless camera for the money, thanks to the incredible performance of the 24-megapixel partially stacked sensor. You can shoot RAW bursts at up to 20 fps in electronic shutter mode while nailing sharp shots thanks to the much-improved autofocus. On the video side, it supports 6K RAW at up to 60 fps, or 4K 120p. All of that makes it ideal for creators and photographers alike, with the only drawback being the reduced resolution. \nSony A7 IV for $2,198 (19 percent off): It beats many rivals with 33 megapixels of resolution rather than 24, with image quality much improved overall. Video is now up to par with rivals with 4K at up to 60p with 10 bit 4:2:2 quality. Autofocus is incredible for both video and stills, and the in-body stabilization does a good job. The biggest drawback is rolling shutter that limits the use of the electronic shutter.\nCanon EOS R5 Mark II for $3,999 ($300 off): It's company’s best camera in years thanks to improvements in areas like autofocus and video. It comes with a high-resolution 45-megapixel stacked sensor, but still lets you shoot blackout-free bursts at up to 30 fps — and most of the shots will be sharp thanks to the updated autofocus with AI tracking. Video is also strong with up to 8K 60p RAW and 4K 120 fps shooting. \nBest Prime Day action cam and drone deals\n\n\nDJI Osmo Action 4 for $209 (30 percent off): DJI's Osmo Action 4 is a tremendous deal at this price, as you're not giving up much in comparison to the most recent model, the Action 5. It has the same big 1/1.3-inch sensor that delivers excellent video quality, especially in low light. It also features a D-LogM profile to boost dynamic range, DJI's excellent clip-on mount and high-quality 4K 120p video.\nDJI Osmo Mobile 7P gimbal for $125 (15 percent off): This three-axis gimbal keeps your smartphone video as smooth as can be with DJI's ActiveTrack 7.0, and includes a magnetic snapping mechanism so you can install your mobile device in seconds. The latest feature is native tracking that follows you around, thanks to the included Multifunctional Module. \nDJI Mini 4K drone for $309 (21 percent off): The Mini 4 weighs less than 249 grams so it doesn't require a permit, but can still shoot 4K video at up to 30 fps or 2.7K at 60 fps with three-axis stabilization. It can fly up to 31 minutes on a charge and has one-tap movements like dronie, helix and panoramic shooting.\nGoPro Hero 13 Black for $329 (23 percent off): GoPro’s Hero 13 Black is now available with a new family of modular lenses called the HB series (ultra-wide, anamorphic and macro), making it far more versatile for action creators. It also has a slightly bigger battery that allows longer capture times, up to 90 minutes for 4K 30fps video. Other specs remain the same, including up to 5.3K at 60fps in 10-bit color, along with the excellent Hypersmooth stabilization. \nInsta360 X4 for $349 (30 percent): Insta360 simply dominates the 360-degree category, thanks to its ability to capture action at up to 8K 30fps or 5.7K at 60fps — providing more detail when you reframe it to 16:9. At the same time, the Me Mode that produces flat video (with automatic selfie stick removal) has been upgraded from a maximum 2.7K 30fps to 4K 30fps. It also offers solid battery life, waterproofing to 10m and a free editing app. \nBest Prime Day deals on camera accessories\n\n\nK&F Concept 25L backpack for $50 (17 percent off): A large 25L three-tiered camera bag that can hold multiple cameras, lenses and drones. It has quick side access and features durable materials with a rain cover, making it great for outdoor travel, weddings or vlogging.\nLexar 256GB Professional Silver Pro V60 memory card for $51 (32 percent off): An excellent compromise between speed and value with up to 280MB/s read and 160MB/s write speeds. \nSmallRig 71-inch Camera Tripod with 360 ball head for $56 (20 percent off): Two-in-one tripod monopod with a head that adjusts 360 degrees so you can take photos at any angle horizontally or vertically. \nElgato Key Light 2800 lumens for $140 (22 percent off): For presentations or simple studio shoots, you get a silent, low-heat studio light with high output and a 2900-7000K temperature range. It's controllable by WiFi and has an opal glass face for glare-free diffusion. \nElgato Prompter for $190 (37 percent off): Whether you're a creator on YouTube or present on Zoom, the Elgato Prompter is an elegant and popular choice thanks to the built-in display that allows you to read scripts while looking at the camera. Support more cameras than ever, even with wide lenses and features an easy setup. \nExpired deals\nDJI Neo drone for $159 (20 percent off): The DJI Neo may be an inexpensive, beginner-friendly drone, but has powerful features like subject tracking and quick shots. It can shoot video at up to 4K 30 fps and is quick and maneuverable, though it's also fairly loud. You can also grab one with three batteries and a charger for $229 (21 percent off).This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cameras/the-best-amazon-prime-day-camera-deals-you-can-still-get-right-now-104502326.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "It’s nice to see Samsung offer something new for 2025. For the last few years, the company has been updating existing designs for its annual refreshes, especially its most premium soundbar, the Q990. I was pleasantly surprised to see something entirely new when the company debuted the QS700F ($700) at CES. This model doesn’t have the immersive sound that its more expensive sibling offers, but there are several handy features, including the ability to adapt to whichever way you place it.\nFor all of its might, the QS700F only beams Dolby Atmos in a 3.1.2-channel speaker configuration. Eight total drivers provide the sound here, significantly less than what blasts the 11.1.4-channel sound on the all-in-one Q990F. But the QS700F costs half as much, and for people who live in smaller spaces or have smaller living rooms, this more affordable, adaptable model will serve you just fine. \n\n\nDesign\nWith the QS700F, Samsung nixed the extra angles from the Q990F since there are no side-firing drivers here. This gives the soundbar a simplified, brick-like rectangular shape that’s less of a distraction in front of your TV. The QS700F is also shorter when laid horizontally on a table or mantle, which means it doesn’t block your TV.\nAround the sides and back, Samsung opted to use a rigid, circularly perforated speaker grille that wraps the entire surface. Up top, there’s a more refined, horizontal cover that gives the soundbar a more sophisticated look. It also means that you’ll be getting the speaker’s best-looking side when you flip and rotate it to mount it on a wall. While the included wireless subwoofer won’t win any design awards, it’s a compact unit at just under 10 inches square.\nTo keep the look clean, Samsung put its logo on the side rather than on the front. It also kept the onboard controls simple, which is important since they’re prominently displayed if the soundbar is wall mounted. The buttons are basic icons for source, volume and power, colored so they blend in nicely even when they’re in plain sight. Around back, you’ll find the wired connections: an HDMI input (eARC), one HDMI output and an optical port.\nLike most soundbars, the QS700F features some LEDs on the front as a visual cue when you’re adjusting volume or making other tweaks. However, when you raise or lower the volume, there’s a mini light show that’s obnoxious. A single blinking LED for each time you press a button would suffice. There’s also an LED that blinks when the soundbar is muted, which I also think is a step too much. You might think you can avoid seeing these if you use the soundbar in its other orientation, but I regret to inform you that there’s another set of LEDs on the top that appear if the QS700F is wall-mounted.\nSoftware and features\n\n\n\n\n  Billy Steele for Engadget\n \n\nThere are a number of features to discuss on the QS700F, but the most important one is called Convertible Fit. The soundbar has an accelerometer inside that detects whether you’ve placed the speaker flat or if you’ve mounted it on a wall. It will then automatically adjust which drivers the front- and up-firing channels are coming from. The positioning of the drivers inside ensures that up-firing units are angled correctly and beaming sound out into the room in both positions. Convertible Fit works really well, and I couldn’t tell a huge difference in audio quality between the two orientations. It sounded like the center channel (vocals and dialog) was slightly louder in the wall-mount position, but it wasn’t too much of a distraction.\nOther notable tools include wireless Dolby Atmos with compatible TVs and Wi-Fi connectivity powers AirPlay, Chromecast, Spotify Connect, Roon Service and Tidal Connect. Interestingly, the QS700F doesn’t work with Samsung’s virtual assistant Bixby for voice controls. Instead, you’ll employ Google Assistant through Google Home for that purpose.\nThen there are the handy features that require a Samsung TV, which you’ll need to consider since they’re major functions of the soundbar. First up is Samsung’s Q-Symphony tech, which allows you to use TV speakers in unison with the soundbar. The company says this produces “more robust and nuanced sound,” and that it can also enhance clarity with certain models of its AI-equipped TVs. As I don’t have a Samsung TV, I wasn’t able to test this, but I don’t see how more speakers could ever be a bad thing.\nYou can only use Samsung’s SpaceFit Sound Pro room calibration if you have one of its TVs with a built-in microphone. The QS700F doesn’t have a mic for this purpose, so you’ll have to settle for the stock tuning if you don’t own one of the required displays. You’ll also miss out on Active Voice Amplifier Pro as this model doesn’t support the more robust dialog adjustment. There is a Voice Enhance Mode on the QS700F, but it’s not as powerful. Hoping to use wireless Dolby Atmos? It’ll only work with 2022-2025 Samsung TVs — making it yet another company-exclusive feature.\nOne more place the QS700F falls behind Samsung’s flagship Q990F soundbar is video passthrough. The latter offers 4K at 120Hz while the QS700F only manages 4K at 60Hz. I realize this won’t matter for a lot of people, but for gamers and movie buffs, this will be disappointing.\nLike other recent Samsung soundbars, the QS700F can be controlled via the SmartThings app. It contains all kinds of presets, settings and other options, including the ability to adjust channel output, fine-tune audio sync and switch inputs. Since most of what you’ll do here pertains to audio performance, I’ll discuss the app more later.\nSound quality\n\n\n\n\n  Billy Steele for Engadget\n \n\nThe QS700F offers 3.1.2-channel audio with support for Dolby Atmos and DTS Virtual:X. Thanks to the up-firing drivers, this is true Atmos sound, unlike on some soundbars that only offer a virtualized version of the immersive audio. Across eight speakers in the soundbar, the QS700F has three main channels and two up-firing channels. And, of course, the “1” in the middle is the wireless subwoofer.\nOverall, sound from the QS700F is crisp and clear, providing ample detail for movies and music alike. Despite the smaller package, the compact sub still produces plenty of booming bass, so there’s lots of thunder for action scenes in Top Gun: Maverick. The soundbar also capably handled all of the directional audio in Formula 1: Drive to Survive. I did notice that the overall sense of immersion wasn’t as high as the Sonos Arc Ultra I just moved out to install the QS700F. That’s not really surprising, but it did highlight the limits of 3.1.2-channel soundbars. They’re good enough for smaller spaces with four right angles, but taller ceilings and irregular rooms really need more channels and rear speakers.\nIn music, vocals are prominent through the center channels, and for some listeners, they may be overly so. You can adjust this in the app, but I didn’t mind it. Highs, mids and lows are all appropriately present, with the subwoofer bumping along when a song calls for it. If you’re hoping the QS700F can serve as your music setup in addition to boosting TV audio, you’ll be well served by the soundbar. And as I already mentioned, it supports a variety of methods for beaming tunes from your phone without having to get off the couch.\nThere are a number of sound modes to help you find the right tuning for your content. Those include Surround, Game Pro, Adaptive, DTS Virtual:X and Standard. I found Adaptive to be best suited for all-around use since it automatically adjusts the audio based on the content being played. And unless you really want to mess around with the settings on a regular basis, Adaptive allows you to “set it and forget it” while still letting the QS700F’s sonic prowess shine.\nIn the “Advanced Sound Settings,” there are options for voice and bass enhancement as well as the handy Night Mode that makes low frequencies less boomy when someone in your home is sleeping. There are also settings for Moderate Bass, which delivers “deep, rich bass sound,” and Virtual that simulates a wider soundstage in the absence of rear speakers. You can clearly hear that the presets and modes all change the audio to some degree when enabled, so their utility will likely depend on when and where you’re using the QS700F.\nThe competition\n\n\n\n  Sonos Beam (Gen 2)\n \n\n  Devindra Hardawar for Engadget\n \n\nSamsung and Sony both have new 3.1.2-channel Dolby Atmos soundbars for 2025. Of course, Sony’s Theater Bar 6 doesn’t do the neat orientation trick that the QS700F does, but there is still a number of direct similarities between the two. They both come with a subwoofer in the box and offer various sound modes. Dolby Atmos and DTS:X audio on the Bar 6 is greatly aided by up-firing speakers and Sony’s virtual surround sound tech. And like Samsung, there are certain features that require one of the company’s TVs — like the AI-powered Voice Zoom 3 dialog boost. At $650, Sony’s soundbar won’t save you much over the QS700F at full price.\nLet’s not forget about Sonos. The second-gen Beam is the closest thing to the QS700F in the company’s lineup, but there are some caveats. The Beam doesn’t have up-firing speakers, so the Atmos sound is entirely virtualized, and you can tell the difference. You do get the benefit of TV Audio Swap with the Ace headphones, but you have to contend with the ongoing battle that is Sonos’ app overhaul. The newer Beam is cheaper at $499, but adding a subwoofer that you’ll most certainly want costs another $429 (Sub Mini) or $700 (Sub 4). That add-on makes this option much pricier than the QS700F.\nWrap-up\nThe QS700F is a breath of fresh air in Samsung’s home theater lineup, offering something new when it’s flagship Q990 model only got a modest refresh. Sure, some of the handiest features require one of the company’s TVs, but that’s how Samsung and some of the competition have operated for years now. The biggest item you’ll miss out on there is room calibration, especially if you plan to use the QS700F in a space with high ceilings or lots of angles.\nCaveats aside, the best thing about the soundbar is its automatic orientation adjustment. This gives you a second option for installation down the road if your TV and/or its location change before you’re ready to upgrade your audio setup. The QS700F is easy on the eyes too, which isn’t always the case with these devices. So, in the end, the combination of features, design and audio performance make this soundbar a worthy contender at the top end of the midrange, if you’re willing to live with the limitations of Dolby Atmos in 3.1.2.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/samsung-hw-qs700f-soundbar-review-sophisticated-design-automatic-adjustments-180035549.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Prime Day is basically Black Friday for Amazon’s own devices. For almost as long as the shopping event has taken place (it started in July 2015, if you forgot), it’s been one of the most reliable days of the year to snag Amazon gadgets like Kindles Echo speakers and Fire tablets at dirt-cheap prices. Amazon has regular sales all the time, but if you still shell out $139 annually for Prime, it’s in your best interest to wait until mid-July to grab gear that Amazon makes itself. That’s still accurate this year, too — for the most part.\nBut not for the Echo Dot. Yes, it’s on sale this year for $32. But that discounted price offends me personally — and it should offend you, too. The humble little orb of a smart speaker got the short end of the stick for Prime Day 2025. For reference, the latest edition of the Echo Dot was $23 last July Prime Day, and $23 again during the Black Friday period in 2024.\nWhile a $9 difference may not seem like much, it’s a slap in the face for Prime subscribers who have come to expect the exclusive deals available to them during this arbitrary shopping event to be just as much of a perk of their membership as access to Prime Video, free two-day delivery and the like. It’s worse that Amazon devices are the usual suspects when it comes to Hella Good Deals on Prime Day. If the Prime Day deal on the Echo Dot sucks, that means we can’t reliably expect any of Amazon’s devices to be down to record-low prices during this event.\nThis, of course, matters not one bit to Amazon. Why the company decided to punish would-be Echo Dot purchasers this time around and not Kindle or Fire TV buyers will likely remain a mystery to us. But considering the uncertainty surrounding tariffs in the US and the steady flow of rising prices on tech as a direct result of that, one theory I have is that Amazon is testing its customers.\nIf Engadget's historical Prime Day data is anything to go on, the Echo Dot is an extremely popular purchase — and Amazon likely knows that. If enough customers OK this objectively bad deal by purchasing the Echo Dot at $32 a pop, that signals to Amazon that it can continue to offer bad discounts on its devices without repercussions. I hesitate to say the days of a $23 Echo Dot are totally behind us, but they could be depending on how things go this summer.\nThat said, the best alternative to the Echo Dot this Prime Day is the Echo Spot for $45. Amazon revived that smart alarm clock last year and, while I don’t think it will boot the Echo Dot out of the speaker lineup any time soon, there’s an argument for such a replacement considering Amazon now also has the ultra-cheap Echo Pop. Regardless, if you were hoping to buy an Echo Dot on discount during Prime Day, I recommend skipping it and opting for the Spot or the Pop instead.\nIn addition, here are some Prime Day deals that are actually worth your time and money that all come in at $32 or less:\n\nThis $23 handheld fan that has already saved me from melting this year in the New York City summer heat.\nThe $18 Amazon Fire TV Stick HD that we recently named our favorite budget streaming device.\nA $16 Samsung Galaxy SmartTag 2, a favorite Bluetooth tracker of ours if you're a Samsung fan but also have a habit of losing things like your wallet or keys.\nA $20 AirTag, if you're also prone to losing things but identify as an iOS stan.\nThis $14 Anker wireless charging stand that's super basic, gets the job done and lets you power up your phone in either portrait or landscape mode.\nThis $19 Soundcore speaker that's a little larger than palm-sized and sounds pretty decent for its size.\nThese $22 Kasa smart bulbs that are hard to beat if you're looking for no-brainer IoT devices to start your smart home ecosystem.\nThis $13 Anker USB-C charging adapter because, if you're like me, you need to have one of these in basically every room so you can always charge your phone.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/you-definitely-should-not-buy-an-echo-dot-this-prime-day-113023104.html?src=rss",

These arrests are part of an investigation into a series of cyberattacks on three large UK retailers — Marks & Spencer, Harrods and Co-op — earlier this year.\nUK investigators believe the suspects are connected with a loose-knit English-speaking hacker group called Scattered Spider, which has been blamed for a series of high-profile incidents. For Co-op, this was the second such incident this year, after a hacking group called DragonForce gained access to the retailer's membership data. Scattered Spider was implicated in 2023 when US-based casino chain Caesars Entertainment reportedly paid tens of millions of dollars to the group in order to keep its customers’ data from being exposed.\nMarks & Spencer was attacked in April and was forced to shut down its online store for over a month.

    "full_text": "The National Crime Agency (NCA) in London has arrested two 19-year-old men, a 17-year-old boy and a 20-year-old woman on suspicion of blackmail, money laundering, organized crime and contravening the Computer Misuse Act . These arrests are part of an investigation into a series of cyberattacks on three large UK retailers — Marks & Spencer, Harrods and Co-op — earlier this year. UK investigators believe the suspects are connected with a loose-knit English-speaking hacker group called Scattered Spider, which has been blamed for a series of high-profile incidents . For Co-op, this was the second such incident this year , after a hacking group called DragonForce gained access to the retailer's membership data. Scattered Spider was implicated in 2023 when US-based casino chain Caesars Entertainment reportedly paid tens of millions of dollars to the group in order to keep its customers’ data from being exposed. Marks & Spencer was attacked in April and was forced to shut down its online store for over a month. Co-op fell victim the same month in an attack that led to a partial shutdown of its IT system. Harrods disclosed on May 1 that it had staved off an attempted attack by restricting internet access across its websites. \"Since these attacks took place, specialist NCA cybercrime investigators have been working at pace and the investigation remains one of the agency’s highest priorities,\" said Paul Foster , head of the NCA's national cybercrime unit.

    "summary": "The Meta Quest 3s virtual reality headset is on sale as part of Amazon Prime Day, and it's still in stock even now as we're more than half way through the event. The 128GB model is down to $249, which is $50 off, and the 256GB version now costs $329, which is a discount of $70. These are both record-low prices. It's also worth noting that the 256GB model comes with a digital copy of Batman: Arkham Shadow.\nThis made our list of the best virtual reality headsets and it's the perfect entry point for budget-conscious consumers. For the uninitiated, the Quest 3s is a pared-down version of the flagship Quest 3. It looks nearly identical to the OG model and keeps the same hardware specifications. It boasts the same Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 processor and 8GB of RAM. \n\n\nMeta did have to cut corners on the lenses a bit. The 3s doesn't have the nifty pancake lenses of its more expensive sibling, but the Fresnel lenses get the job done. It also ships with the same Touch Controllers, which we found to be light and comfortable. The joysticks feel smooth and accurate and the buttons are responsive.\nThis can run all of the software that the Quest 3 can run, so newcomers will have access to a robust catalog of games and experiences. The only major downside is that the 3s lacks a headphone jack, so folks will have to plug in a USB-C adapter for more immersive audio. I highly recommend doing this. The external speakers are fine, but VR is all about total immersion.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-meta-quest-3s-is-still-in-stock-and-down-to-a-record-low-price-for-prime-day-162613702.html?src=rss",

Hwang shared that his original plan for the Netflix series was far more hopeful. \"I was witnessing more and more what was happening around the world,\" he said, and ultimately decided that Gi-hun's sacrifice should carry a heavier meaning. Read also: How to Watch Squid Game Season 3 on Netflix Some felt the final twist betrayed Gi-hun's character arc, especially after he spent two seasons suffering immense trauma and appearing to prioritize his family's safety. This isn't the first time a Squid Game finale has stirred controversy. When Season 1 premiered in 2021, the series became a global phenomenon almost overnight, smashing Netflix records and turning its bleak social commentary into must-watch television. Hwang emphasized that Cate Blanchett's surprise cameo as an American recruiter in the Los Angeles finale wasn't meant to set up a future spin-off, but rather to underline a broader thematic point. That translates to 368.4 million hours watched over the same 72-hour span. 1 in all 93 countries that report Netflix Top 10 metrics, which is an unprecedented feat."

Flow is Google's new filmmaking-focused AI tool, available for those paying Pro and Ultra subscribers. You also agree to Google's prohibited use policy, which outlaws the creation of abusive or illegal content. To give Veo a challenge, I wanted overlapping sound in this beach bonfire party scene. Veo 3 has the longest generation time of any AI video generator I've tested. The worst part of Veo 3 is how quickly I hit my daily generation limit. After only five videos, I was barred for an entire 24-hour period -- something that really annoyed me and made it much harder to assess. The limits are another sign that this isn't a tool meant for professional creation and iterative editing. Veo 3 isn't the revolutionary upgrade those social media posts might lead you to believe."

    "summary": "An AI-powered browser from the ChatGPT maker will inevitably compete with Google Chrome.",
    "full_text": "OpenAI is working on an AI-powered web browser that could debut in the coming weeks, Reuters reported on Wednesday. Google Chrome is the world's most popular web browser, with a global market share of 68%, according to Statista. Gen AI technology has been reshaping people's experience of the web over the last two years. An OpenAI web browser would likely accelerate that process while also giving OpenAI more direct access to user data. (Disclosure: Ziff Davis, CNET's parent company, in April filed a lawsuit against OpenAI, alleging it infringed Ziff Davis copyrights in training and operating its AI systems.) When asked for comment, Google pointed to a post on X by Chrome's vice president and general manager, Parisa Tabriz, hinting of a new upcoming browser built on Google's open source Chromium project. Any company can build a web browser based on Chromium, helping interoperability and extension support across the internet. Chrome gives Google insight into user behavior across the web, which helps the company better understand user preferences to then sell advertising. The US Department of Justice is advocating for a forced sale of Chrome after a judge ruled last August that Google was operating an illegal monopoly in the search engine market. OpenAI, Perplexity AI and Yahoo had all expressed interest in buying Chrome."

    "summary": "Amazon Prime Day is here, and it’s the perfect time to consider upgrading that old 1080p or first-gen 4K set. While it’s been nice to see TV prices fall in general over the years, there’s always room for even more discounts. And yes that includes typically high-end technology like OLED and MiniLED screens. We’ve collected the best Prime Day discounts on sets from Sony, Samsung, LG and others, along with additional deals on media streamers and soundbars. It turns out, you really don’t have to spend a ton to nab a solid home entertainment setup that supports 4K HDR and Atmos surround sound.\nBest Prime Day OLED TV deals\n\n\n\n\nLG OLED Evo C5 (65-inch) for $1,797 (down from $2,700): LG has steadily improved its C-series over the years, and the C5 Evo is its best model yet. In addition to the usual benefits of OLED, it also sports a brightness booster that can help it work well in bright rooms, as well as LG’s own “Perfect Color” technology. It doesn’t have quantum dots like Sony and Samsung’s OLEDs, but it’s also coming in significantly less than those models. The C5 Evo also has a fast 144Hz refresh rate for gaming, as well as support for NVIDIA’s G-SYNC and AMD FreeSync variable refresh rate technology. (If you’re looking for something larger, the 77-inch model has also been discounted to $2,800.)\nSony Bravia 8 II (65”) QD OLED for $2,998 (down from $3,500): Sony’s top of the line set has everything you’d want in a high-end TV, like quantum dots for improved color and brightness, as well as the inky dark blacks and infinite contrast of a modern OLED panel. You’ll always pay a bit of a premium for Sony TVs, but partially that’s due to their world-class image processing – in this case, that’s handled by Sony’s XR chip. (You can also snag the 55-inch model for $2,500.)\n\nBest Prime Day Mini LED TV deals\n\n\n\nTCL QM8K (65-inch) QD Mini LED for $998 (down from $1,800): TCL's QM8 sets feature the company's best and brightest Mini LED screens with Quantum Dots. It has an ultra-thin bezel, 144Hz refresh rate for fast gaming and one of the best contrast ratios you'll see outside of an OLED screen. Basically, it's one of the best screens you'll find that's not an OLED. While we think the 65-inch model is a great deal for most rooms, you can also step up to the 75-inch for $1,500, the 85-inch for $2,199 and the massive 98-inch set for $3,000. \nTCL QM6K (98-inch) QD Mini LED for $1,800 (down from $3,000 MSRP): The QM6K is one of the best deals we’ve seen on a 98-inch TV under $2,000, and best of all, it's not just a bargain bin screen. It has a bright Mini LED display with quantum dots for enhanced color, and it sports a fast 144Hz refresh rate for gaming. It’s also a pretty solid Prime Day deal, coming in much lower than the previous $2,200 low price. (If you don’t have the wall space for a nearly 100-inch set, the 65-inch model is similarly great and is down to $550, nearly half off its $1,000 MSRP and $100 off its lowest price. The 75-inch model is also a great deal at $850.)\nSony Bravia 5 (85-inch) Mini LED for $2,298 (down from $2,800): The Bravia 5 pairs a super bright Mini LED panel with Sony’s XR image processing chip. It won’t reach the deep dark black levels of OLED, but Mini LED achieves something close, and it can also get much brighter than OLED panels. That makes this model, as well as any Mini LED TV, an excellent option for bright rooms. (You can also scale down to the 65-inch and 75-inch Bravia 5 for $1,300 and $1,800, respectively. And there’s also the truly massive 98-inch model, which is now $1,000 off at $5,000.)\n\nBest Prime Day Frame-style TV deals\n\n\n\n\nSamsung The Frame (55-inch) for $798 (down from $1,498): This is one of the best deals we've seen on Samsung's Frame TVs, and it's a great option if you have a small living room. Frame sets don't look like typical electronics, instead their customizable bezels and glare-free screens make them look like works of art. The latest Frame sports Quantum Dots for enhanced color, a customizable bezel and offers access to 2,500 pieces of artwork in Samsung's online store.  \nSamsung The Frame Pro (65-inch) for $1,899 (down from $2,200): New for 2025, Samsung's Frame Pro sets offer brighter and higher-quality Mini LED panels for a superior TV watching experience. The 65-inch Frame Pro is a great option for most living rooms since it's large enough to deliver an immersive viewing experience, and it also comes with Samsung's wireless One Connect box for less cable clutter. While there's still no OLED Frame TV yet, this Mini LED set is the closest you'll get today. (If you're looking for something larger, the 75-inch Frame Pro is down to $2,699, and the 85-inch is $3,799.) \nHisense S7N CanvasTV (65-inch) for $898 (down from $1,300): Hisense's spin on Samsung's Frame sets, the CanvasTV, comes in much cheaper and with a boatload of features. The S7N sports an anti-glare display and art mode, as you'd expect, but there's also 144Hz support for a bit of gaming. It also comes with a slim wall mount so you can hang it on your wall like a genuine work of art. (The 55-inch model is also a great deal at $689, and the 77-inch is down to $1,399.)   \n\nBest Prime Day budget TV deals\n\nAmazon Fire TV (50-inch) for $260 (down from $400): Amazon’s budget Fire TV sets handle the basics just fine, and at this price the 50-inch model is a compelling deal as a second or third TV set. It supports HDR10 (but not Dolby Vision), and as you’d expect, it also has the Amazon Fire TV OS built-in, giving you access to over 23,000 apps. It also sports Amazon’s Alexa Voice Remote to help you find content quickly. (You can also go up and down in size, depending on your needs. The 43-inch model is now down to $220, and it’d be a solid choice for a small bedroom or office.)\nHisense QD6 (55-inch) for $240 (down from $380): Hisense is on a roll delivering tons of TV features at a very low cost, and the QD6 line is a prime example of that. It has Amazon's Fire TV and Alexa support built in, and it also supports Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos. It can even handle a bit of fast gaming with a 120Hz refresh rate.\nTCL QM6K (55-inch) for $448 (down from $600): TCL's mid-range sets finally fall below $500 for Prime Day, and that makes the QM6K one of the higher quality options in this price range. It features a bright Mini LED panel, a 144Hz refresh rate for gaming and it even includes an Onkyo speaker setup built-in. While it's technically a budget set at this price, it certainly won't look like a low-grade TV.\nRoku Smart TV (32-inch) for $100 (down from $143): Not every room needs a large TV — this Roku Smart TV is perfect for a small bedroom or office. It's powered by Roku's OS and it comes with a Voice Remote. While it only offers a 720p resolution, that will still look decently sharp on a screen this small.\n\nBest Prime Day soundbar and speaker deals\n\n\n\nSonos Beam Gen 2 for $369 (down from $499): Sonos's latest Beam is one of the best mid-range soundbars on the market. It's compact, but it also delivers expansive sound. And it also supports Dolby Atmos through a bit of speaker virtualization. The Beam is also ideal if you've already got Sonos speakers, since you can pair them all together for some household jams (or just bring your TV audio to different rooms).\nTCL S55H soundbar for $100 (down from $160): At this price, the TCL S55H delivers a ton of audio bang for the buck. It comes with a wireless subwoofer, features auto room calibration and supports virtualized surround sound like Dolby Atmos and DTS Virtual:X. With 220W of power behind its sound, the S55H should be powerful enough to fill most rooms.\nSony Bravia Theater Quad for $2,000 (down from $2,500): Leave it up to Sony to do something different in the world of home entertainment. The Bravia Theater Quad are a set of four flat modules, containing a total of sixteen speakers, which deliver truly enveloping surround sound. They’re the ideal solution for anyone who wants a theatrical experience, but doesn’t want to see gigantic tower or bookshelf speakers in their space. They support Sony’s 360 Spatial Sound Mapping, as well as Dolby Atmos and DTS:X.\nSony Bravia Theater Bar 9 for $998 (down from $1,400): The Bravia Theater Bar 9 is Sony’s most capable self-contained soundbar, with 13 speakers and support for virtualized surround sound with Dolby Atmos, DTS:X and Sony’s own 360 Spatial Sound Mapping technology. It’s the best option if you want to enjoy your favorite movies and music loud, but also don’t want to see speakers all over your living room. (The Bravia Theater 8 is also discounted to $698 and very well-equipped, with 11 speakers and the same surround sound support. )\nSony Bravia Theater System 6 for $568 (down from $770): If you want real surround sound from an actual subwoofer and satellite speakers spread around your room, the Bravia Theater System 6 is a solid choice. It pairs together a soundbar, wireless subwoofer and two rear satellites (connected by a wireless amplifier). It’s a great option for apartments and small living rooms where you just can’t live with virtualized surround sound. (You can also snag the soundbar on its own for $448, down from $650.)\n\nBest Prime Day streaming device deals\n\n\n\n\nRoku Ultra for $69 (down from $100): Roku's ultimate set-top box is the best streamer for home theater enthusiasts who want to avoid the more expensive Apple TV. It handles every video and audio format you'd want — including Dolby Vision, Atmos and HDR 10+ — and it also comes with Roku's rechargeable Voice Remote Pro. The Roku Ultra is the fastest device from the company, so you can expect to zip around Roku's interface and apps far quicker than the cheaper streaming sticks.\nRoku Streaming Stick+ for $30 (down from $40): The Roku Streaming Stick+ is the easiest way to bring Roku's robust app selection to any 4K TV. It's a great option for first-generation 4K sets that either had no streaming apps, or are way too slow by now. And it's a great gadgets to bring on trips to maintain access to all of your favorite streaming services.  \nRoku Streaming Stick HD For $20 (down from $30): The basic HD Roku Streaming stick is a solid option for bringing streaming apps to older TVs, which likely don't support 4K or any fancy HDR standards. Sure, it's as no frills as you can get, but for $20 it's worth having a backup streaming device. (or one you won't mind losing during a trip). And if you have an older TV that's still working, it's definitely worth investing a bit to get modern apps.\nAmazon Fire TV Stick 4K for $25 (down from $50): Amazon’s Fire TV Stick 4K is a simple way to add some streaming smarts to any TV with an HDMI port. Alternatively, you can load it up with your favorite streaming apps and bring it on the road – it sure beats fighting with apps built into hotel or AirBnb TVs. As a bonus, you can also play Xbox cloud streaming games when you pair a controller (Xbox GamePass membership required).     \nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/amazon-prime-day-tv-deals-for-2025-from-sony-lg-samsung-and-others-084705639.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Google Fiber announced that it has begun testing out network slicing with Nokia. Here's how this may impact your home internet service.",
    "full_text": "Google Fiber customers may see an improvement in their home internet connection very soon. Google Fiber Head of Product Nick Saporito tells CNET that “network slicing could give customers more control over how their internet performs based on what they’re doing.” Since 2023, these 5G home internet giants have begun working to establish network slicing for their services. Once established, network slicing could push the boundaries of what fiber internet has to offer. So, utilizing this technology can help allocate bandwidth and network resources. Naturally, the network congestion led to increased lag and slower speeds. Here at CNET, we consider fiber to be the gold standard of broadband. Take Google Fiber, for example: This ISP promises download and upload speeds of up to 8,000 megabits per second. Network slicing could enhance its fiber internet service in the years to come. Google Fiber’s network slicing is still in its early trial period, so it’s too early to say when home internet users will be able to take advantage of it."

    "summary": "Amazon’s own gadgets — Echo speakers, Fire tablets, Kindles and the like — are at the top of the list of tech on sale during Amazon Prime Day. While there are some (Echos, Kindles) that we like more than others (Fire tablets), there’s no question that you’ll get the best discount on all Amazon tech during Prime Day. The online retail giant typically discounts all of its in-house-made gear for Prime Day, and this year is no different. Here, we’ve collected all of the best Prime Day deals on Amazon gear so you don’t have to go searching for them.\nPrime Day Echo deals\n\n\nEcho Pop speaker for $22 (45 percent off): One of the newer Echo devices available, the Pop it sports a 1.95-inch front-facing speaker and a physical mic mute switch for extra privacy. The Pop also has built-in eero compatibility, so it can extend the area of your home Wi-Fi network if you already have an eero router system. \nEcho Buds for $45 (68 percent off): Amazon's main earbud offering, the Echo Buds are one of our top picks for the best budget wireless earbuds you can get right now. Their design allows some outside sound in, which some will prefer over total noise cancellation, and they have a comfortable design with a pocket-friendly case, automatic wear detection, multi-device connectivity and, of course, built-in Alexa voice controls.\nEcho Show 5 for $60 (33 percent off): This model is one of our favorite smart displays thanks to its compact design, ambient light sensor and sunrise alarm feature, all of which make it an excellent smart alarm clock. Amazon improved the speaker quality on this latest model, which gives sound deeper bass and clearer vocals.\nEcho Show 8 for $110 (27 percent off): This is our current top pick for the best smart display with Amazon’s Alexa thanks in part to its 8-inch touchscreen, 13MP camera that supports auto-framing for better video chats and its built-in Zigbee smart home hub. The 2023 model supports Visual ID, which will show personalized information on the device’s display depending on who’s using it, and video streaming from Netflix, Hulu, Prime Video and other services.\nPrime Day Kindle deals\n\n\nKindle Kids for $95 ($35 off): This is the same device as the base Kindle, but it becomes more kid-friendly thanks to the included cover, two-year warranty and the included year of Amazon Kids+, which gives children ages 3-12 access to hundreds of appropriate ebooks and audiobooks.

Echo Pop speaker for $22 (45 percent off): One of the newer Echo devices available, the Pop it sports a 1.95-inch front-facing speaker and a physical mic mute switch for extra privacy. Echo Buds for $45 (68 percent off): Amazon's main earbud offering, the Echo Buds are one of our top picks for the best budget wireless earbuds you can get right now. Echo Show 5 for $60 (33 percent off): This model is one of our favorite smart displays thanks to its compact design, ambient light sensor and sunrise alarm feature, all of which make it an excellent smart alarm clock. Amazon improved the speaker quality on this latest model, which gives sound deeper bass and clearer vocals. Just be sure to take note when you activate that subscription because it will renew after one year at the standard $6/month rate. Fire TV Stick 4K for $25 (50 percent off): This is the cheapest Fire TV Stick you can get to stream 4K content, plus it has support for Wi-Fi 6 and Dolby Vision and Atmos. Fire HD 8 tablet for $55 (45 percent off): This is Amazon's most bare-bones tablet, featuring an eight-inch HD touchscreen, hexa-core processor and 13 hours of battery life. Fire HD 10 Kids Pro tablet for $105 (45 percent off): This model is designed for kids aged six to 12 and comes with a slimmer protective case, a two-year warranty and one year of access to Amazon Kids+."

    "summary": "Even the most affordable Kindle usually has a $110 MSRP, so holding out for the best Prime Day Kindle deals Amazon offers makes a lot of sense. Now that day three of the four-day sale is here, nearly every Kindle Amazon sells is seeing a discount — and a few have hit the best prices we’ve seen since this year. Just note that every deal is reserved for Prime members. We’ve also noticed that in past sales, most of the Kindle deals end when the sale does (that's July 11 in this case). At Engadget, we’ve reviewed the latest Paperwhite, Colorsoft, Scribe and basic Kindle. So you can check out our reviews before you buy. Here are the best Prime Day Kindle deals.\n\n\nBest Prime Day deals on Kindle ereaders\n\n\nAmazon Kindle for $85 ($25 off with Prime): The base model Kindle is our recommendation for the best budget ereader. Even when it’s not on sale, it’s the most affordable e-book device from a major manufacturer. It’s compact and durable making it easy to carry. It doesn’t have warm LEDs and it’s not waterproof but it’s the most affordable way to access Amazon’s vast e-book ecosystem. \nKindle case (fabric) for $24 (25 percent off with Prime): If you want to protect your new ereader, you can grab this case while it's 25 percent off. Note that only the blue and pink versions are $24, the black and matcha versions are $2 more expensive. \nKindle Colorsoft for $180 ($100 off with Prime): Amazon didn’t introduce color to its ereader lineup until early this year — long after Kobo and Boox. The list price of $280 makes it more expensive than other color display ereaders, but this discount helps with that. We appreciate the fast page turns, pinch to zoom feature and auto-adjusting warm front light.\nKindle Scribe 2 for $260 ($140 off with Prime): If you want a Kindle that lets you write as well as read, this is the one to get. We gave the Kindle Scribe 2 a score of 86 in our review and it’s our pick for the best e-reader E Ink tablet. It has a smooth reading and writing experience with low latency. It also lets you create multiple notebooks, add pages and change the templates easily.\nKindle Paperwhite for $125 ($35 off with Prime): The Paperwhite is an elevated version of the Kindle, with a larger, seven-inch, flush-front screen and an adjustable warm front light. A faster processor gives it quicker page turns than its predecessor and the device itself is waterproof.\nKindle Paperwhite Signature Edition for $150 ($50 off with Prime): The Signature Edition adds few more premium features to the Kindle Paperwhite with wireless charging, an auto-adjusting front light and more storage (32GB). We gave it an 85 in our review praising the premium build, remarkably clear text and fast page turns. We just wish the power button wasn’t on the bottom.\nKindle Kids for $95 ($35 off with Prime): The Kindle Kids edition is the same hardware as the standard Kindle, but you get a few added perks that are fitting for younger users. To start, a case comes standard. The warranty is extended to two years. And the purchase price includes a six month subscription to Amazon Kids+ for thousands of kid-friendly ebooks and more.\nKindle Paperwhite Kids for $130 ($50 off with Prime): Again, the kids version is the same as the Paperwhite but with a cover, extended warranty and access to Amazon Kids+ for six months. Just remember to cancel at the end of the trial or keep it and pay $6 per month.\nBest Prime Day deals on non-Kindle ereaders\nBoox Palma 2 for $270 ($30 off): This smartphone-shaped device is a delight. It’s built on Android and can run just about any app you can download from the Play Store — just don’t expect it to play video or graphics-intensive games. This is an E Ink screen, after all. But it’s perfect for reading books and running simple apps in a more eye-friendly format.\nKobo Libra Color for $210 ($40 off): Our favorite ereader with buttons has a premium, waterproof build that’s very comfortable to hold. The touch controls and buttons are responsive and deeply customizable. The color display brings more life to book covers and graphic novels, and it’s even stylus-enabled if you want to scribble on your books. This is the lowest price in a few months, but note that it dropped to $200 in January.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/amazon-prime-day-deals-on-kindles-and-ereaders-are-still-up-to-36-percent-off-080957840.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Amazon Prime Day is in its third day, so now’s the time to stock up on discounted home essentials, clothing, shoes, and of course, tech. It’s safe to say that Amazon’s website will be overwhelming for the entirety of the event, so we wouldn’t blame you if you got distracted immediately upon opening it.\nBut if you’ve got gadgets on your wishlist, Engadget has you covered. We’re surfacing the best Prime Day deals for day three on gadgets and gear we can find right here. As in years past, Prime Day has brought solid discounts on some of our favorite tech including earbuds, tablets, robot vacuums and home devices. These are the best Prime Day deals you can get right now. We’ll be updating this post regularly throughout the duration of Prime Day, so check back to see the latest discounts. \nPrime Day deals: Engadget's top picks\nApple AirPods Pro 2 for $149 (40 percent off): The AirPods Pro 2 remain Apple’s best set of wireless earbuds, as they offer the full set of Apple-focused features, strong ANC, onboard volume controls, a comfy in-ear design and a warm sound profile that most should find agreeable. They can even work as a hearing aid now.\nSamsung 55-inch The Frame QLED 4K smart TV for $798 (47 percent off): This is the set that spurred all of the art TV copycats, and it's been a favorite of our staff for a long time. Samsung's set looks like a piece of art hanging on your wall when you're not watching TV, and you can cycle through thousands of images to show on the TV so you'll always have something new to display.\nJisulife Life7 handheld fan for $23 (21 percent off): Jisulife makes handheld fans we've recommended in past gift guides and this is one of its newer models. It can be held, folded so it sits flat on a table or worn around your neck for a cool breeze wherever you're going. It has an easy-to-read display in its center that will show you the fan speed level or current battery life, and its 5,000 mAh battery can last up to 19.5 hours on a single charge when you're running the fan on its lowest setting.\nLeebein Electric Spin Scrubber for $38 (46 percent off): This was my favorite thing I bought last year because it makes the must-detested chore of cleaning my shower less of a pain. It's an electric spin scrubber that comes with multiple cleaning heads so you can use it on your countertops, sinks, tubs and showers and more. It also has an adjustable arm so you can reach tough spots in hard-to-reach places, and it convenient recharges via USB-C.\nSamsung SmartTag 2 for $15.50 (48 percent off): Samsung users looking to keep track of their stuff need look no further than the SmartTag 2. One of our top picks for the best Bluetooth trackers, this accessory easily attaches to keys, bags and other items and uses Samsung's large finding network to show you their last known location.\nSony WH-1000XM5 headphones for $248 (38 percent off): While the XM6 headphones are the latest and greatest, they only make small changes to the already stellar XM5. These were our top pick for the best wireless headphones for a long time before the XM6 launched earlier this year, and we still like them for their excellent sound quality, strong ANC, multi-device connectivity and good battery life. Note that the black model is the only one down to $248 at the moment; all other colors are on sale for $298.\nNintendo Switch 2 + Mario Kart World bundle for $500: We'd be remiss if we didn't mention the fact that Amazon has the Nintendo Switch 2 available to order \"by invitation\" now. The Mario Kart World bundle is listed at the standard $500 price, so it's not a Prime Day deal per se, but considering Amazon was (supposedly) shut out of the initial Switch 2 order process earlier this year, it's notable to see the console listed on the site at all.\nPrime Day deals under $50\n\n\nSoundcore Select 4 for $19 (46 percent off): This 9.3-ounce speaker is a massive improvement over built-in smartphone audio. It can fill a room at a decent range of frequencies, and works well in room-sized outdoor spaces — plus, with IP67 waterproofing, it can survive a dip in the pool. It's currently almost half off.\nAnker iPhone Nano Power Bank with Built-in USB-C Connector for $20 ($10 off): One of these little guys could represent the difference between a dead phone and a not-dead phone. It’s the size of an oldey-timey lipstick case and delivers a partial charge to any USB-C phone. We tested it out and awarded it a spot in our guide to power banks.\nAmazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max for $35 ($25 off): This stick handles Dolby Vision, Dolby Atmos, 4K video and HDR10+ and supports Wi-Fi 6E. It has the fastest processor of any Fire TV Stick and Engadget’s Jeff Dunn has gotten a lot of use from the stick as a retro gaming emulator. Of course, Amazon’s user interface is less elegant (and less democratic) than others. And it highly prioritizes Prime Video content.\nAmazon Echo Spot for $45 (44 percent off): Amazon revived the Spot smart alarm clock last year, which features a half-circle shaped display that shows the time, weather and other information like song titles when you're using the speaker to play music. It has a compact design that will make it easy to fit on a desk or a nightstand, and as with any Alexa smart speaker, you can use it to control IoT devices like smart lights, locks and more.\nPrime Day Apple deals\n\n\nApple Watch Series 10 for $280 ($120 off): We consider Apple’s flagship wearable to be the best smartwatch you can buy, period. It's a mostly iterative update, with faster charging, a slightly slimmer design and a marginally larger display than the prior Series 9. That said, it's still a comprehensive fitness tracker, and no other smartwatch can integrate as neatly with iPhones and other Apple devices.\nApple iPad Air (11-inch, M3) for $479 ($120 off): In our opinion, the iPad Air is the best iPad for most people as it strikes an ideal balance between performance, price and features. The M3 chip is almost overkill for a tablet, but it means performance should never be an issue. And upcoming productivity gains from iPadOS 26 should make the tablet even more powerful.\nApple iPad (A16) for $280 (20 percent off): The latest base model iPad comes with a faster A16 chip, 2GB more RAM and 128GB of storage as standard. It earned a score of 84 in our review — if you only need an iPad for roaming the internet, watching shows and doing some lighter productivity tasks, it's a good starter tablet.\nPrime Day audio deals\n\n\nSony WH-CH720N headphones for $78 (48 percent off): The cheapest Sony headphones we'd recommend that are no slouch. They're lightweight and comfy with respectable sound for the price. You also get Adaptive Sound Control, 360 Reality Audio and multipoint Bluetooth on this budget model.\nSonos Beam Gen 2 for $369 (26 percent off): The second-gen Beam soundbar has support for Dolby Atmos and it has a relatively streamlined design that should be easy to fit into most home entertainment setups.\nBeats Pill for $99 (34 percent off): The Beats Pill is one of the few portable bluetooth speakers we liked enough to give it a full review. Those of you who love the classic Beats bluetooth speakers will be happy to know they're back in fine form. Nobody can beat the Pill for bass, and its sound is crisp and lossless at almost any frequency and volume. For some reason, only the Kim Kardashian branded version is on sale, but it's the exact same speaker.\nPrime Day laptop deals\n\n\nMicrosoft Surface Laptop (13.8-inch, Snapdragon X Plus) for $860 (28 percent off): In addition to running on a Snapdragon X Plus processor, this 2024 Surface Laptop has 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD. It's a Copilot+ PC that also has a 13.8-inch touchscreen, and it should last up to 20 hours on a single charge.\nGoogle Pixelbook Go (13-inch, Intel Core M3) for $319 (51 percent off): The Pixelbook Go is a bit old at this point, but if you're a Chrome OS lover and want a Google-made laptop, this is a solid option. It includes an Intel Core M3 processor, 8GB of RAM, 64GB of storage and a 12-hour battery life.\nPrime Day tech deals\n\n\nInstant Pot Duo Plus 9-in-1 multicooker for $70 (50 percent off): This six-quart pressure cooker and multicooker is a versatile kitchen tool for anyone who (somehow) didn't buy into the Instant Pot craze a few years back. It can do a lot with its nine cooking modes, including pressure cook, slow cook, steam, rice cook, saute and more, and the six-quart size is great for families and meal-preppers.\nRing Doorbell Battery + Indoor Cam 2 for $70 (50 percent off): If you're looking to build out a security system in your home, this bundle is a good place to start, giving you a video doorbell and an indoor security camera. You'll be able to see both live feeds in the Ring app, and they can send you motion alerts and let you speak to people on the other end of the camera when you're not at home.\nKindle for $85 ($25 off): Our favorite budget option in our guide to the best ereaders, the latest base Kindle has 16GB of storage — more than enough to hold hundreds of books at a time. It has a compact and durable design that’s easy to take anywhere, and the latest model is faster than before with speedy page turns and a more seamless navigation between books, your library and other parts of the UI.\nNinja Dual-Zone air fryer (10 quart) for $180 ($70 off): This model is one of our favorite air fryers thanks to its dual-zone cooking system, which allows you to prepare two separate foods at different temperatures and settings. There's even a Match Cook feature that ensures both foods will be done at the same time, regardless of their cooking settings.\nLevoit Core 400S air purifier for $183 ($37 off): Our top pick for the best air purifier, Levoit's Core 400S reliably improved air quality in our testing, plus it has easy to use onboard controls and replaceable filters that are not too expensive. We also found it to not be offensively loud, even on its highest setting.\nTP-Link Deco XE75 Wi-Fi 6E mesh system for $200 (20 percent off): Our top pick for the best mesh Wi-Fi system, this Deco XE75 three-pack is easy to set up and provides excellent performance with no-frills. The Deco mobile app lets you check speeds for each node, and you can see all of the devices on your network at any time.\niRobot Roomba 104 Combo robot vacuum and mop for $250 (44 percent off): This combo machine will vacuum and mop on its own, plus it comes with an auto-empty base as well. That means it will automatically empty the dry debris it collects into the base after every cleaning job.\nKindle Scribe for $260 ($140 off): The Scribe is one of the best E-Ink tablets you can buy at the moment, and certainly the top pick if you want a writable table that also excels as an ereader. It provides a great reading and writing experience, thanks in part to its ability to access the entire Kindle ebook library, and it has handy Google Drive, Microsoft OneDrive and Dropbox integration.\nDyson V15 Detect Plus for $570 ($180 off): You can't get much better than a Dyson if you're on the market for a cordless stick vacuum, and the V15 Detect delivers. It's our current top pick for the best cordless vacuum overall thanks to its excellent suction power, lightweight design, good battery life and the included Fluffy Optic cleaning head that uses a laser to show you where all the debris is while you're using it.\nHisense S7N CanvasTV (65-inch) for $898 (31 percent off): Hisense's spin on Samsung's Frame sets, the CanvasTV, comes in much cheaper and with a boatload of features. The S7N sports an anti-glare display and art mode, as you'd expect, but there's also 144Hz support for a bit of gaming. It also comes with a slim wall mount so you can hang it on your wall like a genuine work of art. (The 55-inch model is also a great deal at $689, and the 77-inch is down to $1,399.)\nWhat is Prime Day?\nPrime Day is Amazon's members-only shopping event, which means you’ll have to be a Prime subscriber on Prime Day to take advantage of most of the savings. Amazon still offers a 30-day free trial to new Prime subscribers, so you can start your free trial closer to July and participate in the event.\nWhen is Prime Day 2025?\nAmazon Prime Day 2025 will be back this year on July 8 through July 11.\nHow often is Prime Day?\nAmazon Prime Day typically comes around annually in July. In the last few years, Amazon has also had its \"Big Deal Days\" in October, which is effectively a second Prime Day and the unofficial kickoff to the holiday shopping season.\nHow does Prime Day work?\nPrime subscribers can go to Amazon's site on Prime Day to see all of the exclusive deals they have access to. Prime subscribers do not have to do anything additional to get Prime Day sales: the discounts you see on product pages will show up in your cart automatically. If you're not a Prime subscriber and you go to Amazon to shop on Prime Day, you'll likely see tons of items on sale but only \"with Prime;\" those discounts will not be available to those who are not active Prime subscribers.\nIs Prime Day only for Prime members?\nTechnically yes, but even if you do not pay for a Prime membership, you should still check out Amazon on Prime Day. While most Prime Day deals will be exclusively available to subscribers, there are always a handful of sales available to all shoppers. Amazon distinguishes between them very clearly: you'll see \"Prime exclusive\" on product pages near the deal pricing on the discounts that are only available to paying members.\nSeparately, it’s very likely that other retailers like Walmart, Target and Best Buy will have their own competing Prime Day sales during that time frame, too. So if you're not keen on shopping at Amazon at all, it's worth checking out other retailers during the week of Prime Day to see if they are matching Prime Day deal prices.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-amazon-prime-day-deals-for-day-three-our-top-picks-on-headphones-tvs-robot-vacuums-and-more-are-up-to-51-percent-off-120028023.html?src=rss",

    "full_text": "While Samsung has been showing off mobile display concepts with three screens at trade events like CES for several years, it looks like it's finally bringing one to market. As the product nears completion, we are planning to make a final decision soon.\" Samsung didn't immediately respond to a request for further comment. An animated image from a software build of One UI 8 appears to show what some are dubbing a \"Galaxy G Fold\" device with three display panels, as reported by Android Authority earlier this month. The screens would be capable of displaying different information or working in unison as one large display. Some websites have gone into overdrive trying to uncover details on what its new device might include and how much it may cost. Phone Arena reported that according to a Korean media report, it could be priced at around $3,000. Chinese phone maker Huawei released a trifolding phone in February, the Mate XT Ultimate Design, for 19,999 yuan (roughly $2,787 at time of initial publication). \"The rumors are indeed pretty strong for a couple of reasons,\" says Vikas Sharma, a senior director of patent services at Quandary Peak Research. A $3,000 price point would likely keep the phone as a niche product, at least until it drops below $2,000, Sharma says."

    "full_text": "Year-over-year, the Elon Musk-owned social network has seen its daily active user base decline by roughly 10% as of the second quarter of 2025, according to new data provided by app intelligence firm Sensor Tower. On mobile devices, there’s already some indication that Threads is catching up. New data from market intelligence provider Similarweb released this week indicates Threads is nearing X’s daily app users on mobile. Overall, X is still larger than Threads thanks to its more prominent web presence. X also has other advantages, which could make for an interesting fight between the tech giants. But Threads can’t be counted out yet, simply because X is larger. Though Threads may have fewer daily active users than X, it’s been seeing stronger growth. Advertising is not a zero-sum game, but the duopoly of Meta and Google has been hard to topple. For years, it didn’t look like that would be the case. The company’s only successful new apps were those it acquired, like Instagram and WhatsApp."

    "summary": "Amazon Prime Day is a great time to pick up gear and upgrades you wouldn't normally think about. In case you've never used a solid-state drive (SSD) before, it's a class of add-ons that bolster a device's built-in storage. Not only will your phone, laptop or console be able to hold more data, but more of those files will be quickly accessible, which can vastly improve your speeds. If you have used an SSD before, you know what you're looking for — the best discounted drives on Amazon. We've curated a list below for your Prime Day shopping.\nBest Prime Day SSD deals\n\n\n\nCrucial BX500 for $57 ($38 off): The Crucial BX500 SSD is compatible with any computer that uses a 2.5-inch SATA drive — which is still plenty of them. For very cheap, you can get ahold of 1TB storage space and read speeds up to 540 MB/s, close to the very best possible for a SATA SSD.\nWD_BLACK SN850X for $150 (25 percent off): Our current favorite Gen4 NVMe drive is on sale for Prime Day, making a read speed of over 7,000 MB/s more accessible than ever. In our tests, we found the 1TB SN850X significantly boosted our Windows operating speeds without adding much heat.\nWD Blue SN5000 for $210 ($90 off): Here's a great deal on an internal SSD with 4TB capacity and compatibility with the fast-performing NVMe protocol. Western Digital, the same brand behind the WD_BLACK (see above) claims the Blue model can hit read speeds of 5,500 MB/s.\nLexar 1TB NM790 for $67 (29 percent off): The NM790 is a single-sided SSD that can post sequential read speeds of 7400 MB/s. The one-sided design means it stays cooler for longer, and this 1TB deal includes a heatsink. It's a great budget alternative to the also single-sided Samsung 990 Pro (see below).\nSabrent Rocket 2230 for $150 (15 percent off): The Sabrent Rocket 2230 is a thumbnail-sized NVMe card that we found to be perfect for the M.2 slot on a Steam Deck. Thanks to this deal, you can save a lot by buying a lower-end Steam Deck and upgrading it with one of these.\nSamsung Fit Plus for $23 ($12 off): The Fit Plus is our favorite thumb drive, and it's not close. Running on USB 3.1 with transfer speeds between 300 and 400 MB/s, it even comes with a keychain hook. The current deal takes 34 percent off an already cheap product.\nSamsung 870 EVO for $76 (24 percent off): The 870 EVO is a great budget choice for general users, who are likely to get a speed boost on any PC activity once it's installed. At 560 MB/s of maximum reading speed, it's not for hardcore gamers, but everyday users should see real benefits.\nSamsung 990 Pro for $150 (29 percent off): The whole Samsung Pro line of SSDs is excellent for gamers, with PS5s in particular seeming to run much faster with one installed. The 990 Pro can reach read speeds of up to 1,400 KB/s — and yes, that's kilobytes, not megabytes.\nSamsung 9100 Pro for $220 ($100 off): Samsung's first NVMe SSD dropped earlier this year, and currently, they're still a bit faster than most people can use. However, if you want to get a jump on the next console generation with 14,800 MB/s sequential reading speed, this deal is your opportunity.\nKingston Fury Renegade for $420 ($210 off): Although it sounds like a Jamaican kung fu movie we'd watch the hell out of, the Kingston Fury Renegade is actually a 5th-gen NVMe SSD that can reach hardcore read speeds of up to 14,800 MB/s. It's expensive, but Prime Day discounts knock off 33 percent.\nCorsair MP600 Pro LPX 2 TB for $160 (20 percent off): Earlier this year, we named the Corsair MP600 Pro LPX as the top SSD for PS5, partly due to its affordability. It's even more affordable now — and the low price even includes a heatsink.\nAcer FA100 1TB for $51 (15 percent off): The Acer FA100 isn't the fastest SSD, but it is at least competitive, and may be one of the cheapest ways to harness the considerable power of NVMe 3.0. Only the 1TB version is marked down for Prime Day.\n\nBest Prime Day portable SSD deals\n\nSamsung T7 for $114 ($74 off): The T7 spent a long time as our reigning champion portable SSD, and it's still an amazing deal — being technically outdated means record-low prices on hardware that's more than fast enough for a Steam Deck or Switch.\nSamsung T9 for $170 ($130 off): We once named the Samsung T7 as our favorite portable SSD, but the T9 handily outdoes it, nearly doubling data transfer speeds. It's marked down 43 percent from now until the end of Prime Day on the 11th.\nSanDisk 1TB Extreme for $78 ($52 off): SanDisk designed the Extreme for portability, and it shows — this is an almost indestructible SSD you can keep in just about any bag or pocket. It's also reasonably fast, though it only works with USB-C\nCrucial X9 Pro 1TB for $75 (17 percent off): As a Gen 2 USB drive, the Crucial X9 Pro loses out to some newer competitors on speed — but it's much cheaper, and far more compatible with everyday personal computers. The 1TB model is on sale at 17 percent off its normal price.\nCrucial X9 Pro 2TB for $120 ($60 off): The Crucial X9 Pro with 2TB storage space is marked down 33 percent for Prime Day.\nCrucial X10 1TB for $82 (24 percent off): The Crucial X10 is a portable SSD for power users, only working at full strength on devices that support the latest version of USB 3.2. If that's what your build needs, you're not likely to see it much cheaper than this.\nCrucial X10 2TB for $135 (18 percent off): A 2TB version of the X10 is almost 20 percent off right now.\nCrucial X10 Pro 2TB for $150 (28 percent off): The Crucial X10 Pro is perfect for a fairly small range of users. If your PC build currently works with USB 3.2 Gen 2x2 but isn't yet handling USB4 or Thunderbolt, you won't find a faster portable SSD for your needs.\nKingston XS1000 for $80 (15 percent off): We named the Kingston XS1000 the second-best portable SSD in our current roundup, so it's great to see it going for 15 percent off today. It's almost as fast as the Crucial X9 Pro, just not quite as tough.\nADATA SE920 for $142 (5 percent off): The piddly 5 percent off is disappointing, but there's nothing disappointing about the ADATA SE920 itself. This is the ideal model for anyone regularly making huge downloads. The SE920's maximum read speed of 3,800 MB/s would be impressive for a full-size SSD, but it's fully portable, weighing less than half a pound.\nGarmese 1TB Portable SSD for $64 (20 percent off): This portable SSD uses USB3.2 to achieve read speeds of around 1000 MB/s, which is very impressive for a device not much larger than a flash drive. While it downloads fast, it's not fantastic for transferring multiple files at a time.\n\nBest Prime Day microSD card deals\n\nLexar Professional Silver Plus for $38 ($35 off): Our tests showed this to be the fastest microSD card on the market, beating out the whole Samsung line. Not only is it fast enough to download and upload 4K files without trying your patience, it's also waterproof, cheap and squeezes in both USB-A and USB-C ports.\nLexar E-Series for $31 (15 percent off): While the Silver Plus beats it out, the Lexar E-Series remains more than fast enough for 4K video, and is sufficiently rugged to fit in your adventure camera. This deal includes a five-pack of microSD cards, working out to about six dollars per 64GB of storage.\nSamsung Pro Plus for $17 ($9 off): The Samsung Pro Plus is a great microSD card for most needs, so if it's cheaper than the Lexar option, go for it. We've found that it's particularly good in handheld game systems. Just make sure to get the version rated for 180 MB/s, nothing less (it should say on the package).\nSanDisk Ultra 256GB microSDXC for $17 (15 percent off): If you're still rocking the Switch 1 (thanks, Target) and want a cheap storage expander, this deal on a SanDisk 256GB microSD card is for you. It's going for $17 right now, far less than most of the games you're likely to store on it.\nSamsung Evo Select for $22 (27 percent off): This one's by far the best option if you're after a cheap microSD card — we've seen it on sale for less than $25 more than once. It's a bit too slow for cameras, but fine for any kind of undemanding passive storage.\n\nBest Prime Day external hard drive deals\n\nSeagate Portable for $65 (19 percent off): All the Seagate hard drives we've used are refreshingly good at combining thin, light hardware with consistent speeds, and the Portable is no exception. At 4TB, this is a great deal on an external HDD with no tradeoffs.\nSeagate Game Drive for $76 (16 percent off): Seagate's Game Drive is a prime choice for adding extra space to a PS5 or Xbox Series X. Formerly overpriced, it's now dropped down to $90 for 2 TB, and that's before Prime Day makes it even cheaper.\nWD My Passport for $152 (18 percent off): The Western Digital My Passport line is ancient by computer hardware standards, but it's been updated as far as USB 3.0 and 3.1, and remains one of the cheaper options for a 6 TB hard drive. This version includes automatic backup software.\nWD Elements for $149 (15 percent off): The Elements HDD from Western Digital has gotten consistently positive feedback from our staff over the years, and as an older model, it's now wildly cheap for 6 TB of storage. It's compatible with both PC and Mac out of the box.\nWD_BLACK P10 Game Drive for $155 (18 percent off): We're big fans of the WD_BLACK SSD, and the gaming-focused external P10 is a worthy companion. It comes with 6 TB of storage for your PC, PS5, or Xbox gaming library.\nUnionSine 50\n0GB External Hard Drive for $27 (19 percent off): UnionSine's HDD is fast and USB3 compatible. Despite how thin and light it is, we've found it remarkably hard to damage. 500GB may be a bit tight with the size of files these days, but at this price, you could just buy two of them.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/amazon-prime-day-deals-on-ssds-and-external-hard-drives-are-still-available-save-on-samsung-crucial-sandisk-and-more-090355949.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "For the first time ever, the July Amazon Prime Day sale is running for four straight days, so you've still got a chance to at enjoying sharp discounts on some of the best speakers money can buy. Whether you're after a bluetooth speaker you can take on an adventure, a soundbar to anchor your home theater or a smart speaker that'll save time around the house, there's a high chance something just dropped into your price range. Our audiophiles have combed through the sales and put together a list of discounted speakers that stand out from the herd, including top brands like JBL, Bose, Sonos, Beats and Ultimate Ears. So whether you're sick of missing dialogue in your shows, or you want music at near-live quality for your pool party, the list below is for you.\nBest Prime Day Bluetooth speaker deals\nOur portable bluetooth speaker picks are some of the best all-around mobile music devices to ever hit the shelves: smaller and lighter than a boombox, better audio than an iPod, and way easier in the long run than learning to play guitar. We've sifted through Prime Day offerings to find the best portable speakers in all shapes and sizes. \n\n\n\nTribit Stormbox Micro 2 for $56 (20 percent off): This tiny portable speaker packs a wallop — you won't believe how high you can crank the volume on such a small, light device. Weighing in at about one pound, it includes a rubber strap for attaching it to your backpack or bike, and comes with a USB charging port.\nBeats Pill for $98 (35 percent off): The Beats Pill is one of the few portable bluetooth speakers we liked enough to give it a full review. Those of you who love the classic Beats bluetooth speakers will be happy to know they're back in fine form. Nobody can beat the Pill for bass, and its sound is crisp and lossless at almost any frequency and volume. For some reason, only the Kim Kardashian branded version is on sale, but it's the exact same speaker.\nSoundcore Motion 300 for $53 (34 percent off): The Motion 300 is that rare portable speaker that outperforms at both high and low frequencies. Its upper range goes into 40 kHz, while its bass can deliver bone-shaking thumps even outdoors. All that in 1.7 pounds with 13 hours of battery life — and it's even partially waterproof.\nAnker Soundcore Motion+ for $75 (24 percent off): Tough, sturdy construction makes this speaker an excellent choice for home bluetooth. Its battery lasts for 12 hours in the wild, and it always sounds great, but it's a bit heavy for pedaling through the park. There's also an option for wired connections, and it even works as a backup soundbar.\nAnker Soundcore 2 for $28 (38 percent off): The Soundcore 2 is an older bluetooth speaker, but it holds up — fully waterproof, with 24 hours of battery life and bass you can hear on the other side of a pool. It's on sale for less than $30.\nSoundcore Select 4 for $19 (46 percent off): This 9.3-ounce speaker is a massive improvement over built-in smartphone audio. It can fill a room at a decent range of frequencies, and works well in room-sized outdoor spaces — plus, with IP67 waterproofing, it can survive a dip in the pool. It's currently almost half off.\nUE Everboom for $190 ($80 off): If you want something stronger than the Wonderboom but the Hyperboom isn't portable enough, the Everboom is a great middle ground. Its ideal range is a little narrow, but it makes up for that with 360-degree sound and extreme durability (i.e. so waterproof it literally floats).\nJBL Go 3 for $30 (25 percent off): The JBL Go 3 improves on its predecessor with a carabiner-friendly design, five hours of battery life, and IP67-rated waterproofing and dustproofing. It's not exactly powerful, but it's way better than a phone speaker for driving, trekking or camping.\nJBL Pulse 5 for $200 ($50 off): The Pulse 5 is JBL's latest and greatest party speaker, throwing out 360-degree light bursts that sync up to the music. There's substance behind the flash, too, with speakers designed around the bass frequencies and 12 hours of battery life.\nBose SoundLink Flex 2nd Gen for $99 (33 percent off): This mini speaker from Bose is one of our favorites on the list for hands-free phone calls. It supports both Google Assistant and Siri and runs up to 12 hours on one charge, all while being smaller than a clutch purse. It also kills as a portable music player, though the sound doesn't stretch far enough to fill a room.\nBose Soundlink Revolve+ Series II for $179 ($120 off): The Revolve series was Bose's first line of 360-degree outdoor speakers, and they're still a strong choice today. The Revolve+ weighs about two pounds and can run for 17 hours without recharging.\nBose Soundlink Max for $299 ($100 off): Bose's Soundlink Max marries a classic carrying-case design with audio that sounds like it's coming from a much bigger unit. It comes with a 20-hour battery and IP67-rated protection against the elements.\nMarshall Emberton II for $95 (47 percent off): Marshall has been making audio equipment for more than 60 years, and still has a thing or two to teach the young'ns. The Emberton II looks like a classic amp, but weighs a quarter of a pound and provides balanced sound for more than 30 hours per charge.\nMarshall Acton III for $200 ($100 off): All right, so a six-pound speaker isn't exactly portable — but if you can stand lugging it around, the Acton III can be a highly versatile device. From music to outdoor parties to pulling double duty as a soundbar, this is a low-setup, low-overhead option for nearly all audio tasks.\nOrtizan X10 for $30 (41 percent off): Ortizan is a newer brand from China, but we like what we've seen from them so far. The X10 is the size of the Beats Pill but comes at the price of a belt-clip speaker like the JBL Go 3. If you do have a problem, Ortizan's customer service is highly responsive.\n\nBest Prime Day smart speaker deals\nSmart speakers aren't just about getting a disembodied voice to do your bidding (or at least as much of your bidding as Alexa can do without hands). On top of assistant support, the picks below serve up legitimately great audio quality alongside useful extra features. The only downside is that they're often overpriced, but that's what Prime Day is for.\n\nAmazon Echo Dot for $32 (36 percent off): Amazon may not have updated the Echo Dot since 2022, but that just goes to show how well this spherical smart speaker serves as the perfect host for Alexa. Both music and speech sound clear, and it's easy to integrate with other smart home devices. Right now, it's marked down more than a third.\nAmazon Echo Pop for $22 (45 percent off): The latest Echo Pop release continues the trend of making Alexa's best features available on a mini-sized, reasonably priced device. Its half-spherical design fits on any desk or shelf, and its sound output is consistently clear — and gets louder than you might believe.\nSonos Era 100 for $179 ($20 off): Smart speakers from the Amazon Echo line play perfectly good music, but true audiophiles in need of assistant support should look to Sonos. The Era 100 has tweeters and woofers precisely arranged for clear, full-room sound, and it's easy to hook up to your other audio gear. Just be warned it only supports Alexa, not Google Assistant.\nJBL Authentics 200 for $200 ($180 off): JBL's Authentics line is modeled after a product it sold in the 70s. Its old-school bookshelf-friendly design belies its advanced feat of running Google Assistant and Alexa simultaneously (as opposed to other smart speakers where you have to pick just one).\nJBL Authentics 300 for $300 ($150 off): The JBL Authentics 300 can host both Alexa and Google Assistant at the same time, which impressed us enough that we gave it a full review. While we had some issues — namely its tendency to over-emphasize vocals — we can't quibble with its high-range performance or retro design.\n\nBest Prime Day soundbar deals\nFlatter, lighter and larger TV screens are nice for visuals, but often sacrifice sound quality to lose weight. If you've found yourself turning on the subtitles for your shows more often lately, you might need a soundbar to augment your TV's built-in speakers. We found a few of the best on sale for Prime Day — Sonos leads this space, but it's not without competitors.\n\nBose Smart for $400 (20 percent off): In our full review of the Bose Smart, we noted that two drivers in the center make its sound feel directional without any other speakers needed — simply cranking up those makes any audio more immersive. You can also link it to a pair of Ultra Open Earbuds (not included) for a private surround sound experience.\nBose Smart Ultra for $700 ($200 off): The Smart Ultra upgrades the Bose Smart with a more sophisticated calibration system which adjusts sound settings to fill whatever room it's in. If you want the Smart's personal surround experience for more than one person, the Smart Ultra is for you.\nSonos Beam for $369 (26 percent off): The Sonos Beam is a fantastic choice for a mid-budget soundbar. It's one of the most accessible Dolby Atmos systems, and uses careful audio alterations to achieve a much more immersive sound than other bars of its size.\nSonos Ray for $169 (15 percent off): If you're looking to pay a bit less, go with the Sonos Ray to maximize sound quality on a budget. The audio won't wrap around your room like it might from a more premium model, but it's still a vast improvement on nearly all built-in TV speakers.\nSony HT-S400 for $178 (41 percent off): Sony built the HT-S400 for everyone who wants a soundbar but not an entire home theater. It's a 2.1-channel system that still manages immersive surround sound and is easy to integrate with Sony TVs. Right now, it's 40 percent off, one of the best prices we've seen on any soundbar.\nSony Bravia Theater Bar 6 for $448 ($200 off): One of Sony's newest audio products, the Bravia Theater Bar 6 is a 3.1.2 soundbar that can bend audio in more directions to fill your theater space. It can handle Dolby Atmos, and has an integrated AI feature that recognizes and clarifies human voices.\nVIZIO 2.0 for $78 (22 percent off): Vizio's budget soundbar makes a worthy alternative to the Sonos Ray. It punches above its weight and gets as close as possible to Dolby Atmos surround sound as a single unit can manage. For less than $100, you'll never mishear a line of dialogue again.\nJBL Bar 9.1 for $760 ($440 off): The 9.1 is JBL's first sound bar to be compatible with Dolby Atmos, and it doesn't disappoint. Each unit comes with two wireless speakers you can move around your viewing room, and there's even a 4K passthrough input to ensure your sound system doesn't mess with image quality.\nSennheiser Ambeo Mini for $600 ($200 off): We recommend the Sennheiser Ambeo Mini for a relatively cheap premium soundbar. It excels in smaller spaces (though it needs an extra subwoofer to fill larger ones), and its connected app includes several sound presets you can use to optimize its virtual speakers.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-prime-day-speaker-deals-are-still-up-to-47-percent-off-on-jbl-bose-sonos-and-others-085948844.html?src=rss",

Amazon Echo Pop for $22 (45 percent off): The latest Echo Pop release continues the trend of making Alexa's best features available on a mini-sized, reasonably priced device. Sonos Era 100 for $179 ($20 off): Smart speakers from the Amazon Echo line play perfectly good music, but true audiophiles in need of assistant support should look to Sonos. Just be warned it only supports Alexa, not Google Assistant. Its old-school bookshelf-friendly design belies its advanced feat of running Google Assistant and Alexa simultaneously (as opposed to other smart speakers where you have to pick just one). We found a few of the best on sale for Prime Day — Sonos leads this space, but it's not without competitors."

    "summary": "If you're looking to keep an eye on your home, whether you're away for the weekend or just tucked into bed, a good security camera can give you peace of mind. The best security camera setups in 2025 do a lot more than just record footage — they offer smart alerts, crystal-clear video, night vision, two-way talk and seamless integration with other smart home gear.These days you can find security cameras for almost every need: indoor cameras to check in on pets, floodlight cams that light up your driveway or battery-powered outdoor options that can go just about anywhere. Whether you're building out a whole-home system or just want one reliable camera to start, we've rounded up the top picks that offer great performance, helpful features and easy app controls.\nTable of contents \n\nBest security cameras for 2025\nWhat to look for in a security camera\nOther security cameras we tested\nSecurity camera FAQs\n\nBest security cameras for 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat to look for in a security camera\nHardware and design\nOne of the first things you’ll want to consider before buying a home security camera is where you intend to put it. Do you want an outdoor or indoor setup, or cameras that can work in both environments? That’s the first decision to make, since not all cameras are designed to be weatherproof. Next, consider where those cameras will live: do you need ones that can easily mount to the side of your home or above your garage? Do you want cameras in every room of your house, installed up in a ceiling corner out of reach? Should those cameras be able to swivel and turn on their own to track subjects or give you a wider field of view? If you just want to see packages on your porch or who's coming to the door, a doorbell camera might be a better option.  \nCheck the specifications for the cameras you’re considering to see if they come with any mounting hardware in the box, or if you’ll need special attachments to get the capabilities you want. For example, an extra feature like solar power for outdoor security cameras typically requires buying the solar panel separately, or buying a configuration of the camera that includes the panel in the box.\nAnother hardware component to consider is the proper connection for local storage. Many home security cameras give you the option to save footage locally by connecting a thumb drive or a microSD card either to the camera itself or to its base station. If you don’t intend on using cloud storage (which typically comes with a subscription cost), choosing a surveillance camera system that allows for local storage will be key.\nBattery life\nBattery life considerations will only apply to wireless cameras, so you’ll want to make note of the expected battery life of any wire-free camera you’re considering. For most that use rechargeable lithium-ion batteries, it will come down to how “busy” the camera will be on a regular basis recording video. Some could estimate a minimum battery life of a couple weeks to one month with high usage, but you could get even more than that if the camera is in a low-traffic area.\nI personally think you should be getting at least three weeks of battery life out of any rechargeable-battery security camera — anything less and it becomes a hassle just to keep the device in working order. Also, be prepared to access your cameras (including those mounted in high places) whenever you need to recharge their batteries. Scant few options today (looking at you, Blink), run on AA or AAA batteries, and those tend to last up to two years before you need to replace them.\nAudiovisual features\nNearly every security camera can send you a notification when it detects motion. Most also offer more sophisticated alerts, like person, package, pet and vehicle detection, though those sometimes require a subscription. You can decide under which conditions you’d like to be alerted as well. Many cameras will let you set location preferences, using your phone to discern where you are, so you’re only alerted when you’re away. Some can then be programmed to turn off completely when you’re home, or you can decide to keep the camera recording without alerting you of activity. Systems without location tracking can be armed on a schedule or manually turned on and off.\nAlmost every security camera can listen as well as see — some can send you an alert when specific sounds are detected, such as breaking glass, barking dogs or fire alarms. Those microphones also let you hear what’s going on in the room, while built-in speakers allow for two-way conversations.\nIf viewing events at night is important to you, you’ll want to consider a camera’s ability to see in the dark. Most use infrared LEDs to detect motion and record events after the sun goes down. Infrared will work in total darkness, but can only produce a black and white image. A few cameras can capture color video at night through a combination of larger sensors and onboard image processing, but they won’t work in total darkness. A couple of the options we tried were spotlight cams with an onboard light you can manually turn on to light up a space for a better picture. Floodlight cameras are another option for outdoor models, which shine a bright light when motion is detected which may act as a deterrence.  \nSubscription features\nWithout exception, every camera we tested has an optional subscription component. These typically run between $3 and $15 per month, though some offer a discount if you pay for a year up front. Advanced (and sometimes basic) features are paywalled behind these subs, so if you’re looking for things like person detection, extended live feeds, cloud storage, event labeling and longer event history, you’ll want to check whether you get those for free or only if you pay up.\nCloud storage for video clips beyond a day or so is the most common subscription-only feature, but some cameras have the option of using local storage with a microSD card or flash drive. Cameras that work with Apple’s HomeKit will usually let you store clips using your iCloud+ plan, so you might not need a separate subscription for those. To help make sense of whether you need to pay for a plan or not, we detail the monthly prices and membership features for each pick below so you can gauge the full cost of the level of monitoring you want.\nPrivacy settings\nThe majority of security cameras use cloud storage for clips. Even those that store your footage locally on SD cards or USB drives are still considered Wi-Fi cameras, connecting to the world at large through your home internet. Anything that’s in communication with other networks has the potential to be accessed by bad actors. Manufacturers take measures such as encrypting video before it’s sent to the cloud and requiring two-factor authentication to sign into any account to make systems safer. Users can go one step further by regularly installing security updates and making sure the passwords they use are strong and not reused elsewhere.\nAs for keeping your personal activity private, all cameras have a disarm feature, but some can automatically turn off when you are home if you share your location. Others will also let you set privacy zones and won’t capture footage or send alerts for movements in designated areas. That could be a part of the house you don’t want recorded or, for outdoor coverage, parts of your neighbor’s yard or driveway.\nAll the units we tested have indicator lights that turn on when a live view is being accessed or recording is taking place. But you’ll have to check what your particular camera’s LEDs mean, as nearly every one is different. Recording in progress is sometimes indicated with a red light, sometimes that light is blue, and on other cameras, it’s green. Some security cameras let you disable the recording light too, if you don’t want to alert would-be intruders that you’re watching them.\nCompatibility\nIf this is your first foray into smart home gear, you just need to ensure that the camera you buy will work with your phone — and all of our top picks here have apps that work with both iOS and Android. If you already have TVs, smart monitors, home hubs, doorbells and other smart devices, check that what you buy now will work with what you already have if you want the most seamless system.\nWe’ve listed which of the three major smart home ecosystems each of our picks will work with, but in general, Amazon Alexa has the widest compatibility with third party brands, followed by Google. Apple’s HomeKit has a smaller number of compatible cameras on the market, but the list is still sizable enough and includes well-regarded brands like Ecobee, Logitech and Aqara, so you’ll likely be able to find one with the features you want.\nOther security cameras we tested\nLogitech Circle View Apple HomeKit-Enabled\nWe called out the Logitech Circle View camera as a HomeKit-enabled alternative to our top Siri pick, the Ecobee cam but it’s worth mentioning its merits once more. The Circle View works well with Apple’s smart home system and connected easily with my HomePod. Like with Ecobee, you may not need to pay for an additional subscription for cloud storage if you already have an iCloud+ plan. The video captured is warm and sharp. But it’s pricier than Ecobee’s HomeKit option and the web cam-aesthetic isn’t particularly elegant.\nRoku Indoor Security Camera\nWhile we don’t love that the Roku Indoor Security Camera uses a micro USB connection, the unit itself has a solid build. It can spin in either direction to track movement, either automatically or manually through the app. It’s easy to set up and is remarkably affordable. A subscription is required for clip storage and event filtering. Without it, the camera will only store stills from detection events, though you can easily manually save clips to your photos library from within the app. The color night vision is surprisingly clear, and the daytime recordings are bright and sharp. While other cameras we tested simply offered more features and better apps, this could be a compelling budget pick.\nAqara 2K Hub G3\nIf you ask a seven-year-old which camera is best (and we did) they will tell you it’s the Aqara 2K Hub G3, thanks to the unit’s cute little ears. We tested it with its own app, which worked well, and with HomeKit, which unfortunately kept disconnecting throughout our testing. The camera was easy and quick to set up thanks to the dual-bank Wi-Fi connection. We also appreciated the privacy setting that physically angled the camera lens down inside the unit (revealing a pair of shut-eye images that added to the adorableness). If you’re considering getting other Aqara smart home devices, and will primarily use the Aqara app, the Hub H3 is a good buy as it acts as the required hub for other devices from the brand.\nRing Indoor Cam (wired)\nThe Blink camera was simply a better value than the Ring Indoor Cam. The Ring unit felt overly lightweight and insubstantial, to the point where its own cable caused it to fall over. Set up was a little fussy and many of the available features are reserved for paid subscriptions. But the app helpfully leads you through setup and walks you through the various features, making it good for beginners. You’re also automatically opted into the Ring Neighbors app which is a fascinating glimpse into your neighborhood’s porch piracy events, lost cats, wild animal sightings and missing binky alerts.\nRing Outdoor Cam (Stick Up Cam, wireless)\nSimilarly to the Indoor Cam, the Ring Outdoor Cam was easy to set up and could be a decent option for beginners. Previously known as the Stick Up Cam, this model is wireless and rechargeable, but our biggest gripe with it is that it powers up via microUSB. USB-C is the standard now, so we recommend only buying new tech that supports the latest standard whenever possible. It’s worth noting that the new Ring Outdoor Cam Plus also charges via microUSB, so it seems Ring faithfuls may be stuck with old tech for a while longer.\nSecurity camera FAQs\nIs it better to have wired or wireless security cameras?\nWired security cameras are hardwired directly to the system’s local video storage, such as a digital video recorder (DVR) or a network video recorder (NVR) connected via Ethernet cables. That makes it more secure and not subject to the whims of Wi-Fi connections. But running the power and Ethernet cables to the camera require more intensive installation, possibly requiring a professional. Wireless cameras or plug-in cameras give you more flexibility in the installation process and location. Though a local, wired connection is less susceptible to remote hacking, most current wireless cameras implement fairly strong security measures — but you’ll still want to make sure you choose complex passwords and turn on safety measures like two-factor authentication.\nWhat do security camera subscriptions look like?\nSubscriptions for security cameras usually run between $3 and $15 per month, though you can often get a discount if you pay for a year of service up-front. They give you access to advanced (and sometimes basic) features such as person detection, cloud storage, live feeds and intelligent labelling of events.\nWhat security system does not require a monthly fee?\nExcluding cameras from home security system companies like ADT and Slomins, nearly all DIY security cameras will work on a basic level without a subscription, meaning you can usually get motion-triggered alerts and the ability to see at least a short history of recorded action. Some cameras, such as the Blink Mini, offer no cloud storage without a subscription, but you can still see a live feed and you can opt for local footage storage with additional equipment.\nHow do you install a security camera?\nInstalling a security camera can be as simple as setting it on a table, plugging it in and using the app to connect to your home’s Wi-Fi. Indoor cameras often come with user-installable wall mounts as well. Wireless outdoor security cameras are sometimes battery-operated, so you don’t need to install them near an outlet and they often come with mounting brackets for attaching them to outdoor surfaces. Larger security systems with hardwired cameras may require professional installation.\nDo security cameras record sound?\nEvery security camera we tested records sound as well as video. You can turn sound recording on or off at your leisure.\nDo security cameras work with existing surveillance systems?\nSome do. The easiest way to ensure that your camera will work with your other surveillance equipment is to get devices from the same brand.\nDo wireless security cameras work without Wi-Fi?\nMost wireless home security cameras connect via Wi-Fi. However, some cameras have the option of connecting through a cellular data plan. Of course, there’s an additional cost for such connectivity, but it allows the cameras to record if the Wi-Fi goes out or if a camera is too far from home to get a signal from the router.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/best-security-camera-130035012.html?src=rss",
    "full_text": "The company’s omnipresence may be alarming in its scope, but it certainly makes signing up for stuff easier. I was happy to find a camera that could work happily with two of the three major platforms. The Altas PT Ultra is one of Reolink’s newest battery-powered security cameras and it really shines in that department. There are also handy quick controls on the main page for each camera that let you take photos and record snippets of video to be saved immediately. Reolink (unsurprisingly) has a cloud subscription plan that you can use to save videos, but the tiers and pricing are unclear. Those microphones also let you hear what’s going on in the room, while built-in speakers allow for two-way conversations. Anything that’s in communication with other networks has the potential to be accessed by bad actors. Others will also let you set privacy zones and won’t capture footage or send alerts for movements in designated areas.

I found the difficulty curve to be rather generous, and only really got stonewalled around threat level five in my single-player matches. This fungal contagion is no joke: Every piece of electronic equipment on New Atlas has been taken over by sentient spores, which means lasers and railguns that used to protect the Saxon Corporation's assets are now wielded against you. Every foe you face is generated with a new combination of nasty tools meant to make your life harder. The enemy AI feels adaptive to evolving combat scenarios, which is impressive for a game of this scope and size. Each enemy will keep their distance from you or press the attack depending on the weapons and tools they've attached to their cores -- I find that it's worth shooting apart limbs even on destroyed enemies so they don't get repurposed as part of a larger squadron of fighters. My personal favorite is this DMR -- its pinpoint primary fire charges up a laser beam as it strikes enemies.

They are trained using real images and videos. The New York Times says that much of this new glut of AI-generated content includes real CSAM that has been repurposed by the algorithm. Some of the material even uses real photos of children scraped from school websites and social media.\nThe issue dates back to the early days of this technology. In 2023, researchers at the Stanford Internet Observatory found hundreds of examples of CSAM in a data set used in an early version of the image generator Stable Diffusion. Stability AI says it has introduced safeguards to improve safety standards and \"is deeply committed to preventing the misuse of our technology, particularly in the creation and dissemination of harmful content, including CSAM.\"\nThat did lead other companies to start reporting AI-generated CSAM to the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children. Amazon reported a whopping 380,000 instances of AI-generated CSAM in the first half of this year, all of which it took down. OpenAI reported 75,000 cases.\nNCMEC Applauds the California State Legislature for Passing AB 1831 and looks forward to it being signed into law.  NCMEC supports AB 1831 because it addresses gaps in California’s legal remedies for child victims of Generative AI CSAM. We are heartened to see states move… pic.twitter.com/qZt1mgD7Eo— National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (@NCMEC) September 4, 2024\n\nCourts have been slow to catch up with this tech. The DOJ made its first known arrest last year of a man suspected of possessing and distributing AI-generated CSAM. A UK man recently got 18 months in jail for using AI to generate the foul images, which he sold.\n“The Department of Justice views all forms of AI-generated CSAM as a serious and emerging threat,” Matt Galeotti, head of the Justice Department’s criminal division, told NYT.\nIt's worth noting that despite the alarming uptick in occurrences, AI-generated content still represents a mere fraction of all CSAM identified by authorities and watchdog organizations. For instance, the Internet Watch Foundation confirmed 291,273 reports of CSAM in 2024 and, as previously noted, just two instances were AI-generated.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/reports-indicate-a-massive-uptick-in-ai-generated-csam-throughout-the-internet-154937671.html?src=rss",

But what's not mentioned in the post or the video is that YouTube has been battling a problem with AI-generated videos, particularly \"AI slop\" that is of low value to users but that is inundating social media networks and platforms such as YouTube. The problem has gotten so bad that John Oliver recently devoted an entire episode of his HBO show to the rise of AI slop. (You can find it, incidentally, on YouTube.)

    "summary": "Amazon's Prime Day is in full swing, and now that two full days have passed, some of us have gotten past our decision paralysis and checked out our online shopping carts. It's no surprise that the Engadget team consists of people who are fans of tech (and non-tech) products, and we also love a good deal. As we've put together roundups and news stories about the best things to buy this week, we've also been tempted by the savings. Here's a list of what several of our team members bought, not only to share our lives with you but to also show you some of the deals we deemed good enough to spend our own money on. \n\n\n(Ed. note: Igor Bonifacic saved a whopping $2 on this guitar tuner, but it was worth it to him. I'll let him explain.) \nIn Canada, the D'Addario tuner I ended up buying is normally a little more expensive at $20 CAD, but I figured there was a chance it would go on sale for Prime Day. So I set up a Camelcamelcamel alert, and on the morning of July 8 I got an email from the website saying it was… $2 off. Not the greatest discount, but hey, in such an expensive hobby, every dollar counts, right?\nThis past spring, I picked up the guitar for the first time in about 15 years. How it happened doesn't matter. What does matter is that now I play everyday, and I've been asking myself why did I ever stop in the first place. I feel more creative, my eyes feel healthier from less screen time and I'm better now than I ever was as a teenager.\nAs I've gotten back into the hobby, I've slowly been buying all the little accessories that can make it easier to maintain your guitar. With Prime Day around the corner, I set my sights on a headstock tuner. These little gadgets weren't around when I first started learning the instrument, but let me tell you they're great.\nLike the name suggests, you attach one to the headstock of your guitar. It then allows you to tune the instrument by measuring the vibrations produced by the strings. While you could just as easily use an app like GuitarTuna to do the same, clip-on tuners aren't affected by ambient noise, making the entire tuning process fast and easy. Best of all, they're cheap. In the US, you can spend as little as $15 to buy the model I purchased for Prime Day. — Igor Bonifacic, senior reporter\n\n\nWithout even trying, I've become a devotee of Apple's Continuity Camera over the last few years. I think with my laptop and monitor setup, it's just always made more sense to use my iPhone as a camera rather than buying some kind of USB-C docking station or giving up another port on my computer. Unfortunately, I also find having my phone within arm's reach while I'm writing to be pretty distracting. Taking advantage of a Prime Day deal on a dedicated webcam this year is my solution.\nI purchased an off-white Logitech Brio 500, which normally costs $130, but is $50 off for Prime Day through Amazon or Logitech. It's a kind of a long, tube-shaped 1080p webcam, so not the sleekest or best option out there, but it has the basics I need, like a manual shutter and auto-framing, and critically, it matches my Logitech mouse. If, like me, you can't stand the idea of paying over $100 for a webcam, I think it's a pretty appealing option at $80. — Ian Carlos Campbell, contributing writer\n\n\n\nI recently discovered that as all my gear transitioned to USB-C, I no longer had any compatible thumb drives. Rather than buy an adapter dongle that I would inevitably lose, I figured it would be smart to have a new thumb drive that could handle both USB-C and USB-3. The discount on the SanDisk drive I bought wasn't huge, but Prime Day seemed like a good time to save a few bucks on a practical purchase. — Anna Washenko, contributing reporter\n\n\nI made a very short, focused list of three things to buy on Prime Day — a Nori Press, a walking pad and the Ms. Rachel Tonie toy for the kids in my life. But when I was looking through our roundup of the best deals this week, the discounted entry-level iPad caught my eye. \nMy dad had been asking me repeatedly for weeks about an iPad for watching videos and movies while him and my mom were traveling, and I wasn't able to give them an answer as I was weighing a lot of concerns. What is the best operating system for them? Do they need something released recently, or could they save some money on an older model? \nSeeing this current-generation iPad on sale prompted me to just buy it for them. It simplifies things as my dad uses an iPhone and is familiar with iPadOS, and apps like YouTube and Netflix would satisfy their desires to download videos to watch offline. Saving $70 on what is a very solid device felt like a great deal, but more importantly it earned me points with my family. — Cherlynn Low, managing editor\nWhat we're still considering\nAs Prime Day goes on till the end of the week, many on the Engadget team are still weighing their decisions. Executive editor John Falcone, for example, hasn't bought Anker's UFO 3-device charger, but says he wishes he did. I'll update this post if he does, because he will save almost 30 percent on it.\nNot all our purchases have been through Amazon, either. Editor-in-chief Aaron Souppouris is thinking about buying \"a weird camera for too much money not on Amazon.\" It's a full-spectrum conversion camera, and if and when he does make that purchase, we will be sure to shame him here.\nFinally, senior reporter Billy Steele has made arguably the best shopping decision all week, on or off Amazon. He bought \"three Happy Meals trying to get the cool toys. I got three of the same toy. :(\" This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/amazon-prime-day-2025-the-deals-that-the-engadget-team-spent-our-hard-earned-money-on-154509453.html?src=rss",

The Ninja Foodi Dual-Zone 10-quart air fryer is $70 off and down to $180.\nThis is not a record low price for this model. However, it’s still a good price for this time of year, some five months away from Black Friday. \n\n\nThis model is one of our favorite air fryers. In fact, it's our pick for the best dual-zone air fryer. It heats up quickly and runs quietly, but the real selling point here is the dual-basket setup.

    "summary": "If your laptop simply isn’t cutting it anymore, Amazon Prime Day might have arrived just in time. As has been the case for the past few years, laptop deals are abundant this Prime Day, bringing discounts to MacBooks, Windows laptops, Chromebooks and more. But we wouldn’t blame you if you didn’t know how to figure out if that laptop you’re eyeing actually has a good discount for Prime Day, or if the deal is stale.\nThat’s where Engadget can help. We’ve poured over the Prime Day laptop deals available this year to pick out the best ones you can get across all kinds of computers. If you’re super picky about the specs you want in a new laptop, we always recommend going straight to the manufacturer so you can configure the machine exactly to your needs. But if you’re willing to work with premade models, Prime Day deals could help you save some cash on your next laptop. \nPrime Day laptop deals: MacBooks\nApple’s latest laptops are the MacBook Air M4 and the MacBook Pro M4, but the M3-powered machines are still available and great values when you can get them at steep discounts. But for the most future-proof options, we recommend going with the M4 MacBooks. Amazon actually has decent MacBook deals throughout the year, most of the time on the base configurations of any given model. In a welcomed update, Apple recently made all base models of the MacBook Air M4 have 16GB of RAM by default (which is the same as you’ll find on the base-level Pros).\n\n\n\nMacBook Air (15-inch, M4, 16GB RAM, 256GB SSD) for $1,049 ($150 off)\nMacBook Air (15-inch, M3, 24GB RAM, 512GB SSD) for $1,299 (24 percent off)\nMacBook Pro (14-inch, M4, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD) for $1,429 (11 percent off)\n\nPrime day laptop deals: Windows laptops\nYou’ve got a lot of variety to choose from when it comes to Windows laptops, and that can be a blessing or a curse. We recommend looking for a laptop from a reputable brand (i.e. Microsoft, Dell, Acer, Lenovo and others like them), and one that can handle daily work or play pressures. That means at least 8GB of RAM and 245GB of SSD storage, plus the latest Intel or AMD CPUs. If you’re looking for a new gaming laptop, you’ll need a bit more power and a dedicated graphics card to boot. Now is a good time to consider upgrading as well since Windows 10 will be sunset in October this year and Microsoft has recommended users upgrade to newer Windows 11 laptops.\n\n\n\nSamsung Galaxy Book5 360 (Windows 11, Copilot+, 15.6-inch, Intel Core Ultra 7, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD) for $1,050 (22 percent off)\nMicrosoft Surface laptop (Windows 11, Copilot+, 13.8-inch, Snapdragon X Plus) for $880 (27 percent off)\nLenovo V15 G2 laptop (Windows 11 Pro, 15.6-inch, Intel Celeron N4500, 32GB RAM, 1TB SSD) for $429 (28 percent off)\nMicrosoft Surface Pro 2-in-1 (Windows 11, Copilot+, 13-inch, Snapdragon X Plus, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD) for $870 (28 percent off)\nDell Inspiron 3520 laptop (Windows 11, 15.6-inch, Intel Core i5, 8GB RAM, 512GB SSD) for $350 (22 percent off)\nAcer Nitro V gaming laptop (Windows 11, 15.6-inch, Intel Core i5, RTX 4050, 8GB RAM, 512GB SSD) for $650 ($150 off)\nASUS ROG Strix G16 gaming laptop (Windows 11, Intel Core i9, RTX 4060, 16GB RAM, 1TB SSD) for $1,360 ($340 off)\n\nPrime Day laptop deals: Chromebooks\nMost Chromebooks start off pretty affordable, so that just means you can get them for even less during an event like Prime Day.

The semiconductor giant is planning to launch an AI chip specifically for the Chinese market as early as September, as originally reported by the Financial Times. This AI chip would be based on Nvidia’s Blackwell RTX Pro 6000 processor, which is already modified to meet the existing AI chip restrictions, the Financial Times added. These chips wouldn’t include high-bandwidth memory or NVLink, Nvidia’s high-speed but low-latency communication interface, both of which are features of the company’s advanced AI chips. Last month, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said the company would no longer include the Chinese market in its revenue and profit forecasts. Maybe that will be a short-lived change. Nvidia declined to comment on the news. An Nvidia spokesperson added, “With the current export controls, we are effectively out of the China datacenter market, which is now served only by competitors such as Huawei. China has one of the largest populations of developers in the world, creating open-source foundation models and non-military applications used globally. While security is paramount, every one of those applications should run best on the U.S. AI stack.”"

    "summary": "If you've been itching to invest in a robot vacuum to help you clean up around the house, you're in luck. Prime Day deals, like clockwork, have brought discounts to a bunch of our favorite robot vacuums and there are still plenty available now. One of the best deals is on this Shark AI Ultra robovac, which you can grab for 50 percent off — just $298.\nThis is a version of one of the top picks in our best robot vacuums guide. It boasts excellent suction power and a bagless, auto-empty base that's super convenient. Shark's mobile app is easy to use as well, allowing you to set cleaning schedules and see the home map the robot creates so you can select specific areas and rooms to clean. \n\n\nThe battery life is decent, at 120 minutes per charge. Like most modern robovacs, it'll head back to the power outlet on its own. During use, we found that the vacuum did a pretty good job at avoiding obstacles and managed to sidestep the many cat toys strewn across the floor.\nMany other Shark products are also on sale right now. This includes other robovacs, but also standard upright designs. Here are some of the highlights.\n\nShark AV2501S AI Ultra robot vacuum for $250 (55 percent off): A version of our favorite robot vacuum, this Shark machine has strong suction power and won't choke at the first sight of pet hair or big dust bunnies. Its self-emptying base is bagless as well, which means you won't have to buy propriety bags to refill it with over time. This auto-empty base has a 30-day capacity.\nShark PowerDetect NeverTouch Pro robot vacuum and mop for $700 (42 percent off): This Shark machine is one of our favorites in part because it truly lives up to its name. Thanks to its self-emptying dock that handles vacuumed debris along with clean and dirty mopping water, you really don't have to touch the thing for at least 30 days in between cleanings. We found it to be a solid autonomous dirt sucker, and its mopping capabilities are quite good to match.\nShark PowerDetect Clean & Empty cordless vacuum for $400 (33 percent off): Shark's cordless vacuums are just as good as their robot vacuums, and you can usually find them on sale for less than other major brands. This one has great suction power and a relatively lightweight design, but the fact that it comes with a self-emptying base makes it an ultra-convenient choice.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/shark-robot-vacuums-are-up-to-half-off-in-these-prime-day-deals-170023907.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Earlier this week, Grok, X's built-in chatbot, took a hard turn toward antisemitism following a recent update. Amid unprompted, hateful rhetoric against Jews, it even began referring to itself as MechaHitler, a reference to 1992's Wolfenstein 3D. X has been working to delete the chatbot's offensive posts. But it's safe to say many are left wondering how this sort of thing can even happen.\nI spoke to Solomon Messing, a research professor at New York University's Center for Social Media and Politics, to get a sense of what may have gone wrong with Grok. Before his current stint in academia, Messing worked in the tech industry, including at Twitter, where he founded the company's applied sciences research team. He was also there for the early stages of Elon Musk's takeover.\nThe first thing to understand about how chatbots like Grok work is that they're built on large language models (LLMs) designed to mimic natural language. LLMs are pretrained on giant swaths of text, including books, academic papers and, yes, even social media posts. The training process allows AI models to generate coherent text through a predictive algorithm. However, those predictive capabilities are only as good as the numerical values or \"weights\" that an AI algorithm learns to assign to the signals it's later asked to interpret. Through a process known as post-training, AI researchers can fine-tune the weights their models assign to input data, thereby changing the outputs they generate.\n\"If a model has seen content like this during pretraining, there's the potential for the model to mimic the style and substance of the worst offenders on the internet,\" said Messing.\nIn short, the pre-training data is where everything starts. If an AI model hasn’t seen hateful, anti-antisemitic content, it won’t be aware of the sorts of patterns that inform that kind of speech — including phrases such as \"Heil Hitler\"  —  and, as a result, it probably won't regurgitate them to the user.\nIn the statement X shared after the episode, the company admitted there were areas where Grok's training could be improved. \"We are aware of recent posts made by Grok and are actively working to remove the inappropriate posts. Since being made aware of the content, xAI has taken action to ban hate speech before Grok posts on X,\" the company said. \"xAI is training only truth-seeking and thanks to the millions of users on X, we are able to quickly identify and update the model where training could be improved.\"\nScreenshots via X\nAs I saw people post screenshots of Grok's responses, one thought I had was that what we were watching was a reflection of X's changing userbase. It's no secret xAI has been using data from X to train Grok; easier access to the platform's trove of information is part of the reason Musk said he was merging the two companies in March. What's more, X's userbase has become more right wing under Musk's ownership of the site. In effect, there may have been a poisoning of the well that is Grok's training data. Messing isn't so certain.\n\"Could the pre-training data for Grok be getting more hateful over time? Sure, if you remove content moderation over time, the userbase might get more and more oriented toward people who are tolerant of hateful speech [...]  thus the pre-training data drifts in a more hateful direction,\" Messing said. \"But without knowing what's in the training data, it's hard to say for sure.\"\nIt also wouldn't explain how Grok became so antisemitic after just a single update. On social media, there has been speculation that a rogue system prompt may explain what happened. System prompts are a set of instructions AI model developers give to their chatbots before the start of a conversation. They give the model a set of guidelines to adhere to, and define the tools it can turn to for help in answering a prompt.\nIn May xAI blamed \"an unauthorized modification\" to Grok's prompt on X for the chatbot's brief obsession with \"white genocide\" in South Africa. The fact that the change was made at 3:15AM PT made many suspect Elon Musk had done the tweak himself. Following the incident, xAI open sourced Grok's system prompts, allowing people to view them publicly on GitHub. After Tuesday's episode, people noticed xAI had deleted a recently added system prompt that told Grok its responses should \"not shy away from making claims which are politically incorrect, as long as they are well substantiated.\"\nMessing also doesn't believe the deleted system prompt is the smoking gun some online believe it to be.\n\"If I were trying to ensure a model didn't respond in hateful/racist ways I would try to do that during post-training, not as a simple system prompt. Or at the very least, I would have a hate speech detection model running that would censor or provide negative feedback to model generations that were clearly hateful,\" he said. \"So it's hard to say for sure, but if that one system prompt was all that was keeping xAI from going off the rails with Nazi rhetoric, well that would be like attaching the wings to a plane with duct tape.\"\nHe added: \"I would definitely say a shift in training, like a new training approach or having a different pre-training or post-training setup would more likely explain this than a system prompt, particularly when that system prompt doesn’t explicitly say, 'Do not say things that Nazis would say.'\"\nOn Wednesday, Musk suggested Grok was effectively baited into being hateful. \"Grok was too compliant to user prompts,\" he said. \"Too eager to please and be manipulated, essentially. That is being addressed.\" According to Messing, there is some validity to that argument, but it doesn't provide the full picture. \"Musk isn’t necessarily wrong,\" he said,  \"There’s a whole art to 'jailbreaking' an LLM, and it’s tough to fully guard against in post-training. But I don’t think that fully explains the set of instances of pro-Nazi text generations from Grok that we saw.\"\nIf there's one takeaway from this episode, it's that one of the issues with foundational AI models is just how little we know about their inner workings. As Messing points out, even with Meta's open-weight Llama models, we don't really know what ingredients are going into the mix. \"And that's one of the fundamental problems when we're trying to understand what's happening in any foundational model,\" he said, \"we don't know what the pre-training data is.\"\nIn the specific case of Grok, we don't have enough information right now to know for sure what went wrong. It could have been a single trigger like an errant system prompt, or, more likely, a confluence of factors that includes the system's training data. However, Messing suspects we may see another incident just like it in the future.\n\"[AI models] are not the easiest things to control and align,\" he said. \"And if you're moving fast and not putting in the proper guardrails, then you're privileging progress over a sort of care. Then, you know, things like this are not surprising.\"This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/how-exactly-did-grok-go-full-mechahitler-151020144.html?src=rss",

The thinking seems to be that ITV’s typically older viewing demographic could be drawn to Disney’s more adult-focused shows, with ITV’s output likely to appeal to streaming audiences that skew younger.

Netflix has been licensing shows from the BBC and Channel 4 in the UK for a number of years, for example, and back in 2022 Disney and the BBC started co-producing Doctor Who, with Disney+ becoming the home of the long-running sci-fi show outside of the UK.

    "full_text": "In Brief U.K. authorities confirmed on Thursday they had arrested four individuals for allegedly carrying out a series of hacks earlier this year targeting the British retail sector, including Marks & Spencer, Harrods, and the Co-op. The National Crime Agency said a woman aged 20, two men aged 19, and a youth aged 17 were arrested on Thursday at locations across the U.K. under suspicion of hacking, blackmail, money laundering, and participating in an organized crime group. The suspects weren’t named, but were taken into custody in relation to the hacks, the NCA said. Starting in April, hackers started breaking in and stealing customer data from the Co-op, and later Marks & Spencer. Both intrusions were attributed to Scattered Spider, a collective of hackers and techniques that use impersonation and deception tactics to trick call centers and company help desks into granting them access to their networks. The hackers allegedly used their access to allow a ransomware gang called DragonForce to deploy its file-encrypting malware on Marks & Spencer’s network. The Co-op reportedly avoided the ransomware by pulling down its own network before the hackers could activate the malware. Harrods, too, said it rebuffed much of a cyberattack."

There's a fully customizable EQ that can be adjusted via the affiliated app. The battery life is fantastic here, offering 24 hours of use per charge. Also, there's a quick-charge feature that provides 2.5 hours of use from a 15 minute trip to the outlet. \n\n\nAs to the name, these cans include plush, padded earcups and an adjustable padded band. They should be comfortable for all-day use. We haven't gotten a chance to review this particular model, but we loved the QuietComfort Ultra headphones. They even found a spot on our list of the best wireless headphones. Bose typically makes great stuff.\nThe headphones do come with a microphone, but some reviews suggest the quality is a bit off when compared to rival units.

The news that Grok would be coming to Tesla vehicles soon comes several hours after xAI debuted the latest flagship AI model, Grok 4. Fans had wondered loudly why Musk spent an hour late on Wednesday talking about Grok with no mention of a Tesla integration, which likely prompted the billionaire’s early morning announcement. Musk is known for making Tesla-related announcements on X, the social media platform he owns, oftentimes before he even tells his own engineers. In this case, they might have seen it coming. Musk has teased that Grok would end up in Tesla vehicles as an AI assistant for months, saying that Tesla drivers would be able to chat conversationally with their cars and ask Grok to perform certain tasks. While poking around in Tesla’s firmware, a hacker who goes by the name “green” last week found that drivers can choose between certain Grok “personalities,” including ones that are NSFW (not safe for work). Green’s findings also suggest that Grok will only be available on newer vehicles with Hardware 3. Grok will also be the voice and brain for Tesla’s humanoid robot Optimus, Musk confirmed recently."

The rule was set to take effect on July 14. Reuters reports that the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in St. Louis said on Wednesday that the FTC, which passed the rule under former Democratic Chair Lina Khan, had failed to conduct a preliminary analysis of the costs and benefits of the rule. The regulation would have required businesses to allow customers to cancel their subscriptions using the same method they used to sign up. For example, if signing up for a membership only took a few clicks, canceling it shouldn’t require navigating through numerous web pages or dealing with a chatbot. The rule would also have required businesses to obtain consent before charging customers for memberships, auto-renewals, or programs tied to free trial offers."

    "summary": "Amazon Prime Day is usually met with competing sales from other retailers, and this year is no different. Walmart’s summer sale is back this year, competing with Prime Day and running for an extra two days. You can shop the sale at Walmart from July 8 through July 13, snagging discounts on all sorts of things including tech.\nWhile Engadget covers all of the best Prime Day deals we can find, we also recognize that not everyone has a Prime membership — and many simply do not want to shop at Amazon. If you fall into either of those camps, you will be able to find some of the best Prime Day deals matched at Walmart. Most of these deals are available to everyone, too — no Walmart Plus membership required as of July 8. Here, we’ve collected the best Walmart Deals savings we could find that you can still get right now.\nBest Walmart Deals 2025 discounts\nRoku Express HD streaming device for $17 ($12 off): If you're simply looking for an affordable streamer to upgrade an aging TV, the Roku Express HD could fit the bill. It plays HD-quality content and gives you access to every major streaming platform including HBO Max, Disney+, Prime Video and others. It'll tuck away behind your set nicely and it supports headphone mode, which lets you connect headphones to the Roku mobile app for private listening and viewing from your TV.\nRazer Kraken Hello Kitty & Friends Bluetooth headset for $47 (47 percent off): Razer makes excellent gaming accessories and this Hello Kitty & Friends version of the popular Kraken headset might be just what you were looking for to add more personality into your Twitch stream outfits. Aside from the cute design, it supports Bluetooth 5.0, comes with 40mm drivers and sports a beamforming microphone.\nGoogle TV Streamer 4K for $84 ($16 off): Our top favorite streaming device, the Google TV Streamer 4K is basically a souped-up Chromecast with 4K content support, an easy to use interface and a great remote control.\nSamsung Galaxy Watch 6 for $129 (47 percent off): While it's an older model, we generally like Samsung Galaxy Watches and they're arguably the best smartwatches for Samsung phone users. The Galaxy Watch 6 has good all-day activity tracking and sleep monitoring, plus heart rate tracking, personalized health insights and more.\nSamsung 32-inch Smart Monitor M5 for $199 ($100 off): Not only will this be a good monitor for your home office setup, but it also acts as a full smart TV, too. Its interface gives you access to platforms like Netflix, Prime Video, YouTube and others, and it also comes with a SmartThings IoT hub built in so you can connect and control things like smart lights directly from the monitor.\nSony WH-1000XM5 headphones for $296 ($104 off): While the XM6 headphones are the latest and greatest, they only make small changes to the already stellar XM5. These were our top pick for the best wireless headphones for a long time before the XM6 launched earlier this year, and we still like them for their excellent sound quality, strong ANC, multi-device connectivity and good battery life.\nHisense 75-inch U6H ULED 4K smart TV for $448 (36 percent off): This Quantum Dot TV can reach 600 nits at peak brightness across its 48 local dimming zones. It supports Dolby Vision and Atmos, HDMI 2.1 inputs for a better gaming experience and it has the Google Assistant built in for voice control.\nPlayStation 5 Slim Astro Bot bundle for $453 ($106 off): This version of the console has a disc drive and comes with 1TB of storage, plus the ever-popular Astro Bot game.\nApple MacBook Air (13-inch, M1) for $599 ($50 off): The M1 Air has been long gone from Apple's own site, but it's still a more than capable laptop for anyone looking for a solid, all-purpose machine. We still recommend springing for an M3 or M4 machine instead, but if you're on a budget, this deal will be hard to beat.\nMSI Thin A15 gaming laptop (15.6-inch, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD) for $649 (37 percent off): Along with a Ryzen processor, this MSI gaming laptop sports a NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060 GPU and a 144Hz screen, and it comes in at just about 4 pounds in weight.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/walmart-deals-2025-rivals-prime-day-with-sales-up-to-47-percent-off-230146367.html?src=rss",

Perhaps the nicest quality of life change is the ability to mix and match MVP animations with any skins, instead of having certain MVP animations locked to specific skins."

    "summary": "With pricier Wi-Fi 7 models now available, you can find good deals on Wi-Fi 6 routers.",
    "full_text": "We focus on three main measurements when testing routers: speed, reliability and distance. Even the most reliable internet connections are fairly erratic: factors like time of day, network congestion and even the condition of your neighborhood’s broadband infrastructure can all affect your internet speed. All Wi-Fi signals travel through 2.5GHz and 5GHz radio frequencies -- that’s why most routers you’ll see are referred to as “dual-band.” (Tri-band routers use an extra set of channels in the 6GHz band.) As any online gamer or remote worker can tell you, speed isn’t the only factor in evaluating routers. We felt jitter was a better measure than latency when evaluating a router, as average latency can show up in testing as low, even when an internet connection is glitchy. These tests also captured packet loss, which tells us whether any data failed to reach its destination during the test. The second step in our testing is to measure each router’s wireless signal strength and broadcasting capability. CNET’s labs have many electronics being tested around the facility, and it shares walls with other businesses, so there’s plenty of interference for a router to work through. We taped targets in 61 locations around CNET’s 12,500-square-foot testing facility to see how well each router transmitted data through obstacles like walls and electronics. A value like -55 dBm is considered strong enough and typically correlates with high throughput."

    "full_text": "Take this question that is of vital economic importance to California: How many fire breaks does the state have that might stop a wildfire in its tracks, and how have they changed since the last fire season? LGND recently raised a $9 million seed round led by Javelin Venture Partners, the company exclusively told TechCrunch. Geographic embeddings summarize spatial data in a way that makes it easier to find relationships between different points on Earth. “Embeddings get you 90% of all the undifferentiated compute up front,” Nuño said. Each of them will appear differently on a map, but they all share certain characteristics. For one, pixels that make up an image of a fire break won’t have any vegetation. Embeddings make it much easier to find places on a map that match those descriptions. Manning sees LGND’s embeddings encouraging companies to query geospatial data in entirely new ways. Building traditional geospatial models to answer those questions would be time-consuming for just one query, let alone all of them together. “We’re trying to be the Standard Oil for this data,” Manning said."

    "summary": "It doesn't take much to play games these days. Phone, console, PC or handheld are all viable options. But why play using the bare minimum when you can upgrade your setup on the cheap by snagging a deal or two during Amazon Prime Day. Just a couple of key improvements can make a huge impact on how you enjoy a game or even how you play it. But instead of wasting your free time combing through thousands of listings yourself, we've collected the best gaming discounts and promos into a single place so you can get back to the action as fast as possible.\nBest Prime Day deals on video games\n\n\nThe Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom (Nintendo Switch) for $52 ($8 off) \nWe rarely see discounts on first-party Nintendo games, especially when it comes to major franchises like The Legend of Zelda. But for Prime Day, Echoes of Wisdom is available for 15 percent off, which is even more impressive when you consider the game the game is less than a year old. Not only is this the first Zelda game to put our beloved princess in the spotlight (instead of Link), it offers a fun twist on the series' classic top-down action RPG formula thanks to Zelda's new ability to summon objects and monsters with the Tri-rod.\nThe Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom (Nintendo Switch) for $53 ($17 off)\nAlternatively, if you are looking for something a bit faster paced, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom may be one of the best sequels in recent video game history. And now for Prime Day, it's available for $17 off its normal retail price. Not only is this a great pickup for anyone who hasn't played it yet, it's also a great showcase of the Switch 2's capabilities as users can purchase a $10 upgrade pack (or get it for free if you have a subscription to Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack) that adds support for HDR, faster loading times, enhanced textures and smoother framerates. \nStar Wars Outlaws - Limited Edition (Amazon Exclusive), PlayStation 5 for $29 ($31 off)\nAt full price, this game was easy to skip. But now that it's available for just $29 (half off its normal retail price), Star Wars Outlaws suddenly becomes a lot more interesting for fans of the franchise. You get to live out your dreams of being an intergalactic scoundrel while taking down bounties or battling secret crime syndicates. And because this is the limited edition, the game includes some pre-order rewards like the Kessel Run bonus pack and the Rogue Infiltrator bundle.\nAssassin’s Creed Shadows - Limited Edition for PS5/Xbox Series X for $48 ($22 off)\nIf you missed the latest entry in Ubisoft's most well-known franchise, this might be the time to jump in because for Prime Day, Assassin's Creed Shadows is available for $48, more than $20 off its regular retail price. This instalment has you explore feudal Japan as either the shinobi Naoe or the legendary samurai Yasuke while encountering some notable figures from the time period. If all you want is a wonderful world to sneak around in, it's hard to go wrong with Assassin's Creed on a discount.\nElden Ring: Shadow of The Erdtree Edition for PS5/Xbox Series X for $60 ($20 off)\nElden Ring is one of the most highly regarded games of this decade so far (and arguably of all time). For Prime Day, you can become a foul tarnished by picking up a version that includes the base game and the Shadow of the Erdtree expansion for $60. Elden Ring typically costs around $50 (though it's down to $30 on PS4, PS5 and Xbox Series X for Prime Day) and the DLC will usually run you another $40, so that's a decent discount compared with buying them separately — or even the Shadow of the Erdtree Edition at its regular price. \nThe Last of Us Part I – PlayStation 5 for $30 ($40 off)\nThe Last of Us is one of the greatest modern video game franchises, spawning both a critically acclaimed sequel and TV adaptation. For Prime Day, you can now get part one of the remastered version for more than 50 percent off. This latest edition for the PS5 features a brand new game engine, improved loading speeds and haptic feedback support for Sony's DualSense controller and more, which is enough to make the series feel like an entirely new experience (even if you played the original back in the day). And while it isn't getting as big of a discount, you can also pick up The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered on Amazon for just $40 (10 off its regular price).\nFinal Fantasy I-VI Collection Anniversary Edition for PlayStation and Switch for $66 ($9 off)\nThis collection of pixel remasters of the first six Final Fantasy games is discounted by $9 during Prime Day. Several other games in the series are on sale for PS5 as well, such as Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade ($30, $10 off), Final Fantasy VII Rebirth ($40, $30 off) and Final Fantasy XVI ($25, $15 off)\nBest Prime Day deals on VR headsets\nMeta Quest 3S 128GB Bundle for $249 ($51 off)\nThe Quest 3S is one of our picks for best VR headsets for good reason. Meta cut just the right corners from the more full-featured Quest 3, enabling it to drop the list price down lower. It has the same Snapdragon chip and controlers, but cheaps out a bit on the lenses, slightly lowering the graphics fidelity in use. Just like the Quest 3, it works standalone for lighter games and streaming, or in concert with a gaming PC for full-fat AAA VR titles. It's well worth the $300 Meta usually asks for it, so at $249 with two games included (Cardboard Hero and the excellent social VR hit Gorilla Tag), it's a steal.\nBest Prime Day deals on PCs and PC components\nRazer Blade 14 with RTX 4070 for $2,300 ($400 off)\nThe Blade 14 is one of my favorite laptop lines because it combines a super sleek chassis with solid performance and truly excellent build quality. And now, as a way to get in on the Prime Day festivities, Razer has an exclusive offer on its website that will knock $400 off configs with RTX 4070 GPUs or up to $300 on models with RTX 4060 cards. These kind of savings go a long way towards neutralizing my biggest issue with Razer's laptops: their price. So if you're looking for a system that can do some serious gaming but is still easy to carry around, you're going to want to snap this deal up fast. \nAMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D 16-Core processor for $664 ($35 off)\nAMD's X3D chips are the cream of the crop when it comes to gaming performance and while it's only enjoying a $35 discount right now, informed buyers know that the real savings are bigger than that because these chips often go for well above their MSRP. But the best thing is that for Prime Day, in addition to the 9950X3D, there are a bunch of other X3D processors on sale right now including the $460 Ryzen 7 9800X3D and $265 Ryzen 7 5700X3D so you can pick the right component for your budget. If you need a new CPU to speed up your gaming rig, now is a great time to upgrade.\nASUS ROG Strix G16 Gaming Laptop with RTX 4060 for $1,360 ($340 off)\nWhile an RTX 4060 isn't the most powerful GPU on the market, getting a whole new laptop with solid specs for just $1,360 isn't something you can just ignore, especially if you're on a budget. This ROG Strix G16 comes with 16GB of RAM and 1TB of storage. And while its Intel Core i9-14900HX CPU is one generation old, it's still plenty fast enough for gaming, video editing or pretty much anything else you need to do. I also appreciate small features like a MUX switch that lets the laptop connect directly to the GPU for increased performance, though if you want, you can also enable automatic switching for better battery life. And with a 16-inch 240Hz QHD display with 100% DCI-P3 coverage, everything on screen is sure to look great.\nAcer Nitro V gaming laptop with NVIDIA RTX 4060 GPU for $1,200 ($150 off, lowest ever price)\nAcer's Nitro gaming laptops are meant to be more affordable alternatives to its flagship Predator systems. But now thanks to Prime Day, this model just got even more budget-friendly while still offering decent specs. You get an Intel Core i9-13900H CPU with 32GB of RAM, 1TB of storage and an RTX 4060 GPU, the latter of which should pair nicely with its 15.6-inch full HD 144Hz display. I also appreciate that unlike some gaming laptops, the Nitro V is stylish without being in your face with too many RGB lights, which makes it feel like an even better deal at $1,200. That's the lowest price we've seen to date for this configuration.\nCorsair Vengeance RGB DDR5 RAM 32GB (2x16GB) RAM for $95 ($25 off)\nAdding some extra memory to your desktop can help unlock its full potential. So for Prime Day, Corsair is offering two 16GB sticks of its Vengeance DDR5 RAM for just $95. Not only do you get built-in RGB lighting, Corsair's onboard voltage regulation makes it simpler to overclock your system. And for those who don't want to mess around in BIOS settings, you can control almost everything from the easy-to-use free iCue app.\nThermaltake GF1 (2024) Fully Modular ATX 850W Power Supply for $80 ($30 off, lowest ever price)\nEven though power supplies aren't the most exciting component you can put in your desktop, the importance of a good one can't be understated. For just $80, which is the lowest price we've seen to date for this product, the Thermaltake GF1 is fully modular (which means you can add or remove power cables as you need them) and has an ample max power of 850 watts along with an 80 Plus Gold rating for efficiency. And thanks to its 140mm fan, it should be pretty quiet, so it won't cause a ruckus if you decide to play some games at night.\nSamsung 990 EVO Plus 2TB PCIe M.2 SSD for $114 ($63 off)\nIf you're like me and are constantly running out of storage, this deal for one of Samsung's 990 EVO Plus 2TB M.2 SSDs is a fantastic way to add extra room on the cheap. With a 36 percent discount for Prime Day — down to $114 — this is the lowest price we've ever seen. And it's not like you're cutting corners on speed either, as the SSD supports both PCIe 4.0 x4 and PCIe 5.0 x2 and read/write rates of up to 7,250/6,300MB/s.\nAMD Ryzen 5 9600X 6-Core, 12-Thread Unlocked Processor for $156 ($123 off)\nThe Ryzen 5 9600X isn't super flashy, but it's a really solid budget CPU. And now, it’s even more affordable during Prime Day where it's going for just $156, which is $123 off its normal retail price. It features six cores and 12 total threads with a max boost speed of 5.4GHz and support for DDR5 RAM and PCIe Gen 5. It's also unlocked, so you have the freedom to overlock if you want. That said, you will need to buy a CPU cooler separately, as one doesn't come in the box.\nAMD Ryzen 9 9950X 16-Core, 32-Thread Unlocked Desktop Processor for $434 ($215 off)\nThe biggest issue with the Ryzen 9 9950X CPU was that at launch, it was a bit overpriced. But during Prime Day, that problem is being addressed thanks to a $215 discount that brings its cost down to under $500. The CPU features 16 cores and 32 threads along with 80MB of cache and support for DDR5 RAM and PCIe Gen 5. However, like some of AMD's other processors on sale this week, you will need to get a CPU cooler separately.\nBest Prime Day deals on gaming peripherals\nRazer Enki Gaming Chair for $450 ($50 off)\nIf you're going to be spending all day in front of a screen gaming, you better make sure whatever you're sitting on is super comfy. And as I've been using the Razer Enki every day for the last four years, I can attest that this chair is worth the money. It has a ton of adjustability for things like the arm rests, seat height and more. For more flexible folks, it was even designed so people can sit cross-legged. I also appreciate that in homes where neon green might not fit your vibe, there's an all-black model (plus a pink one too, though that one is currently sold out).\nElgato Stream Deck MK.2 for $110 ($40 off, lowest ever)\nIf you've ever dreamed about becoming a gaming streamer or simply want some extra customizable controls for your PC, Elgato's Stream Deck MK.2 could make a great addition to your setup. It has 15 programmable macro keys with built-in LCD displays so you can make custom buttons for switching scenes, turning on lights and so much more. Elgato also has plugins for services like YouTube, Twitch, Discord, so it'll play nicely with all the major streaming platforms. In short, it's like a command center for all your content creation and livestreaming needs.\nLogitech G305 Lightspeed Wireless Gaming Mouse for $29 ($21 off)\nThe Logitech G305 Lightspeed gaming mouse is just a simple PC peripheral done well. And at just $29, it's super affordable during Prime Day too. It features six programmable buttons, compatibility with both PCs and Macs and a sensor with sensitivity of up to 12,000 DPI. Meanwhile, thanks to a battery that lasts up to 250 hours between charges, you can go weeks between needing to plug it in. And because it's wireless, there won't be any cords or cables to get in your way.\nAmazon Luna Controller and one month of Luna+ for $40 ($30 off)\nThe Luna Controller by itself is down to $40, which matches a record-low price. However, if you're a newcomer to Luna+, you may as well pick up this bundle (which is also matching a record low) for the same price, as it includes one month of access to the service for new subscribers. This gamepad is a solid option for those who want to check out Luna, Amazon's cloud gaming service. Prime subscribers get access to a dedicated channel with a rotating selection of games at no extra cost. This month, for instance, you can check out Death Stranding Director's Cut, Hollow Knight and EA Sports FC 25. \n8BitDo Retro Mechanical Keyboard for $80 ($20 off)\nWith its Retro Mechanical Keyboard, 8BitDo strikes a great balance between a nostalgic design and support for more modern features like wireless connectivity (both BT and 2.4GHz). There are several different versions to choose from, though the one inspired by the classic NES is the model I'd choose. The keyboard features an 87-key layout with PBT keycaps and Kailh Box switches, though because the PCB is hot swappable, you can always change them out for something else.\nSony Inzone H9 Wireless Gaming Headset for $198 ($102 off)\nFor anyone looking for a new pair of over-the-ear wireless gaming headphones to pair with a PS5, it's hard to do better than Sony's Inzone H9 headset. Not only does it have a similar design to the console, they are the only other headphones besides the official Pulse cans that support on-screen status notifications for volume, mic mute, game/chat balance and more. They also share a lot of the underlying tech used in Sony's iconic WH-1000XM line, so you'll get fantastic audio quality and active noise cancellation. But the best part is that at $198, you're looking at a serious discount of 34 percent, which is more than $100 off its regular retail price.\nSeagate Storage Expansion Card 2TB Solid State Drive for $209 ($21 off)\nGames are getting bigger every day, so if you need some extra storage for your Xbox Series S or X, you'd be silly not to pick up one of Seagate's 2TB Expansion Cards for just $209. That's enough room for a dozen or more digital titles (or like three versions of Call of Duty) and it's the biggest SSD storage module that slots into the back of the console without the need for a separate box.\nAmazon Basics UPS Battery Backup & Surge Protector 800VA/450W for $65 ($10 off)\nI'm not here to nag, but if you have a desktop PC, you really ought to consider adding a UPS (uninterruptible power supply) to your setup as they prevent power surges or momentary outages from knocking your system offline. Plus, this one has a beefy 450-watt battery backup and 12 outlets so you can connect all of your other PC gadgets to it. So if you're going to do the smart thing by adding some extra electrical protection to your home during Prime Day, you might as well save some money in the process.\nBest Prime Day deals on mobile gaming gear\nSamsung Galaxy S25 Ultra (512GB) for $1,055 ($365 off)\nWith Samsung's next Unpacked event expected to show off new foldables, it looks like some of the existing models are getting some serious discounts for Prime Day, including the Galaxy S25 Ultra. And at $1,055, this is the lowest price we've seen for Samsung's current flagship phone yet. For gamers, thanks to its Snapdragon 8 Elite chip, the S25 Ultra offers some of the best performance you can get in a phone right now, while its built-in vapor chamber should help prevent throttling. Its 6.9-inch AMOLED display is also one of the best mobile screens on the market today.\nRazer Kishi Ultra for $100 ($50 off)\nRazer doesn't normally run a ton of deals for Prime Day, but it seems this year the company is making an exception as there are discounts on everything from gamepads to headsets and more. That said, one of the standout deals is for the Kishi Ultra gaming controller. On top of just being a well-built gamepad add-on for phones and tablets, its larger dimension and USB-C port means it works with a huge range of devices — both Android and iOS. This even includes more niche devices like foldables like the Galaxy Z Fold series, which often don't fit inside other mobile gamepads due to their unique design.\nBest Prime Day deals on gaming monitors and TVs\nSony 85-Inch Class 4K Ultra HD Bravia 3 LED TV for $1,098 ($500 off)\nThere's no better way to upgrade your living room gaming setup than with a brand-new, big-ass TV. Granted, the Bravia 3 is one of Sony's entry-level models (fancier sets get higher numbers), but with a discounted price of $1,098 for a massive 85-inch panel, this deal represents one of the biggest screens you can get for the money. It also has Google TV built in, so you'll get a very simple and straightforward way to stream your favorite shows and movies from services like Netflix, HBO and more. But perhaps most importantly is that for PS5 owners, the Bravia 3 supports exclusive features when connected to a PS5, such as Auto HDR Tone Mapping and Auto Genre Picture mode.\nBy the way, for a more in-depth look at the best TV discounts, check out our dedicated guide covering the best TV deals for Amazon Prime Day 2025.\nAlienware AW2725DF 26.7-inch OLED gaming monitor for $600 ($300 off)\nFor anyone who has been waiting for prices of OLED gaming monitors to drop, this may be your chance to pounce on a great deal. That's because at $600, Alienware's 26.7-inch OLED display strikes a good balance between price and performance with a 360Hz refresh rate, 2560 x 1440 resolution and support for AMD FreeSync Premium Pro. And of course, you get those lovely pure blacks and vivid colors that OLED panels have become known for.\nSamsung Odyssey Neo G9 Series 57-inch 4K 240Hz 4K gaming monitor for $1,600 ($700 off)\nThis 57-inch monitor isn't for people with limited space. But if you've got the room, at $1,600, this is the lowest we've ever seen the Neo G9 as this deal represents a whopping $700 savings compared to its regular list price. This thing features a solid 240Hz refresh rate along with support for AMD FreeSync Premium Pro, a 1000R curve and Quantum mini LED tech with 2,392 local dimming zones. For people who love ultra-wide displays, this should be at the top of your upgrade list during Amazon Prime Day.\nAcer Nitro 27-inch WQHD IPS gaming monitor for $170 ($120 off)\nAnyone looking for a solid and affordable 1440p gaming monitor during Prime Day should really check out this 27-inch IPS display from Acer. For just $170 (matching a record-low price), it features a relatively speedy 180Hz refresh rate along with support for AMD FreeSync Premium and a good color range that covers 95 percent of DCI-P3. The height-adjustable stand can also swivel and pivot, while thin bezels on top and on the sides will make sure it won't look dated in a few years. So while this thing isn't super fancy, it's simple and competent in the best ways.\nBest Prime Day deals on batteries and power packs\nUGREEN Magnetic Power Bank 10,000mAh fast charging battery pack for $30 ($3 off)\nThe Switch 2 is a fantastic handheld, but its longevity could be better. So if you're planning to take it on a long trip, pick up UGREEN's 10,000mAH fast charging battery pack to help keep running when you're away from a plug. This power pack almost has enough juice to fully refill a Switch 2 twice, which can add between five and 12 hours of additional game time (depending on the title). It also has an output of 20 watts, which is as much as the Switch 2 can suck down at once, but it's still super pocketable measuring just four inches long and 0.7 inches thick. And if you need a convenient way to recharge your phone, the battery pack also comes with Qi wireless support.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/we-found-the-best-prime-day-gaming-deals-on-video-games-hardware-and-more-144228655.html?src=rss",

Not only do you get built-in RGB lighting, Corsair's onboard voltage regulation makes it simpler to overclock your system.

    "summary": "We typically see solid deals on headphones and earbuds for Prime Day every year, and this time around is no different. We're a couple days into Prime Day now, but one of the best deals is still in stock: Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones are on sale for up to $152 off. The black option has that steep discount, bringing it down to $248. All other colorways are $102 off and down to $298. These are some of the best discounts we've seen on these cans all year.\nThese headphones once topped our list of the best wireless headphones before being usurped by the XM6. They are still fantastic, despite being slightly outshined by the newer kid on the block. We praised the \"supreme comfort\" and \"great sound\" in our official review, along with the powerful ANC technology. \n\n\nThe battery life is also incredible here. Users can expect around 30 hours per charge, which will more than handle a long train ride or flight. It's also lighter than the XM4, which adds to the overall comfort. There are touch controls on the outside panel of the right ear cup, with the ability to play, pause, skip tracks and adjust the volume.\nThese cans also work with various voice assistants and there's an affiliated app that allows for even more customization. The headphones offer multipoint connectivity and there are a handful of integrated microphones for phone calls. The only downside here remains the price, which has been somewhat alleviated by this sale.\nIf your budget is tighter, Sony still sells the WH-1000XM4 headphones and they're on sale for $185 thanks to Prime Day. Since the XM6 cans are the latest and greatest, this model is getting a bit old at this point — but it could be a good option for those looking to spend less than $200 on a good set of ANC headphones.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/get-up-to-152-off-the-sony-wh-1000xm5-headphones-for-prime-day-123544251.html?src=rss",

On Thursday, Knox said it has raised a $6.5 million seed round led by Felicis, with participation from Ridgeline and FirsthandVC. Denisenko decided to embark on this journey after she learned firsthand the challenges of obtaining FedRAMP. Class, an education startup where she served as COO, had secured a contract to sell its software to the U.S. Air Force. The acquisition helped Class receive FedRAMP certification in just six months. “Class would still be getting FedRAMP today” if it had tried to obtain the clearance on its own, Denisenko told TechCrunch. Save $450 on your TechCrunch All Stage pass Build smarter. And as the government increasingly adopts more software, she hopes Knox can help SaaS vendors gain FedRAMP to access government contracts more easily. The company’s software runs a continuous series of tests and audits to identify where the customer’s infrastructure, code, and security controls are falling short of FedRAMP standards, and either remediates those issues itself or flags them to the customer. While FedRAMP authorization management may seem like a niche offering, Knox has one large competitor: Palantir."

Haq and Brugger both told TechCrunch that Diligent was a natural next step for them. Haq added that autonomous vehicles are fundamentally mobile robots, just called a different name. Brugger said that he was also drawn to Diligent because it had a lot of the same operational challenges and priorities as Cruise. So I think that sort of pyramid is the same.

As he will perform both leadership roles simultaneously, it’s likely that his NASA tenure will be focused on implementing Trump’s near-term policy goals. Those goals include wide-ranging cuts to NASA’s budget that will likely slash many science initiatives and steeply reduce its workforce. Duffy’s appointment comes just weeks after Trump abruptly withdrew his nomination of billionaire entrepreneur Jared Isaacman to NASA administrator. Isaacman, who made his fortune from his company Shift4 Payments, has flown to space twice on private SpaceX missions. Trump said he rescinded support following a “thorough review of prior associations,” citing Isaacman’s donations to Democratic candidates and the billionaire’s close ties to SpaceX CEO Elon Musk.

But there's another narrative line being explored in this movie that may not be as obvious. This brings me back to that throwaway moment between Lois and Superman I referenced above. It turns out, Brosnahan's Lois Lane has a punk rock backstory. I kept thinking there had to be more going on here with this punk rock detail. I started thinking about Gunn's journey as a filmmaker from his early cult movie days with Troma to his subversive genre work with films like Slither, Super and Brightburn, the 2019 movie that inverted Superman's origin story into a satisfying horror flick. By the end of that story, Stevo ends up explaining why: \"I didn't sell out. And when Lois finally said it back, was that Gunn's inner punk returning the favor? Gunn truly shocked me with this one and delivered an aspirational superhero movie unlike anything I've seen on the big screen in years."

Because the ship's toilets ran on electricity and therefore couldn't flush, its 4,000 passengers were initially instructed to pee down the drain of their showers on-board (and given biohazard bags to poop in). Everyone assumed the stalled ship would be at sea for only one or two days under these conditions, but the rescue was delayed, and passengers were trapped aboard for four excruciating days. And with no air conditioning on board, passengers were forced to sleep on the decks to avoid the heat and stench below deck. There have been other documentaries about cruise ships that've turned me off of cruising forever: The 2021 HBO film The Last Cruise, about a COVID outbreak on a cruise ship, was certainly one of them. Passenger and crew footage shows ankle-deep rivers of waste cascading down stairwells. Listen, I'm sure there are health and safety measures that need to be met for the Sunrise to set sail, but just knowing what it went through, seeing what I've seen in this film, I'm haunted by the fact that she got a new name and we're just expected to move on.

I knew these would become a favorite the instant I put them on partly because they're easier to put on than the others I tried, but they still provide just as much support. They provided the perfect amount of compression for all activities and I felt comfortable enough to wear them out and about. This is great for pain relief and reduces muscle soreness. These socks come in countless (seriously, there are so many) styles and three sizes. At $30, the Marathon compression socks are hardly a budget buy, but I'd happily pay for a few pairs to get me through a week of work. Who it's best for: I would recommend these socks to runners, nurses and frequent flyers looking for firm compression that stays up all day. These socks are designed to improve circulation and reduce fatigue, making them ideal for athletes and anyone who is on their feet for long hours. Who it's not for: These socks have a tight compression, so they're not ideal for those looking for a softer feel, as these may feel too restrictive. These are also visibly compression socks, so they're not a great option for those looking for a pair that doubles as dress socks."
