The deal, a mix of cash and stock, marks Palo Alto’s entrance into the identity security space, according to a company press release. Palo Alto has been on a shopping spree since Nikesh Arora took over as CEO and chairman of the company in 2018, according to the Financial Times, which estimated the company has spent more than $7 billion on acquisitions since Arora started. The company’s acquisition of CyberArk is the largest to date. Some of Palo Alto’s other acquisitions include: Dig Security, for an estimated $400 million in October 2023; Talon Cyber Security for an estimated $625 million in November 2023; and Bridgecrew for $156 million in February 2021, among others. This is one of the largest cybersecurity deals thus far in 2025. The largest deal was Google’s acquisition of Wiz in March for $32 billion. Palo Alto Networks did not immediately comment."

    "summary": "After largely focusing Google I/O 2025 on the ways the company wants Gemini to change everything from searching the web to filmmaking, Google is finally ready to launch new hardware. The next Made by Google event is on the books for August 20, and Google has already confirmed what at least one of its new Pixel 10 phones will look like.\nGoogle remains as leak-prone as ever, so nearly all the new hardware the company is expected to announce has all ready been reported on in one form or another. With that in mind and after sifting through what has leaked, here's what Google will show off at the Pixel 10 launch even in New York City on August 20.\nPixel 10, 10 Pro, 10 Pro XL and 10 Pro Fold\nAndroid Headlines / Onleaks \nGoogle's invitation for the event says that the company is sharing \"the latest on our Pixel phones, watches, buds and more,” which more or less confirms the company will introduce a slate of products that's similar to what it launched in 2024. That means a Pixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro, Pixel 10 Pro XL and Pixel 10 Pro Fold are absolutely on the menu.\nGoogle's tease of the Pixel 10 confirmed what leaked renders have already signaled: the company isn't abandoning the new design language the Pixel 9 established. The pill-shaped camera bump and flat front display will still be present on the Pixel 10, and the real changes will be in the details, like for example, how the flat sides of the Pixel 10 join with the phone's back.\nThose subtle changes will apparently also include the thickness of the Pixel 10s. While both the Pixel 10, 10 Pro, 10 Pro XL and 10 Pro Fold will use the same sized OLED screens as their Pixel 9 counterparts, they'll be housed in thicker and heavier bodies, according to Android Headlines. Google's new Pixels are also supposed to come in new colors. The Pixel 10 will come in \"Frost\" (a royal blue), \"Lemongrass\" (a yellow), \"Indigo\" (a light purple) and \"Obsidian\" (a dark gray), while the Pixel 10 Pro / Pro XL will come in Obsidian, \"Porcelain\" (off-white), \"Moonstone\" (a bluish gray) and \"Jade\" (a light green). Less information is known about the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, though recent leaks suggest it'll come in Moonstone and Jade, as well.\nAndroid Headlines\nThe most visible external change that'll be introduced on the Pixel 10 is the addition of a new telephoto camera. The new telephoto camera is a 11-megapixel 5x telephoto, Android Authority reports, similar to the one on the Pixel 9 Pro Fold. Meanwhile, the Pixel 10 Pro and 10 Pro XL are expected to feature a 50-megapixel wide, 48-megapixel ultrawide, 48-megapixel telephoto and 48-megapixel selfie cameras. The Pixel 10 Pro Fold could feature a different lineup, with a similar main camera, but 12-megapixel ultrawide and telephoto cameras, and 11-megapixel selfie cameras.\nInside the new phones, Google is laying the groundwork for future performance gains with a new Tensor G5 chip. It's likely be much more power-efficient thanks to the company switching to a 3nm design produced by TSMC. Reports suggest the chip might not be all that different in terms of raw power, but the Tensor G5 is likely designed to be extra capable when it comes to using local AI features.\nWhile global tariff turmoil could justify a price increase, Google is reportedly keeping things consistent with the Pixel 10 family. They'll offer similar storage options, come in at the same prices and include the same freebies and incentives. The Pixel 10 will come with six months of Google AI Pro and Fitbit Premium, along with three months of YouTube Premium. Meanwhile the Pixel 10 Pro models will get a year of Google AI Pro, six months of Fitbit Premium and three months of YouTube Premium. The prices and storage options for the phones should breakout down as follows:\n\nPixel 10: 128GB ($799), 256GB ($899)\nPixel 10 Pro: 128GB ($999), 256GB ($1,099), 512GB ($1,219), 1TB ($1,449)\nPixel 10 Pro XL: 256GB ($1,199), 512GB ($1,319), 1TB ($1,549)\nPixel 10 Pro Fold: 256GB ($1,799), 512GB ($1,919), 1TB ($2,149)\n\nPixel Watch 4\n91mobiles / Onleaks\nThe third time was the charm for the Pixel Watch 3, so the main task Google has with the Pixel Watch 4 is to not squander the solid base it already has. Leaks for the company's new smartwatches have been limited so far, but renders of the Pixel Watch 4 shared by 91mobiles do suggest Google has a few changes planned.\nNamely, much like the company's phones, the new Pixel Watch seems like it'll be a little bit thicker and come with smaller bezels. The Pixel Watch 4 should be available to purchase in the same 41mm and 45mm sizes as before, but in new colors — including a Moonstone option to match the Pixel 10 — and with a brighter display.\nThe thicker frame will also help the smartwatch fit a larger battery and a new wireless charging system, according to Android Headlines. Rather than charge through a puck with pogo pins like the Pixel Watch 3, the Pixel Watch 4 will use a wireless charging stand that could fill it up even faster.\nBeyond that, Google has already indicated how Wear OS is evolving. The new Wear OS 6 update is debuting on the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8, and will presumably be available on the Pixel Watch 4 at launch. It includes built-in access to Gemini, among other tweaks. Given Google also manages the Fitbit Premium subscription, it wouldn't be all that surprising if the Pixel Watch 4 gets some exclusive fitness tracking features, too.\nPixel Buds 2a\nBilly Steele for Engadget\nGoogle launched the Pixel Buds Pro 2 last year, and it typically doesn't update its premium earbuds on a yearly cadence. So instead, Tom's Guide reports Google might pair the Pixel 10 with the Pixel Buds Pro 2 in a new color, and save its new hardware announcements for a sequel to the Pixel Buds A-series called the Pixel Buds 2a.\nUnlike the company's premium wireless earbuds, the A-series Pixel Buds have historically skimped on things like active noise cancellation to hit a lower price. There's little reporting on where Google will take the Pixel Buds 2a, but you can expect the new earbuds to come in some of the new colors being introduced on the Pixel 10.\nPixelsnap\nThe Qi2 wireless charging standard is available for all phone makers to use, but it hasn't been widely adopted among Android phone makers. Qi2 uses magnets to offer improved charging speeds, just like Apple's MagSafe, and the Pixel 10 could mark Google's adoption of Qi2 through a new feature called \"Pixelsnap.\"\nA report from Android Authority suggests the Pixel 10 will include the necessary magnets to make Qi2 happen, and will be introduced alongside a lineup of Pixelsnap accessories. New leaked images showing a Pixel 10 charging with a magnetic charging puck that looks a lot like Apple's MagSafe charger adds even more credence to the rumor.\nIf you need even more convincing, the Wireless Power Consortium has announced that its faster Qi2 25W charging is coming to \"major Android phones.\" It would make sense if Google's Pixel 10s were included considering runs Android itself.\nGemini and other exclusive software features\nGemini is Google's current favorite, and the company is pushing the AI assistant everywhere it makes sense. The last few Pixel Drops — Google's regular Pixel-focused software updates — have primarily included Gemini features. It would make sense for Google to include a few more software exclusives on the Pixel 10.\nGoogle is hosting the Pixel 10 launch event on August 20 at 1PM ET / 10AM ET. The company has invited press to attend in person, and you can read coverage of everything Google announces right here on Engadget.\nUpdate, July 30, 2:30PM ET: Added information on pricing for the Pixel 10 lineup and new details on Qi2 support.\nUpdate, July 24, 3:44PM ET: Added details on the Pixel Watch 4's display, new colors and charging stand.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/google-pixel-10-launch-what-we-expect-to-see-at-the-made-by-google-event-on-august-20-214510537.html?src=rss",

    "full_text": "A new startup called Germ is bringing end-to-end encrypted messaging to the Bluesky social network, allowing its users to have a more secure option for chats than Bluesky’s existing DMs. After over two years of development, the service is launching its encrypted DMs for Bluesky into beta this week, with plans to gradually onboard new testers ahead of a public launch. This allows Germ users to securely chat with friends from Bluesky and the wider open social web, including apps like Flashes and Skylight, but with added controls over the user experience. And that’s really what social media is today,” Brown tells TechCrunch. Xue, meanwhile, came out of Apple believing that the use of phone numbers and telephony is a dated technology to serve as the basis for secure communications and wanted to build something new. Today, Germ’s service works by way of a “magic link,” which is generated for you and pasted into your Bluesky bio. But in Germ’s case, they allow for quick chats. The pairing feature was somewhat finicky in our tests, but we are running the iOS 26 developer beta, which may be causing complications. Image Credits:Germ Network Instagram (opens in a new window) Given that Germ is ahead of the Bluesky team in building encrypted messaging technology, Brown is hopeful that Germ’s protocol could be more broadly adopted by Bluesky and others in the future."

    "full_text": "As part of a roadmap released earlier this year, PUBG developer Krafton said that it would let players create their own modes as part of an alpha, and it revealed more details about the alpha this month. This week, Krafton CFO Dongkeun Bae also discussed the company’s vision for “PUBG 2.0” in an earnings call. The game will also be “a gameplay platform” and Krafton is developing “wide-ranging modes under that objective.” It seems like this approach will be a lot like Fortnite’s, which offers a mix of Epic Games-made modes and user-created experiences. With UGC, if it’s opened up to the broader player base, players will be able to “create many different things” with PUBG. By opening PUBG — which is still one of the most-played titles on Steam — to different kinds of experiences, it could grow beyond just hardcore shooter fans. In some ways, adding user-generated content is a continuation of PUBG and Fortnite following similar tracks. And Epic is investing heavily in its Unreal Engine-level tools for making Fortnite experiences. But like with Roblox and Fortnite, PUBG players may have already invested time and money that makes switching over to a new game that much more difficult. One thing Krafton may also learn from Fortnite: this kind of player-driven expansion can take a long time. Epic has been working and iterating for years to build up Fortnite’s ecosystem of user-made experiences, and even then, Epic’s own modes are usually the ones with the most players."

The company said its customer relationship database was compromised in a social engineering attack, a ploy in which malicious hackers use deception tricks, such as impersonating an employee claiming to have lost their password, to convince helpdesks into granting them access to a system or network. A separate filing with the Massachusetts attorney general’s office also confirmed Social Security numbers were taken in the breach. When reached by email, Allianz Life spokesperson Brett Weinberg said that the company is aware of the types of personal data that was stolen in the breach, but declined to share this information with TechCrunch. The spokesperson said Allianz Life is expected to begin notifying affected individuals by August 1. Allianz Life is the latest insurance company, including Aflac and Erie, in recent weeks to have been breached, as multiple hacking groups known for social engineering attacks ramp up their cyberattacks.

If its age-estimation system decides someone is under 18, YouTube will then: Add safeguards to recommendations, including limiting repetitive views of some content. People who are actually adults but who have been wrongly identified as children will be able to verify that they are 18 or older by using a credit card or a government ID. Hughes of Enough is Enough said that strong measures are needed to protect kids when it comes to their online use of YouTube videos and more. \"This simple step by big tech companies would greatly empower parents, who now must do this themselves on every device and every social media platform, which is overwhelming.\""

    "full_text": "There's a new beta app for iPhones from the founder of Twitter, Jack Dorsey, that helps you track your exposure to the sun. The Sun Day app is free to testers and contains information like sunrise, sunset and UV index in order to assess your potential burn-limit time and, as the app description says, \"track your Vitamin D from the sun.\" Dorsey is currently testing UI updates and a solar noon notification, according to the app notes. Dorsey also recently released Bitchat, a private messaging client that uses Bluetooth as its communication platform. Although it's meant to be a secure, private app, some users have flagged Bitchat for potential security flaws that are still being tested. The effectiveness of an app such as Sun Day depends on giving it accurate information about your skin type and clothing, and while vitamin D levels are one way to gauge UV exposure, it's not foolproof given that some people also take vitamin D supplements. Tracking UV levels is one way to help mitigate those risks. But there is always a risk of sun damage to your skin while you're outside -- year round. \"The app would provide an objective measure of that UV index and guide you in safer sun practices.\" \"I am surprised that they have not involved actual dermatologists in pointing out the true value and limitations of this app,\" she said."

    "summary": "Of all the new iOS 26 features that Apple previewed at WWDC in June, AirPods updates were only briefly mentioned. Studio-quality audio recording and improved call clarity got top billing, while the addition of a camera remote control was also quickly discussed. However, when the beta software arrived last week, it turned out there were actually more features than described at the event, making this a meatier update for Apple’s recent AirPods than initially indicated. I’ve spent some time testing all of the new tools, so here’s what you can expect when you decide to use them.\nHow to get the latest AirPods features\nAll of these updates are available for AirPods that have the H2 chip. Those include AirPods 4, AirPods 4 with ANC and AirPods Pro 2. You’ll have to download the public betas of both iOS 26 and the latest AirPods firmware to use these features. If you’re not feeling adventurous, all of these items will arrive this fall when the final versions of Apple’s OS updates roll out. That’s likely to happen for iOS and AirPods in early September, around the time the new crop of iPhones debuts.\nStudio-quality audio recording\nApple may have framed the voice quality improvements on its AirPods as a boost for creators, but I’d argue the upgrade will be a welcome change for all. Sure, people who create content will benefit considerably from what Apple calls “studio-quality audio recording,” but the improved performance in noisy environments is something anyone will appreciate.\nThe company hasn’t offered much detail on exactly what it did to produce higher-quality audio, only describing the change in an initial press release as the result of a mix of the AirPods’ H2 chip, beamforming microphones and computational audio. That last update is likely doing the heavy lifting here, assisted by Apple’s audio chip, of course. I asked Apple for more specifics, but have yet to hear back.\nImproved audio recording is available across iPhones, iPads and Macs, working in apps like Camera, Voice Memos, Messages (for dictation), Webex and more. Apple also says there’s upgraded vocal sound quality for calls, offering “more natural vocal texture and clarity” for Phone, FaceTime and other CallKit-enabled apps. As the voice upgrades are the most notable new features, I was eager to test them, and have spent the last several weeks doing just that (via the developer beta).\nBilly Steele for Engadget\nIf you’re recording in a quiet room, you’ll notice that enhanced texture and clarity Apple promised. In my samples captured in Voice Memos, there’s not a huge difference between new and old firmware, but there is a noticeable one. The bigger improvement came when I moved to a noisy spot. Here, Apple dialed back its noise suppression in favor of voice clarity. While you’ll hear the slight roar of background noise in my audio clip, I actually sound better overall. That’s a trade I’ll bet many users will gladly make over the highly processed, digital-sounding results AirPods used to give us in less-than-ideal surroundings.\nI also noticed that both of my samples with the new software were captured with a 48kHz sample rate. This isn’t new for AirPods audio recording/quality per se, but before this update some of my clips were still 24kHz — like my noisy sample with the old firmware. It seems like Apple is now defaulting to 48kHz as part of the overall sound boost, but that’s currently unclear and is something else I’ve asked the company for more info about.\nCamera remote\nThe less exciting, but equally handy update for AirPods that Apple announced at WWDC is the addition of a camera remote control. Since newer AirPods have either force sensors or touch controls on their stems, the company saw fit to let you use those to take a photo or start and stop video recording. All of these tasks are done with either one press or a press and hold (you select which one you prefer when you enable the camera remote function).\nFor photos, you get a three-second countdown before your device snaps the picture. This gives you ample time to put your hand down after pressing the AirPods stem so you don’t ruin the selfie. For video, there’s no countdown, but there is a second or two delay before the recording starts. So, if you’re quick about it, you can get your hand away from your ear before showtime. However, you’ll still have to reach for an AirPod or your phone when the time comes to stop recording, so there will be some editing to do there. This all works well, but just remember you have to enable the camera remote feature as it’s not activated by default after the firmware update.\nSleep pausing and CarPlay switching\nBilly Steele/Engadget\nMost AirPods users have probably fallen asleep with one or both of the earbuds in their ears. Apple’s update will add automatic pausing when you’ve dozed off to help you not miss much of your TV show or podcast you were watching or listening to. However, it’s unclear how this works. All we know is it’s a simple on-or-off switch, and it’s disabled by default. Some have speculated that it uses sleep data from the Apple Watch, but that hasn’t been confirmed. Since AirPods have accelerometers, it’s possible the feature may rely on detecting movement, but I’ve asked for a firm answer on what’s going on here.\nAnother item on the list of AirPods updates is automatic switching for CarPlay. This is supposed to seamlessly transfer the audio to your car’s infotainment system from the earbuds when your phone connects to your vehicle. Again, there hasn’t been much discussion of this, and my attempts to trigger it were unsuccessful. That may be due to the fact that it requires wireless CarPlay, but I’m not seeing specific options for this in my AirPods settings. I’m waiting for more info from Apple on this feature too, and hopefully I’ll have more details to add to my observations soon.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/ios-26-updates-for-airpods-preview-enhanced-audio-recording-camera-remote-and-more-173036046.html?src=rss",

Home pizza ovens are on a tear and present an excellent alternative to hot indoor cooking. Minimizing use of the oven and stove can help you avoid heating up your kitchen. Think of summer recipes you can achieve on your countertop, like Instant Pot pork carnitas. If you do end up using your oven or stovetop, make larger quantities than normal. For example, make a whole bunch of pulled chicken in your Instant Pot (which gives off very little heat). Then you can use the leftovers to make tacos, chicken salad nachos and other meals that don't require firing up your oven. That might appear easier said than done, but you could bake bread in the morning, or cook proteins and pasta dishes while you're making breakfast or an early lunch so they'll be ready to go for dinner. Plus, you can keep a fan on in the kitchen to move air around and cool it down. 1 rule for most summer activities, and cooking outdoors or in a warm kitchen is no exception."

After announcing plans to find and restrict underage users on YouTube, the company now says it will start detecting whether Google users based in the US are under 18. Age estimation is rolling out over the next few weeks and will only impact a “small set” of users to start, though Google plans on expanding it more widely. The company says it will use the information a user has searched for or the types of YouTube videos they watch to determine their age. Google first announced this initiative in February. If Google believes that a user is under 18, it will apply the same restrictions it places on users who proactively identify as underage. In addition to enabling bedtime reminders on YouTube and limiting content recommendations, Google will also turn off Timeline in Maps, disable personalized advertising, and block users from accessing apps for adults on the Play Store. In case Google incorrectly identifies someone as under 18, users can submit a photo of their government ID or a selfie to verify their age. The move comes amid a global push for age verification, with politicians in the US pressuring tech companies to make their platforms safer for kids, and the UK widely rolling out an age verification requirement affecting platforms like Bluesky, Reddit, Discord, and even Spotify."

    "full_text": "is a senior reporter who’s been covering and reviewing the latest gadgets and tech since 2006, but has loved all things electronic since he was a kid. If you’re a parent with kids in school or kids who are independently exploring their neighborhood for the first time, then there’s a good chance you’ve considered stashing a tracker somewhere on their person for added peace of mind. Skechers is making that a little easier with a new line of sneakers for kids that feature a hidden compartment in the sole, which is designed to securely hold an Apple AirTag so you can track your child without worrying about the tracker itself going missing. There are currently several different styles and color options in the company’s new Find My Skechers line, with size options ranging from toddlers to eight-year-olds. Lifting the sneaker’s insole and a fabric web liner reveals a plastic compartment recessed into the cushioned midsole that holds and protects an AirTag without inhibiting its wireless communications. You can already find a lot of AirTag accessories that let you attach an AirTag to an active child more securely than just slipping the tracker into their pockets, where it can potentially fall out while they’re playing. Skechers’ solution goes one step further with a lid on the compartment that’s screwed into place. That should help prevent kids from tampering with it and, given the AirTag’s compact size, make it safer for toddlers still experimenting with cramming things into their mouths. As an added safety feature, the shoes don’t feature any branding that hint at there being an AirTag inside them. They look like every other sneaker that Skechers sells, making them one of the more covert ways to keep tabs on where your kids are."

The country's Labor government said that the site will be subject to the same rules as other leading platforms like Facebook, Instagram, TikTok and X when the legislation goes into effect this December.\nAustralia had planned to exempt YouTube from the forthcoming social media ban, on the grounds that it's an educational tool. This irked other platforms, with Meta and TikTok urging the country's government to backtrack on the exclusion.\nThis move didn't sit too well with YouTube and parent company Alphabet. A company spokesperson told CNN that this decision “reverses a clear, public commitment” from the government to treat the platform as an educational tool. YouTube Kids isn't included in the ban because it doesn't allow users to upload videos or comment.\nThe government said this reversal was largely influenced by a survey released by Australia's independent online regulator, the eSafety Commission. It found that 37 percent of children surveyed had reported seeing harmful content on YouTube. This includes stuff like dangerous online challenges, fight videos and hateful rhetoric.\n\nCommunications Minister Anika Wells recently spoke to the Australian Parliament and noted that \"YouTube uses the same persuasive design features as other social media platforms, like infinite scroll, like autoplay and algorithmic feed.\" She went on to say that she accepted the results of the aforementioned survey and that YouTube \"should not be treated differently from other social media platforms.\"\nThe ban originally passed at the tail-end of last year, though some of the details have yet to be ironed out. The government has until December to finalize everything.

    "full_text": "The biggest original film to arrive on Netflix in July was undoubtedly Happy Gilmore 2. The Adam Sandler sequel was 30 years in the making and marks the return of one of his most iconic characters, Happy Gilmore, a Boston Bruins-obsessed hockey fan who turns his mean slapshot into a professional golf career. Happy Gilmore 2 premiered on Netflix on July 25, and features most of the original film's cast. Sandler is joined by Julie Bowen, Christopher McDonald, Dennis Dugan and Ben Stiller, all of whom reprise their roles from the first movie. Sadly, some members of the original 1996 cast, including Bob Barker and Carl Weathers, have died, but new characters played by Bad Bunny, Kym Whitley and Benny Safdie debuted in the sequel. With so much hype around the new release, it makes sense that fans are clamoring to revisit the original, which dropped on Netflix July 1 and is currently in the Netflix Top 10. But you'll have to act fast if you want to watch the comedy classic on Netflix -- that's because Happy Gilmore will no longer be streaming there after July 31. But, when one door closes, another opens, while you may not be able to watch the original on Netflix after this week, the good news is that it'll arrive on Starz on Friday, Aug. 1 so you can catch it there. You'll still be able to rent Happy Gilmore on platforms like Prime Video and Apple TV, too. So if you're gearing up for a Happy Gilmore weekend, fear not, you can still stream both films, as long as you know where to look."

It comes over a year since the showcase for DJI’s very impressive Avinox drive system was launched in Europe, sending shockwaves through the industry and leaving stalwarts like Bosch and Specialized struggling to respond. What’s most impressive about the Avinox system — built around a 1000W Avinox motor capable of producing a very responsive 120Nm of max torque — is how much performance it packs into such a diminutive, lightweight, and efficient package. A remarkable accomplishment for DJI’s inaugural effort. I can’t wait to see what the company best known for its drones has in store for mass-market commuter e-bikes. DJI’s Avinox e-bike drive system includes everything you need to electrify a bicycle. The Amflow PL e-bikes are DJI’s best effort to promote that drive system in a highly-specced and sleek build weighing just 19.2kg. They don’t come cheap, however: the Amflow PL Carbon starts at $7,499 and jumps to $10,199 for the Pro model, so it’d be wise to first book a test ride. If that price is too steep then it might pay to shop around."

    "full_text": "It’s just a taste of the issues that many other countries might face as they launch their own systems, and it’s a situation that privacy and security experts have long warned about — to little avail. “When uploading your ID ... you are handing it over to a third party,” Venzke says. Despite these potential pitfalls, governments are plowing toward the future of an age-gated internet anyway. Age verification was long viewed as unconstitutional in the US, but the Supreme Court overturned that precedent earlier in 2025, concluding “adults have no First Amendment right to avoid age verification” if it’s meant to protect underage users from “obscene” content. Not all age verification efforts entrust users’ privacy to third-party services with a host of different methods. The EU is trialing not only age-gating requirements, but also government-managed digital IDs. Lawmakers and regulators have argued that there are overwhelming benefits to protecting children from harmful content or exploitative social media platforms. “Putting in place commonsense guardrails that protect our kids from the dangers of social media is critical for their future and America’s future,” Sen. Katie Britt said in an announcement about the Kids Off Social Media Act. While keeping kids safe online is important, this messaging downplays or ignores the ripple effects. Until lawmakers stop and think about the bigger picture, everyone’s privacy is going to be at risk."

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman revealed earlier this year that the AI lab is working toward improving ChatGPT’s model picker. In the same post on X, Altman also revealed that GPT-5 will include its o3 model instead of shipping it as a standalone version. This idea of a “magic” model picker has also been used by Microsoft internally. I understand that some parts of Microsoft 365 Copilot have been showing a magic mode in recent weeks that’s designed to function the same as the smart mode. I suspect that this smart mode is showing up in Copilot early because Microsoft engineers are preparing for the release of GPT-5. OpenAI had previously targeted an earlier release of GPT-5, and Microsoft has typically followed up with its own implementation of OpenAI’s models in Copilot quickly after they’re released. Microsoft also quickly launched OpenAI’s o1 reasoning model as part of a Copilot overhaul last year, before making it free to use several months later. Microsoft even made the Sora video generator free to use, months after OpenAI released its paid version.

Soon after dataminers began posting images of Wisdom of Sea and Sky’s cards on Tuesday, Chinese artist lanjiujiu took to their X account with questions about Pokémon TCG Pocket using illustrations that seemed to have been traced from their own work. In particular, lanjiujiu pointed to Wisdom of Sea and Sky’s immersive Ho-Oh card drawn by Sie Nanahara, a Japanese illustrator who has previously produced a number of art pieces for The Pokémon Company. Pokémon TCG Pocket’s original immersive Ho-Oh card bore a number of visual similarities to a piece of art lanjiujiu was commissioned to illustrate in 2021. lanjiujiu did not specify who originally commissioned them, but their art clearly served as the reference for a resin statue sold by PC House Studio, a company that makes unlicensed collectibles. But last night, the company announced that it now plans to update the card as well as Wisdom of Sea and Sky’s immersive Lugia, which also featured the Ho-Oh art as part of a short animation. “We are also conducting a broader investigation to ensure no similar issues exist elsewhere in the game,” TPC said in a statement posted to X. We take this matter very seriously and are committed to strengthening our quality control processes to prevent this from happening again.” Earlier this year, Marvel Snap faced similar accusations on two separate occasions — once regarding a pixel variant M’Baku card that resembled an illustration by fan artist Jason Kiantoro, and another involving a card of the Ancient One that borrowed visual elements from Kamen Rider Wizard. In the latter instance, Marvel Snap simply changed a few details rather than releasing an entirely new card. It’s not clear when Pokémon TCG Pocket will update Wisdom of Sea and Sky’s immersive cards, but if you happen to pull them now, you’ll be greeted with a box that says “new art coming soon.”"

    "full_text": "Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz has activated the state’s National Guard following a cyberattack on the state’s capital, Saint Paul. City officials have not yet disclosed the nature of the cyberattack, but the July 25 breach continues to disrupt city operations and some public services. Saint Paul is one of the largest cities in the U.S., with more than 300,000 residents, and is the latest in a list of major cities targeted by hackers and ransomware gangs in recent years. In a statement on Tuesday, Walz said he authorized the National Guard’s cyber forces at the city’s request to help Saint Paul recover from the cyberattack, saying the “magnitude and complexity” of the breach exceeded the city’s capacity to respond to the incident. The National Guard will help to “ensure continuity of vital services and the safety and security of Saint Paul residents,” Walz said. Saint Paul Mayor Melvin Carter said in a press conference on Tuesday that the city took its government systems offline to contain the intruders, which sparked a citywide Wi-Fi outage. Carter added that the city does not store much data on its residents, but said there was a risk that data on city employees had been stolen."

    "summary": "Mark Zuckerberg has spent the last several months and several billion dollars recruiting prominent AI researchers and executives for a new \"superintelligence\" team at Meta. Now, the Meta CEO has published a lengthy memo that attempts to lay out his big plan for using the company's vast resources to create \"personal superintelligence.\"\nIn the memo, which reads more like a manifesto than a strategic business plan, Zuckerberg explains that he's \"extremely optimistic that superintelligence will help humanity accelerate our pace of progress.\" The technology, according to him, \"has the potential to begin a new era of personal empowerment where people will have greater agency to improve the world in the directions they choose.\"\nZuckerberg, who has previously expressed a desire to build artificial general intelligence, never defines \"superintelligence.\" Nor does the 616-word memo explain how Meta plans to create such a technology, what it might help people accomplish or why anyone should trust the company to build it. Instead, he implies that Meta will be a better steward of this non-specifically powerful AI than \"others in the industry\" who expect \"humanity will live on a dole of its output.\"\nAs profound as the abundance produced by AI may one day be, an even more meaningful impact on our lives will likely come from everyone having a personal superintelligence that helps you achieve your goals, create what you want to see in the world, experience any adventure, be a better friend to those you care about, and grow to become the person you aspire to be.\nMeta's vision is to bring personal superintelligence to everyone. We believe in putting this power in people's hands to direct it towards what they value in their own lives.\nThis is distinct from others in the industry who believe superintelligence should be directed centrally towards automating all valuable work, and then humanity will live on a dole of its output. At Meta, we believe that people pursuing their individual aspirations is how we have always made progress expanding prosperity, science, health, and culture. This will be increasingly important in the future as well. \nLeft unsaid by Zuckerberg, is the fact that the memo comes at a time when he's been rapidly reorganizing Meta's AI teams. Last month, the company invested $14.8 billion into Scale AI, a move that allowed it to bring Scale CEO and founder Alexandr Wang into the company. The 28-year-old founder is now Meta's Chief AI Officer in charge of its superintelligence efforts.\nMeta has also been on a hiring spree for the effort, and has reportedly been offering prominent researchers eight- and nine-figure pay packages to come to Meta. In recent weeks, the company has successfully recruited high-profile talent from Apple and OpenAI, including Shengjia Zhao, who helped created GPT-4. Zhao announced last week that he will take on the role of \"chief scientist of Meta superintelligence labs.\" Just yesterday, Wired reported that Meta has recently turned its recruiting efforts to Thinking Machines Lab, an AI startup founded by former OpenAI CTO Mira Murati, and that in at least one case it made an offer worth more than $1 billion over several years. (Meta PR said some details of that report were \"off.\") All that is on top of the $72 billion Zuckerberg has said Meta plans to spend on AI infrastructure.\nDriving all this is that Zuckerberg has reportedly grown increasingly frustrated by Meta's own generative AI efforts. The company has had to delay its larger \"Behemoth\" Llama 4 model by months. Llama's struggles have also reportedly caused Zuckerberg to question whether Meta's AI efforts should remain open source, according to CNBC.\nIt's also likely no coincidence Zuckerberg's rambling manifesto comes hours before the company is scheduled to report earnings and tell analysts more about its plans to spend billions of dollars on new AI efforts.\nMeta's CEO also clearly sees AI dominance as an opportunity to end the company's reliance on mobile platforms, especially Apple, which he believes have been able to exert too much control via their app stores. In his memo, he explains that \"personal devices like glasses … will become our primary computing devices.\" A future where smart glasses are more important than smartphones would, of course, be extremely convenient for Meta, which has spent the last several years building smart glasses.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/mark-zuckerberg-shares-a-confusing-vision-for-ai-superintelligence-153944322.html?src=rss",

Elon Musk’s Boring Company has announced plans to dig tunnels under Nashville, creating a loop that will connect the city’s downtown with the Nashville International Airport. In 2021, The Boring Company opened its first “loop” in Las Vegas, where it uses a fleet of human-operated Tesla vehicles to transport people across the city’s convention center. Tennessee Governor Bill Lee says the Nashville tunnels will come at “zero cost” to taxpayers, and will instead be “entirely privately funded” by The Boring Company and its partners. Once completed, the “Tesla in tunnels” system will ferry people from the airport to downtown in around eight minutes. Nashville Democratic Representative Justin Jones said he was “denied entry” to an event announcing The Boring Company’s new project, even though other Republicans were allowed to attend, according to local news outlet WKRN. “This project, which requires state approval, is yet another attempt by Bill Lee and his corporate donors to enrich themselves while neglecting public services and real infrastructure needs,” Rep. Jones said in a statement on Instagram. Questions remain about whether this latest loop will actually come to fruition. At the same time, workers at The Boring Company face many safety concerns, with one employee saying they have “consistently flirted with death,” according to a 2024 report by Fortune.

A knife strip won't dull your blades the way some storage types do. Wooden knife blocks are okay for this purpose, but they still create a little more wear and tear than simply mounting them al fresco does. For me, there's also another element to keeping knives sharp that is enabled by the knife strip. Are you concerned about places in your kitchen where bacteria may be hiding?

    "full_text": "The first season of Twisted Metal was almost like a prologue. Season 2 finally rectifies that, and it was definitely worth the wait. After completing his mission in season 1, John Doe (Anthony Mackie) is living inside a relatively safe walled-off city but is forced to train constantly to prepare for the tournament. Most of everyone else has a more selfish desire in mind. While this had me feeling a little like Milhouse, the show does mostly use its time wisely, as it steadily introduces its new cast of combatants. Twisted Metal is a video game series about driving an ice cream truck with machine guns on it, so it’s not exactly well known for its rich, deep characters. That includes a very gross exterminator named Vermin (Lisa Gilroy) and a guy called Mr. Grimm (Richard de Klerk), who may possess supernatural powers or may just be losing his mind. In season 1, it tried to force-feed that goofiness through nonstop jokes from John. And once the tournament really begins — which, long-time fans will appreciate, happens to the tune of Rob Zombie’s “Dragula” — the action is much more over-the-top and exciting, as a show about cars with guns on them should be. Even though I’m only halfway through the season, what’s struck me most is how it finally feels like Twisted Metal, but smartly expanded for this new format."

Apple only advertises its AirTags as products to keep track of items like keys, wallets, or luggage — not human beings. But parents have been using the technology to keep an eye on their kids. Unlike an iPhone with location sharing enabled, AirTags don’t have built-in GPS. Instead, they use Bluetooth beaconing technology to quietly signal their presence to nearby Apple devices, giving the owner of the AirTag an estimate of its location. This technology can still be used for nefarious purposes, however. Bad actors have hidden AirTags in people’s bags or cars to stalk them, which sparked a class action lawsuit. Apple has instituted some anti-stalking features, such as notifying someone via their iPhone or Apple Watch when an unfamiliar AirTag is traveling with them. Since Skechers only makes this product in kids’ sizes, it’s unlikely that these shoes could be used to surveil adults against their will — but the continued normalization of this kind of surveillance could have implications beyond childcare. It’s possible that Skechers or another shoe brand could make similar products designed for adults with conditions like dementia, who may unintentionally wander away from their caretakers."

    "summary": "In just a matter of weeks — if it sticks to its usual schedule — Apple will announce its newest collection of smartphones: the iPhone 17 lineup. And while we got a glimpse of what's to come on the software side of things during last June's WWDC event, we don't yet know what the new iPhones will look like, and what new features they'll offer. However, there have been several leaks and rumors about the hardware side ahead of the phones' official introduction. Here's what we're expecting and what we can reasonably assume we'll get from Cupertino in September.\nWhat are the latest iPhone 17 rumors and reports?\nNot all iPhone rumors are created equal, and all should be taken with a grain of salt. As August comes to a close, we've gotten a glimpse of a purported iPhone 17 \"spotted in the wild.\" \nI just spotted a test development iPhone in the wild 🤩🤩🤩 pic.twitter.com/iS3PtKWqxJ— Fox Pupy 🦊🧡 (@Skyfops) July 28, 2025\n\nThe pics, highlighted on MacRumors, show a black cased iPhone (17?) with the sort of extended top rear \"camera island\" rumored to be coming to the new Pro iPhones. Is it the real deal? The dual angles lend a degree of credibility in a social media landscape increasingly polluted with AI-enhanced fakes, but your guess is as good as ours.  \nBut that's not the only rumor. A \"tipster\" contacted MacRumors to allege three new iPhone Pro camera features: an upgraded telephoto lens with up to 8x optical zoom (up from the current 5x); an all-new pro camera app from Apple for photos and videos; and an additional Camera Control button on the top edge of the phone. That last one seems especially unbelievable, as it would be the third new button added to new iPhones in as many years. Do we really need two dedicated camera keys, in addition to the Action Button? \nWhen will the iPhone 17 series be announced?\nMost years, the flagship smartphones are introduced in September. It's a little early to have the specific dates; some years, Apple only gives a week or two of lead time between sending invites and hosting the event. But years of past precedent show that sometime in September should be when the 17 models make their debut. This family of smartphones may be the last to follow that trend, however. There have been hints that the introduction of the iPhone 18 collection in 2026 will be split into a pro-tier announcement in the fall and a standard model announcement the following spring.\nWhat will the new iPhone 17 lineup include?\nDesign leaks suggest that Apple is building an ultra-thin smartphone, likely to be named the iPhone 17 Air to match Apple's ultralight laptop designation. Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, often a solid source of advanced intel about Apple, reported in January that the iPhone 17 Air will be equipped with a basic A19 chip and will only have a single camera lens. It may also use Apple's new in-house modem, which was introduced in February on the iPhone 16e. More details about this development may leak ahead of September, but that's what we know for now.\nAn investor note from Apple analyst Jeff Pu indicated that the Air will have a titanium frame. If his reports are accurate, the lightweight smartphone will be the only entry in the iPhone 17 lineup to use that metal; the iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone 17 Pro Max are expected to be made of aluminum, which is oddly a lighter material than titanium. Other speculation had suggested that the Air would use a blend of aluminum and titanium, so the exact materials may not be known until the official announcement.\nEach new roster includes a base model, but over the years, Apple shakes up the variety of phones it offers. Most likely there will be an iPhone 17 and an iPhone 17 Pro. Apple has also committed to the size matters philosophy, and has been building an iPhone Pro Max option with an even bigger screen and better battery life; the 17 roster will almost certainly have one as well. \nThe iPhone 17 Air seems primed to take the place of a potential iPhone 17 Plus. Since the iPhone 16e was only just introduced in February at a surprisingly high price point, it seems unlikely that there will be a new addition to that lower end of the spectrum, the models that were previously called SE. \nAt the very least, it sounds like the iPhone 17 Air won't take away the charging port and rely only on wireless connectivity. Bloomberg said that while Apple had investigated making the iPhone 17 Air without a single port, the company (fortunately) changed plans. He also says that the rumored phone will have a 6.6-inch screen and include the Dynamic Island and Camera Control button. Finally, the price is rumored at $900 — likely more than the standard iPhone 17 but less than the Pro.\nWe've also gotten what seems to be a reliable look at what the color lineup will be for the new smartphones. Macworld reported that the iPhone 17 will be available in black, white, steel gray, green, purple and light blue. The iPhone 17 Air will reportedly have four color options: black, white, light blue and light gold. While the Air colors will be less saturated, the visuals for the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max will go bold. The options for the Pro models are expected to be black, white, gray, dark blue and orange.\nWhat will iOS 26 be like?\nApple upended its numbering conventions with WWDC 2025, and will match the name of each new operating system to the year it's released. So when the next wave of iPhones hits, they'll be running on iOS 26.\nOn the design side, the smartphone OS introduced during the big developer showcase took a contentious approach dubbed Liquid Glass. Apple has been scaling down the amount of transparency effects in the subsequent beta tests of iOS 26, but it will still have a glass-like visual.\nThe feature list includes big and small updates. On the more impactful side, the Phone and Photos apps have been redesigned. There will be several features leveraging artificial intelligence, such as live translation capabilities coming to Phone, FaceTime and Messages. Apple is also currently testing a sensitive content warning for child accounts that will freeze FaceTime video if nudity is detected by on-device machine learning tools. And the company is also launching Visual Intelligence, which will use AI to search for elements in an image.\niOS 26 also has a litany of minor, quality of life improvements. Group texts are getting support for polls. And for the slow risers out there, iOS 26 will finally let you escape the tyranny of the nine minute snooze alarm. \nThe next iOS is now available as a public beta. Here are our initial impressions of the Liquid Glass design and other new features. iOS 26 is compatible with all models back through iPhone 11.\nUpdate, July 30, 2025,11:08AM ET: Added latest leaks and rumors about the iPhone 17, and updated information on the iOS 26 public beta.\nUpdate, July 17, 2025, 4:40PM ET: Added latest information about iOS 26, possible materials for the Air, and the color options for the different models.\nUpdate, March 17, 2025, 2PM ET: Added details about the rumored price and features of the iPhone 17 Air.\nUpdate, April 11, 2025, 3:45PM ET: Added details from Front Page Tech's new video that claims to reveal details from a leaked iOS 19 build.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/iphone-17-pro-max-and-air-everything-we-know-about-apples-new-phones-153024282.html?src=rss",

    "full_text": "In his absence, fellow ninja Kenji Muzo stays behind to protect the village. Occasionally, she can take physical form to reach areas Kenji can't access. At full charge, you might get a dozen throws before it empties again. Stages feel repetitive, filled with endless waves of weak enemies that die in one hit. But these fights are the only part of Ragebound that feels like it was designed with care. The regular enemies are mindless and mostly exist to knock you into pits, which cause instant death. With healing talismans and generous checkpoint placement, it's difficult to actually die. The difficulty is also a huge departure from Ninja Gaiden's legacy. You can tweak settings to remove healing items or increase enemy damage, but that's about it. They just run toward you, then pop like water balloons when defeated."

    "summary": "\nThe next season of Apex Legends kicks off on August 5, and it will see the arrival of a new, permanent game mode. Respawn says it built Wildcard as a faster-paced alternative to the core battle royale mode. For instance, when you take out an enemy, they won't leave behind a death box. Instead, their loot will scatter around them, making it easier for you to spot and pick up an item you need or want.\nAnother big difference here is legend stacking. You and your teammates will all be able to play as the same character, if you like. Respawn has retooled the Kings Canyon map for Wildcard, adding ziplines, gravity cannons and other fun stuff to the playground. Second chances will give you another opportunity to pick up the win if things don't pan out for you at first.\nIt's highly likely that Wildcard has been in the works for quite a while, but it's a bit unfortunate for Respawn that it's debuting the mode several weeks after Epic Games added a new, faster-paced battle royale option of its own to Fortnite. Rounds of Blitz Royale — which Epic designed primarily for mobile devices — can last just a few minutes each. Still, it's probably been a couple of years since I last played Apex, and Wildcard has me intrigued enough to dive back in.\nThere are plenty of other updates coming to Apex when the Showdown season starts, of course. Caustic will have a new ability called Field Research, while his gas canisters and grenades will deal more damage. Meanwhile, Bangalore's smoke canister will be able to breach doors and gain an EMP upgrade. In addition, Respawn is retooling the mid-to-late game with powerful passive abilities called Amps. These will allow you to unlock boosts like infinite ammo, extra armor and healing upgrades.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/a-new-faster-paced-game-mode-is-coming-to-apex-legends-on-august-5-150048274.html?src=rss",

But a new analysis from Penn State University’s X-Lab is pouring some cold water on all that good news. Researchers found that Starlink’s satellites can handle just 6.66 households per square mile before service starts to dip below minimum broadband speeds set by the Federal Communication Commission. Starlink has been an absolute game changer in rural areas -- the first truly modern internet connection many Americans have ever had -- but it’s also never been fast enough to meet the FCC’s definition of broadband. According to a report from the speed test site Ookla in June, only 17% of Starlink customers are currently getting 100/20Mbps speeds. (Disclosure: Ookla is owned by the same parent company as CNET, Ziff Davis.) Ookla’s data shows median upload speeds of 14.84Mbps, which is well below the 20Mbps required for BEAD money. But researchers have also documented “latency spikes” caused by handoffs to different satellites as they orbit the Earth. That’s because Starlink is so much better than the internet most rural Americans had before -- if they had it at all -- that they’re more forgiving of the occasional outage or latency spike. SpaceX owner Elon Musk has a long history of saying Starlink improvements are right around the corner."

The machine is thin and light, yet its M4 chip is powerful enough to handle more intense workloads, including 4K video editing, or keeping dozens of tabs open. It can even play games like Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate and Dead Island 2 at respectable frame rates. Having double the amount of memory compared to earlier models will allow you to run more apps simultaneously without slowdown. The entry-level MacBook Air with M4 still starts with 256GB of storage, which can’t be upgraded, so you may want to pick up a configuration with a larger SSD instead if you work with a lot of large files. We don’t expect it to struggle at all during everyday tasks like streaming video, or working on spreadsheets and documents. The processor also yields great battery life, allowing you to get through a day of work or study without reaching for the charger. This is the laptop I use for my work at The Verge, and I’m able to write and go to meetings all day without worrying about the battery dying on me. The MacBook Air’s 12-megapixel webcam is sufficient for video calls with friends or colleagues, and its speakers sound better than you might be expecting for a laptop this size. And if you need a laptop with a larger screen, the 15-inch MacBook Pro with M4 is on sale starting at $999 ($200 off) at Amazon and Best Buy."

Sensor Tower noted that ChatGPT was the leading app for in-app revenue in every country, bar China. Only Google has a better rate for the average number of days used per month. “This development makes its app usage patterns more akin to Google’s, which consumers rely on as a primary search tool both during and outside of work hours,” the report said. The report said that more than a third of prompts used on ChatGPT in Q2 2025 were related to lifestyle and entertainment. Sensor Tower noted that ChatGPT is gaining users across both mobile apps and platforms. It said that more than 15% of ChatGPT users in the U.S. access it across the web and mobile, higher than other platforms like Temu and Threads. Users downloaded apps mentioning AI 7.5 billion times in H1 2025, which accounted for around 10% overall downloads. “Unsurprisingly, apps that added terms like ‘AI’ or ‘LLM’ to their app names or descriptions experienced a notable boost in downloads over the subsequent months,” Sensor Tower said."

In November 2022, YouTube changed its rules so that creators who used swear words in the first 8-15 seconds would potentially be ineligible for any ad revenue. After much backlash, the company changed its rules again in March 2023 so that such videos would be eligible for limited ad revenue, unless they use profanity in the majority of the video. Announcing the latest changes, YouTube’s head of monetization, Conor Kavanagh, said in a video late on Tuesday that the changes of two years ago were made to align YouTube videos with broadcast standards. “We introduced this guideline to align with broadcast standards; advertisers expected ads on YouTube to have a distance between profanity and the ad that just served. Those expectations have changed, and advertisers already have the ability to target content to their desired level of profanity,” he said. He noted that if creators use moderate or strong swear words in the title or thumbnail, their videos might have limited monetization."

Rules that stifle AI companies and the tech's development are unlikely to gain favor in Washington these days, as President Donald Trump's AI Action Plan released this week expressed a desire to regulate this technology less, not more. \"If you go talk to ChatGPT about the most sensitive stuff and then there's a lawsuit or whatever, we could be required to produce that,\" Altman said. For you, the issue isn't so much that OpenAI might have to turn your conversations over in a lawsuit. It's a question of whom you trust with your secrets. \"People should really think about privacy more and just know that almost everything they tell these chatbots is not private,\" Agnew said. \"It will be used in all sorts of ways.\""

Aircraft certified as LSA are limited to flying outside densely populated areas and away from controlled airspace. Still, AIR says its design architecture and cost control give it an edge against the incumbents. “What sets AIR apart is the shared design DNA between both aircraft variants,” Plaut said. “The size and folding-wing mechanism solve a major infrastructure hurdle,” Plaut explained. “And we’re closing the cost gap by applying automotive-grade manufacturing principles for scalable production,” he added."

    "full_text": "Google has confirmed it will sign the European Union’s general purpose AI code of practice, a voluntary framework that aims to help AI developers implement processes and systems to comply with the bloc’s AI Act. Notably, Meta earlier this month said it would not sign the code, calling the EU’s implementation of its AI legislation “overreach” and stating that Europe was “heading down the wrong path on AI.” Google’s commitment comes days before rules for providers of “general-purpose AI models with systemic risk” go into effect on August 2. Companies likely to be affected by these rules include major names such as Anthropic, Google, Meta, and OpenAI, as well as several other large generative models, and they will have two years to comply fully with the AI Act. In a blog post on Wednesday, Kent Walker, president of global affairs at Google, conceded that the final version of the code of practice was better than what the EU proposed initially, but he still noted reservations around the AI Act and the code. “We remain concerned that the AI Act and Code risk slowing Europe’s development and deployment of AI. By signing the EU’s code of practice, AI companies would agree to follow a slate of guidelines, which include providing updated documentation about their AI tools and services; no training AI on pirated content; and complying with requests from content owners to not use their works in their datasets. A risk-based regulation for AI applications, the EU’s landmark AI Act bans some “unacceptable risk” use cases, such as cognitive behavioral manipulation or social scoring. The rules also define a set of “high-risk” uses, including biometrics and facial recognition, and the use of AI in domains like education and employment. The act also requires developers to register AI systems and meet risk- and quality-management obligations."

    "summary": "Earlier this year, Lenovo released a more streamlined and potentially affordable take on its flagship gaming handheld in the Legion Go S. Unfortunately, the Windows 11 version came first, which wasn’t the one we were most excited about. Now, the Legion Go S powered by SteamOS has arrived, and oh my, what a difference an operating system can make. Not only does this model feature a UI that's much better suited for a portable gaming machine, it has faster performance as well. But the best part is that the SteamOS variant is less expensive than its Windows sibling. All of this makes for a handheld that's a welcome alternative to the Steam Deck, especially for anyone who's not a fan of Valve's hardware.\n \nDesign and display: Keeping it simple\nLike its sibling, the SteamOS version of the Legion Go S features a very straightforward design. A big difference between the two is that this model features a dark purple body instead of the white shell on the Windows variant. Thanks to its large 8-inch 1200p display and sizable grips, it's a bit chunkier than rivals like the Steam Deck or the ROG Ally X. At 500 nits, brightness is above average compared to typical handheld PCs. However, because Lenovo uses an LCD panel, colors aren't quite as vibrant and you don't get those pure inky blacks like you do on a system with an OLED screen such as the original Legion Go. \n\n\n\n\n   Sam Rutherford for Engadget \n \n\nI like that Lenovo included Hall effect sensors for its joysticks, along with a toggle that lets you adjust the pull depth of the triggers. Plus, the addition of a second USB-C port allows you to charge the device while keeping other accessories plugged in. There's also a pair of programmable paddles on the back and a handy microSD card slot for expandable storage.\nThe biggest departures from the flagship Legion Go are that this model's joysticks and buttons cannot be detached and its built-in touchpad is significantly smaller. This means the latter is better suited to moving the cursor around SteamOS in desktop mode or to navigating menus than it is as a true alternate control scheme while playing games. You also don't get a fingerprint reader, which I think should be a standard inclusion on handheld gaming PCs at this point.\nPerformance and software: Better with SteamOS\n\n\n\n\n   Sam Rutherford for Engadget \n \n\nThe Legion Go S powered by SteamOS is available in multiple configurations. Our $830 review unit features an AMD Ryzen Z1 Extreme chip with 32GB of RAM and 1TB of storage. Unfortunately, this means I wasn't able to run true apples-to-apples performance tests with the Ryzen Z2 Go-equipped version of the Windows Legion Go S I reviewed earlier this year. But given the lackluster results from that model, I generally wouldn't recommend any handheld powered by that chip, even though that version is significantly more affordable. If budget is a concern, Valve's Steam Deck remains the better option.\nEven though the Go S with SteamOS features the exact same chip, I actually saw slightly better performance here compared to the original Legion Go. With both systems set to a 15-watt TDP (total device power), the Legion Go S edged out the Windows model in Cyberpunk 2077 at 800p on medium graphics by pumping out 58 fps versus 54 fps. By comparison, the Steam Deck OLED managed 53 fps. And in Control at 800p on medium, it was a similar situation, though the gap was even smaller. The Legion Go S hit 29 fps, beating out the OG Legion Go (27 fps) and the Steam Deck OLED (24 fps).\n\n\n\n\n   Sam Rutherford for Engadget \n \n\nThe cause of the SteamOS model's improved horsepower is hard to pinpoint — especially as performance varies from title to title — but it's generally due to Valve's platform having less overhead and system processes than Windows-based rivals. And if that wasn't enough, the SteamOS UI is better designed for a dedicated gaming machine, as turning on the system boots you right into your game library as opposed to spitting you out into Microsoft's classic desktop view. There are also some minor tweaks in Valve's OS to support features like the built-in RGB lighting on the Legion Go S — something the Steam Deck doesn't have.\nFor fans of SteamOS, the main reason aside from price to pick a Steam Deck over the Legion Go S (or vice versa) is that each system features different performance targets. Valve's handheld has a TDP that tops out at 15 watts, and at lower power levels, it features better energy efficiency than the Legion Go S. This makes it more suitable for people who regularly play older games or less demanding 2D fare. Alternatively, Lenovo's handheld has a max TDP of 33 watts (or 40 when plugged into the wall), which makes it more adept at handling resource-intensive modern titles. So if you want higher frame rates (which you probably do), a Z1 Extreme Legion Go S with SteamOS has way more headroom to push pixels even harder. \nBattery life: Just a touch more efficient\n\n\n\n\n   Sam Rutherford for Engadget \n \n\nFeaturing a mid-size 55WHr battery, longevity on the Legion Go S when running SteamOS doesn't really stand out. However, I found that on average, it runs up to 30 minutes longer than its Windows counterpart across a number of titles. When playing Metal Slug Tactics, it lasted just shy of three hours (2:50) compared to closer to an hour and a half for the Windows 11 model (2:33). It was a similar situation in Elden Ring, where the SteamOS version was able to continue for an extra 15 minutes after its sibling conked out.\nWrap-up\nThe Legion Go S powered by SteamOS is a simple and well-built gaming handheld with an even bigger screen than Valve's portable and arguably better ergonomics. When configured with a Ryzen Z1 Extreme chip, it's a better choice for playing more demanding modern games without feeling forced to switch to a Windows-based device. It also has a more optimized UI than its Microsoft-powered rivals while retaining handy features like Hall effect joysticks and dual USB-C ports.\n\n\n\n\n   Sam Rutherford for Engadget \n \n\nWith Z1 Extreme models starting at $830 instead of $600 for the Z2 Go configs, though, it's not quite as affordable as I thought it would be back when it was first announced at the beginning of the year. But even so, it's nice to have options. And as just one of two handhelds on the market that come with SteamOS pre-installed, the Legion Go S makes an interesting argument as a bigger and more powerful upgrade to the Steam Deck.\n\n\n\n\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/legion-go-s-powered-by-steamos-review-a-purpose-built-os-makes-all-the-difference-120059561.html?src=rss",

So, how long can someone go without texting you back before they end up on the friendship chopping block? Repeated offenses can make it tempting to throw in the towel and invest your energy elsewhere. It's no coincidence that some of my closest friends tend to be people with whom I regularly text. There's a sense of familiarity that comes from sharing your day-to-day experiences and thoughts. So, what's an acceptable window of time for someone to text you back? I believe you should always text someone back within a 24-hour period -- notwithstanding special circumstances like travel or illness, etc. Repeatedly taking several days to reply is not only inconsiderate, it also just kills the vibe. Most people have witnessed the awkwardness of someone not replying to your text for days, but ceaselessly posting on social media. While phone calls and in-person meetups are undoubtedly the best ways to have an in-depth conversation with someone, finding a time that works for both parties can be a challenge, given how increasingly hectic our lives have become."

They really can't measure up to the benefits you get from whole-food sources of prebiotics. Brands advertising gut benefits should disclose fiber content prominently, ideally exceeding 4 to 5 grams per serving.\" That prebiotic soda you were thinking about picking up might not work wonders for your gut health. Lee suggests starting with a base of soda water, to which you can add natural flavors. Cuomo says these ingredients will not only flavor your healthy soda but also deliver anti-inflammatory effects. Healthy soda brands' claims might be overhyped, especially when it comes to gut health. While prebiotic drinks can introduce some of these nutrients, they can't compete with whole foods."

Users will be able to read the full note and view a link to its source material.\nWhile TikTok is the latest major platform to adopt the crowd sourced approach to fact checking, unlike Meta, the company is still continuing to work with professional fact checking organizations, including in the United States. The company also points out that Footnotes will be subject to the same content moderation standards as the rest of its platform, and that people can report notes that might break its rules.

    "full_text": "Or, hear me out: Put down your phone and breathe. TikTok’s latest answer to its addictiveness is gamified mindfulness tools. The app’s new Well-being Missions let you earn badges for completing challenges related to balanced digital habits. To be clear, mindfulness and dopamine-seeking mini-games are a contradictory pair. But hey, at least it’s healthier than doomscrolling. The first batch of TikTok’s \"short, engaging missions\" focuses on the platform’s existing digital well-being tools. They include quizzes and flashcards, aspects the company says were well-received in early testing. The idea is to form new habits through encouragement, education and a sense of progress. The gamified challenges are based on research, advice from TikTok’s Youth Council and expert consultations. But come on, now: can’t interfere with profits!"

Regardless of the Frontier Fiber plan you choose, service comes with free equipment rental and unlimited data at no extra cost. That's a pretty good deal considering the Eero Pro 7 sells for $300 and boasts impressive performance. For example, Frontier Fiber has pricing similar to Xfinity's cable internet plans on comparable speed tiers -- both providers offer gigabit service starting at or around $70 per month, for instance -- but you'll get faster upload speeds and unlimited data with Frontier Fiber.

Then you wait to be approved, which people are saying can take days from the influx of new users. The Tea app uses AI to verify your identity and ensure you're a woman. With filters or AI tools, it's not clear how often Tea catches things like that. However, the data breach shows us just how fragile something like this can be. However, there has also been backlash about whether the app violates men's privacy. In the same way that it could be a safe place for women to share information to keep each other safe, it could potentially become a space where misinformation runs rampant and personal information is shared."

You'll find features like the AI Select tool, Audio Eraser and deeper Gemini integration across all of Samsung's S25 devices, as well as a custom Snapdragon 8 Elite processor and 12GB RAM – making the smaller phone of the bunch still seem pretty mighty. And while the Galaxy S25 might look incredibly similar to the S24 and share many of the same specs, consistency isn't so bad when it means there's a consistently good camera and great battery life. Read our full Samsung Galaxy S25 review. Having a baseline phone, like the Galaxy S25, that delivers many of the same perks as more expensive models, is a huge plus in my book. And given the remarkable processing power, standout camera and seamless AI integration in the Galaxy S25 lineup, it's great that I can get all those premium features for $800. If you're someone who insists on buying a flagship device, the Galaxy S25 won't let you down. but if you have a device that's two years old or more, you might be enticed to tap into all the latest Galaxy AI and integrated Gemini features. Now, $800 isn't pocket change, and there are definitely other options for those who want to be more budget conscious, but if you're willing to spend a bit more, the baseline S25 can be a great all-around choice. You probably don't need to upgrade if you're using last year's S24."

Season 2 digs into these themes by reuniting John with his long-lost sister, Dollface. \"He finally has the person who can fill all those empty blanks for him. Up until now, she was basically the only sort of family he had forged. In season 2, we find that John's love interest is still rolling with them.

Here's how to make the Liquid Glass design in iOS 26 more legible. And don't forget, iOS 26 is still in beta. That means the update might be buggy for you, and your device's battery life may be affected, so it's best to keep those troubles off your primary device. If you want to try the beta out, I recommend downloading it on a secondary device. It's also possible that Apple could adjust Liquid Glass, and other update features, before the final version of iOS 26 is released this fall. This will darken any menus or spaces affected by the Liquid Glass design, including in apps like Messages. In the Display & Text Size menu, you can also tap the toggle next to Increase Contrast to help set Liquid Glass elements apart. For more on iOS 26, here are my first impressions of the iOS version and all the new features Apple said it will bring to your device later this year."

For budding creators, it’s a frustration; for those looking to make more professional content, it’s a dealbreaker. Fortunately, the world of mobile-specific (or phone-friendly) microphones has exploded with great options in the last few years. Whether you’ve been tasked with recording candid moments at a relative’s wedding, shooting a friend’s dance moves or are a journalist out in the field traveling light — there’s an option out there that will be perfect for you.We’ve tested a wide range of popular microphones with a mobile focus so that you don’t have to. Below is our hand-picked list of the very best options for a variety of use cases. Some microphones — the wireless lavalier kind, for example — will be more versatile and convenient, useful for a number of different applications. Others, such as our musician or field-recording picks, are where we explore more exotic form factors such as shotgun mics and mobile-friendly desktop options. As always, above everything else is sound quality and general performance. The good news for you is that we’ve done all the hard work for you. Happy recording!\nBest phone mics for 2025: Best wireless mics for creators\n“Creator” is a broad term, but for the purposes of this guide, it’s anyone that wants to make videos or recordings to share on the internet. This is possibly the most exciting category right now with excellent options from brands such as Rode and DJI, but also some compelling budget options too. Once the domain of TV and pro productions, wireless lavalier mics are now the go-to choice for anyone creating in front of (or even behind) the camera.

The claimed range is over 300 feet (100 meters), but in our testing it’s less reliable after about 200 feet (60 meters), but that’s still plenty for most use cases. Ignore the unfamiliar brand name; this mic provides great sound and reliability at a price that’s hard to argue with. James Trew for Engadget Best shotgun mic for most people Rode VideoMic NTG Of all Rode’s numerous shotgun mics, the VideoMic NTG is the one I keep going to when I need something that will get almost any job done. Older iPhones will need a USB-C to Lightning cable, but everyone else can plug right in and start recording. Shure’s companion app also puts handy features such as tone control, reverb and a high pass filter right at your fingertips. It’s a little higher-priced than other USB options, but as a dynamic mic it’s perfect for recording in less than ideal settings such as hotel rooms or cafes. The onboard microphone capsule is perfect for recording both vocals and instruments, and there’s a 3.5mm input so a fellow artist can plug into this to be recorded at the same time. There’s enough onboard storage for a generous 40 hours of 32-bit float recordings, making the Interview Pro completely functional without your phone."

Digital blogger Weibo later said that one of the colors is \"related to the liquid glass design of iOS 26,\" saying it would be white but with different visual effects depending on which light it was in. Apple Intelligence and AI are likely to play more prominent roles with the iPhone 17. There's been plenty of discussion about whether the iPhone 17 Pro will ditch its titanium alloy frame for an aluminum one. What good is a new phone if it doesn't last all day, right?"

    "summary": "Smartwatches do more than just track your steps and deliver phone alerts to your wrist. The best smartwatches go even further, giving you the ability to pay for a cup of coffee, take calls and connect to apps like Spotify all without whipping out your smartphone.Chances are, if you’re reading this, you already know all of the benefits of a smartwatch. You’re ready to invest, or upgrade from an aging accessory, but we wouldn’t blame you if you if you didn’t know where to start. There are dozens of smartwatches available now, including GPS running watches, fitness trackers that look like smartwatches and multi-purpose devices. Plus, you’ll want to consider factors like durability, battery life and operating system before you spend a lot of money on a new wearable. We’ve tested and reviewed most major smartwatches available today and these are our top picks.\nTable of contents\n\nBest smartwatches for 2025\nStylish smartwatches: Fossil and more\nFactors to consider before buying a smartwatch\nOther smartwatches our experts tested\nSmartwatch FAQs\n\nBest smartwatches of 2025\n \n \n \n \n \nStylish smartwatches: Fossil and more\n\n\n\n\n   Fossil \n \n\nYes, there are still companies out there trying to make “fashionable” hybrid smartwatches. Back when wearables were novel and generally ugly, brands like Fossil, Michael Kors and Skagen found their niche in stylish smartwatches that took cues from analog timepieces. You also have the option to pick up a “hybrid” smartwatch from companies like Withings and Garmin – these devices look like classic wrist watches but incorporate some limited functionality like activity tracking and heart rate monitoring. They remain good options if you prefer that look, but thankfully, wearables made by Apple, Samsung, Fitbit and others have gotten much more attractive over the past few years. \nUltimately, the only thing you can’t change after you buy a smartwatch is its case design. If you’re not into the Apple Watch’s squared-off corners, all of Samsung’s smartwatches have round cases that look a little more like a traditional watch. Most wearables are offered in a choice of colors and you can pay extra for premium materials like stainless steel for extra durability. Once you decide on a case, your band options are endless – there are dozens of first- and third-party watch straps available for most major smartwatches, and for both larger and smaller wrists, allowing you to change up your look whenever you please.\nFactors to consider before buying a smartwatch\nCompatibility\nApple Watches only work with iPhones, while Wear OS devices play nice with both iOS and Android phones. Smartwatches made by Samsung, Garmin, Fitbit and others are also compatible with Android and iOS, but you’ll need to install a companion app on your smartphone.\nThe smartwatch OS will also dictate the type and number of third-party apps you’ll have access to. Many of these aren’t useful, though, making this factor a fairly minor one in the grand scheme of things.\nPrice\nThe best smartwatches generally cost between $300 and $400. Compared to budget smartwatches, which cost between $100 and $250, these pricier devices have advanced operating systems, communications, music and fitness features. They also often include perks like onboard GPS tracking, music storage and NFC, AMOLED displays, and long battery life, things that budget devices generally don’t have.\nSome companies make specialized fitness watches: Those can easily run north of $500, and we’d only recommend them to serious athletes. Luxury smartwatches from brands like TAG Heuer and Hublot can also reach sky-high prices, but we wouldn’t endorse any of them. These devices can cost more than $1,000, and you’re usually paying for little more than a brand name and some needlessly exotic selection of build materials.\nBattery life\nBattery life remains one of our biggest complaints about smartwatches, but there’s hope as of late. You can expect two full days from Apple Watches and most Wear OS devices. Watches using the Snapdragon Wear 3100 processor support extended battery modes that promise up to five days of battery life on a charge — if you’re willing to shut off most features aside from, you know, displaying the time. Other models can last five to seven days, but they usually have fewer features and lower-quality displays. Meanwhile, some fitness watches can last weeks on a single charge. If long battery life is a priority for you, it’s worth checking out the watch’s specs beforehand to see what the manufacturer estimates.\nCommunication\nAny smartwatch worth considering delivers call, text and app notifications to your wrist. Call and text alerts are self explanatory, but if those mean a lot to you, consider a watch with LTE. They’re more expensive than their WiFi-only counterparts, but cellular connectivity allows the smartwatch to take and receive phone calls, and do the same with text messages, without your device nearby. As far as app alerts go, getting them delivered to your wrist will let you glance down to the watch face and see if you absolutely need to check your phone right now.\nFitness tracking\nActivity tracking is a big reason why people turn to smartwatches. An all-purpose timepiece should function as a fitness tracker, logging your steps, calories and workouts, and most of today’s wearables have a heart rate monitor as well.\nMany smartwatches' fitness features include a built-in GPS, which is useful for tracking distance for runs and bike rides. Swimmers will want something water resistant, and thankfully most all-purpose devices now can withstand at least a dunk in the pool. Some smartwatches from companies like Garmin are more fitness focused than others and tend to offer more advanced features like heart-rate-variance tracking, recovery time estimation, onboard maps and more.\nHealth tracking on smartwatches has also seen advances over the years. Both Apple and Fitbit devices can estimate blood oxygen levels and measure ECGs. But the more affordable the smartwatch, the less likely it is that it has these kinds of advanced health tracking features; if collecting those kinds of wellness metrics is important to you, you’ll have to pay for the privilege.\nMusic\nYour watch can not only track your morning runs but also play music while you’re exercising. Many smartwatches let you save your music locally, so you can connect wireless earbuds via Bluetooth and listen to tunes without bringing your phone. Those that don’t have onboard storage for music usually have on-watch music controls, so you can control playback without whipping out your phone. And if your watch has LTE, local saving isn’t required — you’ll be able to stream music directly from the watch to your paired earbuds.\nDisplays\nMost wearables have touchscreens and we recommend getting one that has a full-color touchscreen. Some flagships like the Apple Watch have LTPO displays, which stands for low-temperature polycrystalline oxide. These panels have faster response times and are more power efficient, resulting in a smoother experience when one interacts with the touchscreen and, in some cases, longer battery lives.\nYou won’t see significant gains with the latter, though, because the extra battery essentially gets used up when these devices have always-on displays, as most flagship wearables do today. Some smartwatches have this feature on by default while others let you enable it via tweaked settings. This smart feature allows you to glance down at your watch to check the time, health stats or any other information you’ve set it to show on its watchface without lifting your wrist. This will no doubt affect your device’s battery life, but thankfully most always-on modes dim the display’s brightness so it’s not running at its peak unnecessarily. Cheaper devices won’t have this feature; instead, their touchscreens will automatically turn off to conserve battery life and you’ll have to intentionally check your watch to turn on the display again.\nNFC\nMany new smartwatches have NFC, letting you pay for things without your wallet using contactless payments. After saving your credit or debit card information, you can hold your smartwatch up to an NFC reader to pay for a cup of coffee on your way home from a run. Keep in mind that different watches use different payment systems: Apple Watches use Apple Pay, Wear OS devices use Google Pay, Samsung devices use Samsung Pay and so forth.\nApple Pay is one of the most popular NFC payment systems, with support for multiple banks and credit cards in 72 different countries, while Samsung and Google Pay work in fewer regions. It’s also important to note that both NFC payment support varies by device as well for both Samsung and Google’s systems.\nOther smartwatches our experts tested\nApple Watch Ultra 2\nThe Apple Watch Ultra 2 is probably overkill for most people, but it has a ton of extra features like extra waterproofing to track diving, an even more accurate GPS and the biggest battery of any Apple Watch to date. Apple designed it for the most rugged among us, but for your average person, it likely has more features than they'd ever need. If you’re particularly clumsy, however, its high level of durability could be a great reason to consider the Apple Watch Ultra 2.\nApple Watch SE\nThe Apple Watch SE is less feature-rich than the flagship model, but it will probably suffice for most people. We actually regard the Watch SE as the best smartwatch option for first-time buyers, or people on stricter budgets. You’ll get all the core Apple Watch features as well as things like fall and crash detection, noise monitoring and Emergency SOS, but you’ll have to do without more advanced hardware perks like an always-on display, a blood oxygen sensor, an ECG monitor and a skin temperature sensor.\nGarmin Forerunner 745\nGarmin watches in general can be great options for the most active among us. The Garmin Forerunner 745 is an excellent GPS running watch for serious athletes or those who prize battery life above all else. When we tested it, we found it to provide accurate distance tracking, a killer 16-hour battery life with GPS turned on (up to seven days without it) and support for onboard music storage and Garmin Pay.\nAmazfit Bip 6\nThe Amazfit Bip 6, an $80 smartwatch from Zepp Health, didn’t quite make the cut. As a fitness tracker, it’s decent, but it’s a frustrating smartwatch. For workouts, the built-in GPS tracks runs and rides without your phone and, combined with the heart rate and blood oxygen sensors, collects a good amount of data to create accurate pictures of your exertion levels, cadence and pace. It’s remarkably lightweight but doesn’t feel cheap and the AMOLED screen is bright and sharp. It’s not an always-on display, but lifting your wrist wakes it reliably.\nThe sleep tracking data is on par with what we measured on other smartwatches and there’s even a daily readiness score that compares your sleep quality and the previous day’s exertion to estimate how physically prepared you are for the day ahead — similar to what Pixel Watches, Fitbit devices and Garmin watches offer. And since the watch battery lasts for over a week on a charge, you may be a lot more apt to wear it to bed than a watch you have to charge daily.\nWe weren’t expecting an $80 device to be a serious Apple Watch challenger, but the Bip 6’s glitches and overly complicated interface (both on the app and on the watch itself) were disappointing. During a week of testing, I got multiple repeated notifications, even after they were deleted, along with suggestions to stand when I was actively doing chores around the house. The watch faces are not customizable, so it was hard to get the info I needed at a glance (the Zepp app has lots of paid watch faces that may have what I wanted, but I didn’t want to pay $3 for something that’s free elsewhere).\nMarketing details state that the Bip 6 can auto-detect workouts, including walking and bike riding. During testing, I walked once or twice per day for over one mile and went on two bike rides, but no workout was ever detected. The watch integrates with Apple Health, so I was able to see how it compares to the data my Apple Watch gathers. After a week of wearing the Bip 6, with no changes to my daily routine, I averaged 400 fewer calories burned and 2.4 fewer miles tracked each day. That was possibly the biggest disappointment of all. — Amy Skorheim, Senior Reporter\nSmartwatch FAQs\nIs there a difference between a smartwatch and a fitness tracker?\nWhile smartwatches and fitness trackers share some similarities, they’re designed for slightly different purposes.\nA fitness tracker is primarily focused on health and activity tracking. It keeps tabs on your steps, heart rate, sleep and workouts, and some even offer advanced metrics like blood oxygen levels and stress tracking. Fitness trackers are generally more compact, have longer battery life and are built with activity in mind.\nA smartwatch, on the other hand, is like a mini smartphone on your wrist. It offers fitness tracking features, but also lets you do things like reply to texts, take calls, use apps and control smart home devices. Many smartwatches support voice assistants, mobile payments and even LTE connectivity, so you can leave your phone behind in some cases.\nIf you mainly want health and activity tracking with long battery life, a fitness tracker is the way to go. If you want a more connected experience with extra features, a smartwatch is the better choice.\nHow long do smartwatches last?\nHow long a smartwatch lasts mostly depends on two things: battery life and overall durability.\nSmartwatch battery life varies a lot depending on the brand, features and how you use it. Basic models with e-ink displays or monochrome screens can last a week or more, while full-featured smartwatches like the Apple Watch or Samsung Galaxy Watch usually need a charge every day or two. If you're using features like always-on display, GPS tracking or LTE connectivity, expect the battery to drain faster.\nPhysically, a good smartwatch should last several years before you need to upgrade. Premium models with scratch-resistant glass, water resistance and strong build materials tend to hold up well over time. However, software support matters too — brands like Apple and Samsung typically provide updates for at least a few years, while some budget smartwatches may not get long-term software support.\nYou can expect to charge most smartwatches daily or every few days, and if you take care of them, they should last 3-5 years before an upgrade is necessary.\nHow much should you spend on a smartwatch?\nHow much you should spend on a smartwatch depends on what features you need and how often you plan to use it.\nIf you just want the basics — step tracking, notifications, heart rate monitoring and basic fitness tracking — you can find some solid budget-friendly options from brands like Amazfit, Fitbit and some Wear OS models. These usually have decent battery life but may lack premium features like LTE, advanced health tracking or third-party apps.\nIn the mid-range smartwatch price bracket, you’ll find popular models like the Apple Watch SE and Fitbit Versa series. These offer a good mix of fitness tracking, smart features and design quality. You’ll get better build materials, more accurate sensors and app support, but battery life might still be limited to a day or two.\nHigh-end smartwatches like the Apple Watch Ultra, Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra and Garmin Fenix/Epix series offer advanced health tracking, rugged designs, LTE connectivity and longer software support. These are great for serious athletes, outdoor adventurers, or anyone who wants the latest and greatest features.\nIf you just want a simple smartwatch for notifications and fitness tracking, a budget or mid-range model will do the job. But if you want a premium feel, advanced health tracking or LTE connectivity, it’s worth spending a bit more. For most people, $200 - $350 hits the best balance of features and value.\nDo all smartwatches have GPS?\nNot all smartwatches have built-in GPS. Some rely on your phone’s GPS, while others have it built-in for independent tracking.\nHigh-end and fitness-focused smartwatches, like the Apple Watch, Samsung Galaxy Watch and Garmin models have their own built-in GPS. This means they can track your runs, walks, bike rides and hikes without needing to be connected to your phone. It’s a must-have for serious athletes or anyone who wants accurate location tracking without carrying a phone.\nSome budget and mid-range smartwatches (like some Fitbit and Amazfit models) don’t have built-in GPS but can use your phone’s GPS when connected via Bluetooth. This works fine if you usually carry your phone while working out, but it’s less convenient if you prefer to leave it behind.\nSome very basic or budget smartwatches skip GPS entirely and rely solely on step tracking or motion sensors. These are fine for casual users who don’t need location tracking.\nCan you leave your phone at home and still use a smartwatch?\nYes, but it depends on the smartwatch and what you want to do without your phone.\nIf your smartwatch has LTE or cellular connectivity , you can make calls, send texts, stream music, use maps and even access apps without your phone nearby. However, you’ll need a separate data plan from your carrier, which usually comes with an extra monthly cost.\nEven without LTE, some smartwatches can still do plenty on their own, including track workouts and GPS routes (if they have built-in GPS), play music offline (if they support downloads from Spotify or Apple Music), may contactless payments with features like Apple Pay and Google Wallet and control smart home devices.\nIf going phone-free is important to you, look for a smartwatch with LTE and built-in GPS for the best experience.\nCan a smartwatch make calls without a phone?\nYes, a smartwatch can make calls without a phone — but only if it has the right features.\nSome smartwatches have built-in LTE connectivity, meaning they can work independently from your phone. You can make and receive calls, send texts, stream music and use apps as long as you have a mobile data plan for the watch. However, you’ll need to pay for a separate cellular plan and battery life drains faster when using LTE.\nIf your smartwatch doesn’t have LTE, it can still make calls, but only when connected to your phone via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi. It essentially acts as a remote speaker and microphone for your phone’s calls. Watches like the standard Apple Watch or Samsung Galaxy Watch (Wi-Fi versions) can do this. However, if your phone isn’t nearby or connected to Wi-Fi, calling won’t work.\nSome fitness-focused smartwatches (like certain Garmin, Fitbit and Amazfit models) don’t have a built-in speaker or microphone, so they can’t make or receive calls at all — only show notifications.\nIf calling without a phone is a must, make sure to choose an LTE model with a built-in mic and speaker.\nWhat's the difference between an Android and Apple smartwatch?\nThe biggest difference between Android and Apple smartwatches comes down to compatibility, features and ecosystem integration.\nApple smartwatches (Apple Watch) only work with iPhones. If you have an Android phone, you can’t use an Apple Watch at all. Android smartwatches (Wear OS, Samsung Galaxy, Garmin etc.) mostly work with Android phones, but some also support iPhones with limited features. If you have an iPhone, the Apple Watch is the best choice. If you have an Android phone, go for a Wear OS or Samsung Galaxy Watch.\nApple Watch (watchOS) has the best app support with seamless integration into Apple’s ecosystem (iMessage, FaceTime, Apple Pay, Apple Fitness+, Siri etc.). Android smartwatches offer more variety, with access to Google services (Google Assistant, Google Wallet and Google Maps), and some support Amazon Alexa or Samsung’s Bixby.\nIn terms of design, Apple Watch has a single design but comes in different sizes and materials. It’s sleek, but your only real customization comes from bands and watch faces. Android smartwatches, on the other hand, come in tons of styles and brands (Samsung, Google Pixel Watch, Garmin, Fossil etc.), meaning you can pick a round watch, a rugged design or a luxury-looking model.\nIf battery life is important to you, the Apple Watch lasts about a day or two per charge, depending on usage and model. Many Android smartwatches (especially Garmin, Amazfit or Mobvoi TicWatch) last multiple days or even weeks on a single charge.\nGeorgie Peru contributed to this report.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wearables/best-smartwatches-153013118.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "NotebookLM, the Google research tool that gained notoriety for its AI-generated podcasts, is introducing a feature called Video Overviews. As the name suggests, this tool automatically creates videos on requested topics and pulls data from a user's uploaded images, diagrams, quotes and documents.\nIt's rolling out right now, but there are some caveats. These overviews are only available in English, though Google says more languages are on the way. Also, the tool doesn't make videos in a conventional sense. It creates slideshows with narration.\n\nDespite this limitation, the company says the feature is \"uniquely effective for explaining data, demonstrating processes and making abstract concepts more tangible.\" Google also says it'll be expanding the toolset in the future, so it won't always be just a slideshow machine.\nVideo Overviews do currently offer some handy playback options. There's the ability to skip back and forth by 10 seconds and adjust the playback speed. The company is also updating NotebookLM's Studio tab. It's getting a visual refresh, which rolls out \"over the next few weeks\" to all users.\nGoogle has certainly been busy iterating on the platform these past few months. It released an official NotebookLM app back in May and began offering curated \"featured notebooks\" earlier this month. This lets users experiment with the platform with pre-approved topics like William Shakespeare, so newbies won't have to actually upload anything. Audio-only overviews are also now available in over 50 languages. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/google-adds-video-overviews-to-notebooklm-181524866.html?src=rss",

Conversations then unfold using a \"scaffold\" structure, which means ChatGPT will slowly roll out information so as not to overwhelm the user with more information than they're ready to digest.\nOpenAI says it developed Study Mode in collaboration with teachers, scientists and pedagogy experts. Rather than running on an entirely new model, the tool is powered by a series of custom system instructions.\n\"We chose this approach because it lets us quickly learn from real student feedback and improve the experience — even if it results in some inconsistent behavior and mistakes across conversations,\" said OpenAI. \"We plan on training this behavior directly into our main models once we’ve learned what works best through iteration and student feedback.\"\nNotably, OpenAI isn't making Study Mode available only to ChatGPT Edu users. Instead, the company is first rolling out the feature to logged in Free, Plus, Pro and Team users. Edu subscribers will gain access in the \"next few weeks.\" \nIt will be interesting to find out how many students end up actually using Study Mode, as a toggle allows you to easily turn the feature on and off. And as a recent New York Magazine article vividly detailed, AI cheating is a major problem at US colleges. For its part, OpenAI says it plans to work on making Study Mode more engaging and useful to students. The company is exploring how to offer deeper personalization through the tool, as well as ways to offer goal setting and progress tracking across conversations.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/chatgpts-study-mode-will-guide-students-to-an-answer-stey-by-step-180614172.html?src=rss",

Meet the $279 animatronic Ultra Skelly.\nGiven its name, you might think Ultra Skelly is even bigger than the standard 12-ft. model. But the new model is only 6.5 ft. tall. The \"Ultra\" part comes from app control and animatronic movements. \nThe app lets you control its head, torso and arm movements. It includes five pre-loaded voice phrases. But the real fun comes in recording your own or speaking live through the app. (It includes voice-altering effects.) Your recordings can be up to 30 seconds long.\n\n\n\n\n   Home Depot \n \n\nIt also has the famously creepy LED eyes that made the original a viral hit. (You can choose from 18 eyes in the app). Its chest and mouth have lights, too. Ultra Skelly's fingers are posable but not animated. Home Depot says it takes around 45 minutes to assemble.\nThe OG 12-ft. Skelly is returning, too, for $299. And like any centerpiece of an expanding franchise, he now has an entourage. The (standing, 7-ft.) Skelly's Dog is back for $199. It's joined by the new (5-ft.) Skelly's Sitting Dog for $249 and the (5-ft.) Skelly's Cat for $199.\nYou can order Home Depot's Halloween collection from its website on August 4. Skelly has sold out quickly in the past.

In the coming weeks, the company is also adding support for PDF uploads on desktop, which could help you digest lengthy course or work materials. You can ask AI Mode to summarize the documents for you and ask follow-up questions that it will then answer by cross-referencing the materials you uploaded with information available on the web. Google says AI Mode's responses will also include links to its references that you can visit in order to dig deeper. AI Mode will support additional file types for upload, including ones straight from your Google Drive, in the coming months as well. \nIn addition to PDF upload support, Google is also rolling out a new Canvas feature that you can access if you're enrolled in the AI Mode Labs experiment in the US. You can use Canvas to consolidate all relevant information about a specific topic or for a specific purpose in a side panel that updates as you ask AI Mode more follow-up questions. If you're traveling, for instance, you can ask AI Mode to make you an itinerary and click the Create Canvas button. You'll be able to keep refining the itinerary with more questions, and you can always leave it alone for a while and come back to it later. \nAI Mode's Search Live is also getting video input on mobile this week, a feature Google announced at I/O 2025, after voice input arrived in June. To be able to access video input, you'll have to open Lens in the Google app and tap the Live icon before asking questions on what the camera sees. When Google revealed the feature during its annual developers' event, it said you could point the camera at a math problem, for example, and ask Search to help you solve it or to explain a concept you're having trouble understanding. \nFinally, with Lens in Chrome, you'll be able to ask AI Mode what's on your desktop screen. The company will roll out an \"Ask Google about this page\" dropdown option in the address bar \"soon.\" When you click on it, AI Mode will create an overview with key information on what's being shown on your screen, whether it's a web page or a PDF. \nUpdate, July 29 2025, 12:29PM ET: This story has been updated, as Google shared after the article was published that the image and PDF upload features will be available wherever AI Mode is available, not just in the US. That means those uploads will come to the US, India and the UK.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/google-is-bringing-image-and-pdf-uploads-to-ai-mode-160050646.html?src=rss",

AI Mode will support additional file types for upload, including ones straight from your Google Drive, in the coming months as well. You'll be able to keep refining the itinerary with more questions, and you can always leave it alone for a while and come back to it later. AI Mode's Search Live is also getting video input on mobile this week, a feature Google announced at I/O 2025, after voice input arrived in June. When Google revealed the feature during its annual developers' event, it said you could point the camera at a math problem, for example, and ask Search to help you solve it or to explain a concept you're having trouble understanding. Finally, with Lens in Chrome, you'll be able to ask AI Mode what's on your desktop screen. The company will roll out an \"Ask Google about this page\" dropdown option in the address bar \"soon.\" When you click on it, AI Mode will create an overview with key information on what's being shown on your screen, whether it's a web page or a PDF."

    "summary": "Sex toy company Lovense is leaking the email addresses of its app users and allowing account takeovers without asking for a password, according to a security researcher. As reported by TechCrunch, BobDaHacker, who describes themself as an ethical hacker committed to exposing and reporting security vulnerabilities, published an extensive report in which they accuse Lovense of failing to fix a serious bug it was first made aware of in 2023.\nAccording to the hacker (and later verified by TechCrunch), Lovense allows any username to be turned into their email address with the right know-how, a flaw they initially discovered after muting someone on the app. With their access to Lovense’s API, they were able to obtain the emails associated with any public username in less than a second when running the modified request process through an automated script. They noted that the vulnerable nature of these accounts is \"especially bad for cam models\" who use the Lovense platform for work, and may share their usernames for these purposes.\nThe researcher also realized that with a user’s email address (either one you already know or one obtained using the aforementioned disclosure bug), they could generate auth tokens that allowed them to take over the associated account without a password. This allegedly worked for the Lovense Chrome Extension and Lovense Connect app, as well as the company’s Cam101 and StreamMaster software — and even admin accounts.\nBobDaHacker said they initially reported the bugs to Lovense with assistance from the sex tech hacking project The Internet Of Dongs in March 2025, and received $3,000 in total for flagging them via the HackerOne security platform. After a series of interactions with Lovense representatives, they were told in early June that the account takeover bug had been fixed during the previous month, which the researcher claims is not true. Regarding the email disclosure flaw, Lovense said in a statement printed by BobDaHacker that it could take up to 14 months to fix the issue, as a faster one-month fix would \"require forcing all users to upgrade immediately,\" which it said would \"disrupt support for legacy versions.\"\nThe researcher went on to say that they were contacted by a Twitter user who claimed to have found the same account takeover bug as far back as 2023, and were told shortly after reporting it to Lovense that the bug had been resolved, which wasn’t the case. They said a patch eventually fixed their method, which used an HTTP endpoint to convert a username into an email address, but that it wasn’t rolled out until early 2025. BobDaHacker said they had requested comment from Lovense but at the time of writing had not received one.\nThis isn’t the first time Lovense users have stumbled upon privacy concern bugs. In 2017, a Redditor discovered that the Lovense app, which allows users to control their sex toys remotely, was recording audio without their consent and saving it to their phone. A commenter on the Reddit post, who claimed to be a Lovense representative, called the recordings a \"minor software bug\" that affected the Android version of the app and said at the time that it had been fixed in an update.\nUpdated 7/30/25 7:51 AM ET:  In a statement to BleepingComputer, Lovense said that a fix is rolling out in the app stores: \"The full update is expected to be pushed to all users within the next week. Once all users have updated to the new version and we disable older versions, this issue will be completely resolved.\"\nThe company's spokesperson stated that the exposed email addresses flaw was fixed at the end of June, although BobDaHacker says this issue still remains.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/a-lovense-security-flaw-may-be-letting-people-take-over-accounts-without-a-password-160528730.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "If you're at all familiar with Meta's Ray-Ban-branded smart glasses, there won't be many surprises when it comes to its latest Oakley frames. The Oakley Meta glasses rely heavily on what's already been a successful playbook for the company: the style of a popular eyewear brand mixed with juuust enough tech to let you keep your phone in your pocket a little longer.\nBut the Oakley Meta glasses are also the social media company's first collaboration with a non-Ray-Ban brand (though both share a parent company in EssilorLuxottica). And while Meta stays pretty close to the strategy it's used for the last four years, its latest frames offer some hints about its longterm ambitions in the space. \nMeta has described its Oakley-branded frames as \"performance glasses,\" which isn't entirely surprising given Oakley's longtime association with athletes. But there are only a few actual upgrades compared to the Ray-Ban lineup. The Oakley Meta glasses have a notably longer battery life, both for the glasses themselves and the charging case. They are also able to capture higher quality video than previous versions.\nWith a starting price of nearly $400, though, I'm not sure those upgrades are worth an extra $100 - $200.\n \nWhy do they look like that?\nMeta's debut pair of Oakley-branded glasses are based on the brand's HSTN (pronounced how-stuhn) frames and there's really nothing subtle about the design. The first of these is a limited edition version with shiny gold lenses and bright white frames (which Meta inexplicably calls \"warm grey\").\nLike previous Ray-Ban models, they don't look overtly techy, but I still wasn't a big fan of the design. The glasses felt just a little oversized for my face and something about the bright white paired with gold lenses reminded me a little too much of a bug. The color combo also accentuates just how thick the frames are, particularly around the awkwardly wide nosepiece.\n\n\n\n\n   Karissa Bell for Engadget \n \n\nI posted a selfie on my Instagram Story and polled my friends on what they thought. And while a few politely said they thought I was \"pulling them off,\" the majority said they looked too big for my face. A few told me they looked straight-up weird, and one summed up my feelings pretty well with \"something looks off about them.\" Style is subjective, of course. And depending on your face shape and tolerance for contrasting colors, I could see others enjoying the design. I'm looking forward to seeing the rest of the HSTN collection, which is coming later this summer, and will hopefully have some more flattering color variations.\nLooks aside, the glasses function almost identically to the Ray-Ban glasses Meta introduced in 2023. There's a 12-megapixel POV camera over the left eye, and an indicator light over the right that lights up when you snap a photo or start recording a video via the capture button. There are open-ear speakers in the arms so you can listen to music and hear notifications. Much like the Ray-Ban glasses, the speakers here are pretty good at containing the sound so others can't hear when you're listening at lower volumes, but it's definitely noticeable at higher levels. You can control music playback and volume pretty easily, though, with a touchpad on the right side of the glasses.\n\"Performance\" upgrades\nThe most important upgrade that comes with the Oakley glasses is the battery. Meta claims the glasses can last up to eight hours with \"typical\" (non-constant) use and up to 19 on standby. I was able to squeeze a little over five hours of continuous music playback out of the battery in one sitting, which is about an hour better than the Ray-Ban frames. The charging case can provide up to 48 hours of additional runtime, according to Meta. It's been well over a week and I haven't yet had to plug in the case.\nThe charging case is, however, noticeably bigger and heavier than the Ray-Ban case. It's not a dealbreaker, but the case is too big for any of my pockets and just barely fits into my small sling bag. My other gripe with the charging case is the same complaint I had about the Ray-Ban case: there's no way to see the charge level of the case itself. There's a small LED in the front that will change from green to yellow to red based on the battery level, but it's hardly a precise indicator.\n\n\n\n\n   Karissa Bell for Engadget \n \n\nThe other major upgrade is the 12MP camera, which can now shoot in 3K compared to 1080p on previous models. The higher resolution video is, notably, not the default setting, but I appreciated having the option. I could see it being especially useful for creators looking to shoot POV footage, but I mostly use the glasses for still shots rather than video.\nSan Francisco is currently having a record-breaking cold summer so most of my testing has been in fairly overcast conditions. It might be a product of the gray weather, but I found the photos I've shot with the glasses a bit overly saturated for my taste. They looked fine on an Instagram Story, though. The camera has a bit of a wide angle with a 100-degree field of view, so there's still a bit of a learning curve in terms of figuring out how best to frame the shots. \nAnother issue is that it's very easy for a hat or a piece of hair to make it into your photos without realizing. My previous experience with the Ray-Ban Meta glasses meant I was careful to pull my hair back before snapping a picture, but I was bummed to realize after a long bike ride that the visor on my helmet was visible in the frame of every photo and video. It seems like Meta may have a plan to address this: I noticed a setting called \"media quality\" that's meant to alert you when something is partially obstructing the camera. The feature is apparently still testing, though, and it wasn't functional. A Meta spokesperson did confirm it would be added in a future update, though. \"Media Quality Check is a feature we're working to bring to our AI glasses collection in the future that will alert users when photos are blurry or if something like your hair or a hat blocks what you capture,\" Meta said.\nThe Meta AI app (formerly known as Meta View) can help fix other issues, though. It has a \"smart crop\" feature that can automatically straighten your pics to correct for any head tilt. It also has built in AI-powered edits for photos and video so you can restyle your clips directly in the app. And while the functionality isn't limited to clips shot with the glasses, the possibility of adding AI edits after the fact makes shooting otherwise mundane clips a bit more appealing. The ability to restyle video, however, is only \"free for a limited time,\" according to the Meta AI app. \nMeta AI\nWhile the core features of Meta's smart glasses have largely stayed the same since it first introduced the Ray-Ban Stories in 2021, one of the more interesting changes is how Mark Zuckerberg and other execs have shifted from calling them \"smart glasses\" to \"AI glasses.\" As the company has shifted away from the metaverse and made AI a central focus, it's not surprising those themes would play out in its wearables too.\nAnd while none of the Meta AI features are unique to the Oakley frames, Meta has added a couple of abilities since my last review that are worth mentioning. The first is live translation. The feature, which you have to enable in the Meta AI app, allows the onboard assistant to translate speech as you hear it. If both sides of a conversation have a pair of Meta glasses, then you can carry on a full conversation even if you don't speak the same language. The feature currently supports Spanish, French, Italian and English.\n\n\n\n\n   Karissa Bell for Engadget \n \n\nI tried it out with my husband — a native Spanish speaker who was also wearing a pair of Meta glasses — and we were both fairly impressed. I would say something in English and Meta AI on his glasses would relay it to him in Spanish. He would then respond in Spanish and Meta AI would translate the words into English.\nIt's not the most natural way to speak because you have to pause and wait for a translation, but it was mostly effective. There were a few bugs, though. Because we were sitting close to each other, sometimes Meta AI would overhear the translated audio from the other person's glasses and translate it back, which made the whole thing feel like a bizarre game of telephone.\nAnd over the course of a several-minute conversation, there were a handful of times when Meta AI wouldn't pick up on what was said at all, or would only begin translating halfway through a statement. We also encountered some issues with Meta AI's translations when it came to slang or regional variations of certain words. While it wasn't perfect, I could see it being useful while traveling since it's much smoother than using Google Translate. There was also something endlessly amusing about hearing my husband's words relayed back to me by the voice of AI Judi Dench (Meta tapped a bunch of celebrities last year to help voice its AI).\n\n\n\n   Stills from a video of a walk through a parking lot (left), and the same image after using the \"desert rave\" effect in Meta AI app. \n \n\n   Screenshots (Meta AI) \n \n\nThe other major AI addition is something called \"Live AI,\" which is essentially a real-time version of the glasses' multimodal powers. Once you start a Live AI session, Meta's assistant is able to \"see\" everything you're looking at and you can ask it questions without having to repeatedly say \"hey Meta.\" For example, you can look at plants and ask it to identify them, or ask about landmarks or your surroundings.\nThe feature can feel a bit gimmicky and it doesn't always work the way you want it to. For example, Meta AI can identify landmarks but it can't help you find them. While on a bike ride, I asked if it could help me navigate somewhere based on the intersection I was at and Meta AI responded that it was unable to help with navigation. It also didn't correctly identify some (admittedly exotic) plants during a walk through San Francisco's botanical gardens. But it did helpfully let me know that I may want to keep my distance from a pack of geese on the path.\nI'm still not entirely sure what problems these types of multimodal features are meant to solve, but I think it offers an interesting window into how Meta is positioning its smart glasses as an AI-first product. It also opens up some intriguing possibilities whenever we get a version of Meta glasses with an actual display, which the rumor mill suggests could come as soon as this year.\nWrap-up\nWhile I don't love the style of the Oakley Meta HSTN frames, Meta has shown that it's been consistently able to improve its glasses. The upgrades that come with the new Oakley frames aren't major leaps, but they deliver improvements to core features. Whether those upgrades justify the price, though, depends a lot on how you plan to use the glasses.\nThe special edition HSTN frames I tested are $499 and the other versions coming later this year will start at $399. Considering you can get several models of Meta's Ray-Ban glasses for just $299, I'm not sure the upgrades justify the added cost for most people. That's probably why Meta has positioned these as a \"performance\" model better suited to athletes and Oakley loyalists.\nBut the glasses do offer a clearer picture of where Meta is going with its smart glasses. We know the company is planning to add displays and, eventually, full augmented reality capabilities — both of which will benefit from better battery life and cameras. Both are also likely to cost a whole lot more than any of the frames we've seen so far. But, if you don't want to wait, the Oakley Meta glasses are the closest you can get to that right now.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wearables/oakley-meta-glasses-review-a-familiar-formula-with-some-upgrades-120026844.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "You might already have a good idea of which smartphone you want to be your next one. But there are more solid options available now than ever before, making the decision not as cut-and-dry as it used to be. While the decision is a bit easier if you know you want an iPhone, there's even enough variation between those new models that you may have to think about it longer than you anticipated. If you’re an Android person, you have even more options to choose from — including foldables — and more questions to answer before you spend any money.At Engadget, we review phones regularly and have tested dozens over the years. Whether you’ve had your eye on one of our current top picks, one of Samsung's Galaxy S25 phones, a cheap phone or another device, we’re here to help you decide which is the best phone to buy this year.\nAndroid or iOS?\nWhen you're searching for the best smartphone, it becomes clear that each OS has its pros and cons. Apple’s tight-knit ecosystem makes it super easy to share data between iPhones, iPads and Macs or seamlessly hand-off phone calls or music from one device to another. At the same time, you’re effectively locked in, as services like Apple Messages aren’t available on other platforms. \nAs for Android, there’s a much wider range of handsets from companies like Google, Samsung, Sony and more. However, Android phones don’t enjoy that same length of software support and often have lower trade-in values. In short, there’s no wrong answer. However, you will want to consider how your phone will fit in with the rest of your devices. So unless you’re really fed up with one OS and willing to learn another, it probably doesn’t make a lot of sense to switch from an iPhone to an Android phone (or vice versa) – especially if everyone else in your household is using the same platform.\nCameras\nSince your cell phone often pulls double duty as your primary camera, figuring out what kind of photo tools you want is key. Nowadays, practically every mobile phone can take a great picture in bright light. But if you want a long optical zoom, you’ll probably have to upgrade to a more expensive device.\n\n\n\n\n   Cherlynn Low / Engadget \n \n\nMid-range phones often only have two rear cameras (a primary wide-angle lens and a secondary ultra-wide camera) and can sometimes struggle in low-light situations. Each phone maker also has various features that might be a better fit for your style, with Apple offering four different color presets on the latest iPhones, while Google’s Pixel 9 Pro comes with neat tools like dedicated long exposure and Action Pan modes.\nWill you get mmWave 5G or Wi-Fi 7?\nThe good news is that in 2025, most phones have at least Wi-Fi 6 or Wi-Fi 6e and support for some kind of 5G connectivity. However, if you want the fastest wireless speeds possible, it’s going to cost you a little extra. For example, on certain networks, mmWave 5G offers up to gigabit download speeds, less latency and better bandwidth. But mmWave 5G also requires more sophisticated (and pricier) modems, which means support for it is often missing on less expensive devices.\nOn the bright side, mmWave 5G isn’t as widely available as other versions of 5G, so depending on where you live and what network you’re on, you may not be missing out on much right now if you buy a phone that doesn’t support it. It’s a similar situation for Wi-Fi 7, which is available on some high-end handsets like the Galaxy S25, but harder to find on cheaper devices. Wi-Fi 7 also requires you to have a compatible router, so unless you know you need it or have a specific use case in mind, the lack of support for mmWave 5G or Wi-Fi 7 shouldn’t be a dealbreaker when looking for a new phone.\nOther features to consider\nBecause not everyone agrees on what makes the best phone, you should think about any other specs that might be extra important for you. Mobile gamers will almost certainly appreciate the 120Hz refresh rates you get on phones like the Samsung Galaxy S25 or the Apple iPhone 16 Pro. Alternatively, if long battery life is important, you’ll probably want to go with a larger iPhone or an Android phone with a battery that’s between 4,000 and 5,000 mAh in size. Meanwhile, if you find yourself juggling a lot of devices, it can be really nice to have a phone that supports reverse wireless charging, which on Samsung phones even lets you recharge the company’s Galaxy Watches.\n \n \n \n \n \n \nOther smartphones we've tested\nSamsung Galaxy S25 Ultra\nLike its predecessor, the S25 Ultra is an incredibly versatile phone. It’s one of the few handsets that come with an included stylus and premium features like a gorgeous 6.9-inch AMOLED display, titanium frame and a 5x telephoto camera. It also has excellent performance and strong battery life. The issue is that, aside from improved AI, this year’s phone doesn’t offer that much more than the previous model (or the one before that), and with prices starting at $1,300, we feel it needs to do more to earn a top pick spot.\nOnePlus 13\nWhile the OnePlus 13 features some basic AI features like Google’s Circle to Search and Gemini assistant, it’s really just an old-fashioned flagship in all the best ways. That’s because instead of focusing on machine learning, OnePlus crammed the phone with tons of top-notch hardware. It sports a 6.8-inch OLED display with an incredible peak brightness of up to 4,500 nits. The OP13 also offers excellent performance thanks to Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 8 Elite chip, along with 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage. There are also three 50-MP rear cameras including one with a 3x telephoto zoom and a massive 6,000 mAh battery that’s bigger than what you get in practically all of its competitors.\nOnePlus didn’t skimp on the phone’s design either, as the OP13 still comes with the company’s signature Alert Slider. Plus, if you opt for the blue or white variants, you’ll get a durable and very touchable vegan leather back that helps the phone stand out among all its glass brick rivals. But the best part is that starting at $900, it costs less than an equivalent Galaxy S25+ too.\nFAQs\nHow do I know which smartphone is the best for me?\nWhile choosing the best smartphone can be challenging, it mostly comes down to how you plan on using the device. All of the best phones available now get the basics right — you’ll be able to make calls, text and access the internet without many hiccups. If your smartphone is your most used gadget, you may want to consider paying for a device on the higher end of the price spectrum. That will get you better overall performance, higher-quality cameras and a phone that will last for many years. If you don’t use your phone for everything, you may be able to compromise on performance and extra perks and spend less on a still-capable handset.\nHow much is a smartphone?\nSmartphones range in price from $300 to over $1,500. The best budget phones available now will usually compromise on overall performance, design, camera prowess and extra features to keep costs down. On the flip side, the most expensive phones will have powerful processors, triple-camera arrays and even flip or fold designs. Most people will find a phone that fits their needs somewhere in the middle of that wide price range — we’ve found that most of the best smartphones available right now cost between $500 and $1,000.\nWhat can you do on a smartphone?\nSmartphones are essentially small, portable computers that let you do things like check email, browse social media, follow map directions, make contactless payments and more. This is all on top of the basics like making phone calls and texting, which we’ve come to expect in all modern cell phones. Smartphones have also mostly replaced compact cameras thanks to their high-quality, built-in shooters, and the fact that most smartphones today as just as portable, if not more so, as compact cameras.\nHow long do smartphones last?\nSmartphones can last years and people are holding on to their phones longer now than ever before. Software updates and battery life are two of the biggest factors that can affect phone longevity. Apple promises five years worth of software updates for its latest iPhones, and Google promises the same for its Pixel phones. Samsung phones will get four years worth of Android updates from the time they launch. As for charging speeds and battery life, your phone can deteriorate over time as you use and recharge your phone on a regular basis.\nRecent updates\nJuly 2025: Updated to include the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7.\nApril 2025: Updated to include the Google Pixel 9a.\nFebruary 2025: Updated to include the iPhone 16e.\nJanuary 2025: Updated to include details about Samsung's latest Galaxy S-series phones.\nSeptember 2024: Updated to include the latest iPhone 16 models and a new midrange iPhone top pick.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/best-smartphones-140004900.html?src=rss",
    "full_text": "When you're searching for the best smartphone, it becomes clear that each OS has its pros and cons. However, Android phones don’t enjoy that same length of software support and often have lower trade-in values. Each phone maker also has various features that might be a better fit for your style, with Apple offering four different color presets on the latest iPhones, while Google’s Pixel 9 Pro comes with neat tools like dedicated long exposure and Action Pan modes. But mmWave 5G also requires more sophisticated (and pricier) modems, which means support for it is often missing on less expensive devices. As we discovered in our testing for the iPhone 16 Pro review, it’ll take a bit of getting used to at first. The Pixel 9 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro both start at $999, and though some of us have come to think of Google's handsets as the more competitively priced option, this year's model might be good enough to justify a premium price. There are other factors to consider, like whether you regularly use MagSafe accessories or wireless charging. So while it's not super fancy, the phone has all of its most important bases covered (and then some). Sadly there’s still no dedicated telephoto lens, which makes it less useful in some shooting situations. But the best part is that starting at $900, it costs less than an equivalent Galaxy S25+ too."

    "summary": "Managing your finances doesn’t have to be complicated, and there are so many tools available now that can make things easier (and even partially automated) for you. I was a Mint user for many years, but I was forced to find a new budgeting app after the service shut down in March 2024. Mint’s parent company, Intuit, prompted folks to try their other financial app, Credit Karma. However, after testing Credit Karma myself, I found it to be a poor Mint replacement. So I set out to try all of the best budgeting apps available today to find a new home for all of my financial tracking and goal-setting. Hopefully my journey can help you find the best budgeting app for you and your money as well.\nBest budget apps of 2025\n \n \n \n \n \nOther budgeting apps we tested\nPocketGuard\nPocketGuard used to be a solid free budget tracker, but the company has since limited its “free” version to just a free seven-day trial. Now, you’ll have to choose between two plans once the trial is over: a $13 monthly plan or a $75 annual plan. When I first tested it, I found it to be more restricted than NerdWallet, but still a decent option. The main overview screen shows you your net worth, total assets and debts; net income and total spending for the month; upcoming bills; a handy reminder of when your next paycheck lands; any debt payoff plan you have; and any goals. Like some other apps, including Quicken Simplifi, PocketGuard promotes an “after bills” approach, where you enter all of your recurring bills, and then PocketGuard shows you what’s left, and that’s what you’re supposed to be budgeting: your disposable income. \nAlthough PocketGuard’s UI is easy enough to understand, it lacks polish. The “accounts” tab is a little busy, and doesn’t show totals for categories like cash or investments. Seemingly small details like weirdly phrased or punctuated copy occasionally make the app feel janky. More than once, it prompted me to update the app when no updates were available. The web version, meanwhile, feels like the mobile app blown up to a larger format and doesn’t take advantage of the extra screen real estate. Ultimately, now that the free tier is gone, it just doesn’t present the same value proposition as it once did.\nHow we test budgeting apps\nBefore I dove in and started testing out budgeting apps, I had to do some research. To find a list of apps to try out, I consulted trusty ol’ Google (and even trustier Reddit); read reviews of popular apps on the App Store; and also asked friends and colleagues what budget tracking apps (or other budgeting methods) they might be using for money management. Some of the apps I found were free and these, of course, show loads of ads (excuse me, “offers”) to stay in business. But most of the available apps require paid subscriptions, with prices typically topping out around $100 a year, or $15 a month. (Spoiler: My top pick is cheaper than that.)\nAll of the services I chose to test needed to do several things: import all of your account data into one place; offer budgeting tools; and track your spending, net worth and credit score. Except where noted, all of these apps are available for iOS, Android and on the web.\nOnce I had my shortlist of six apps, I got to work setting them up. For the sake of thoroughly testing these apps, I made a point of adding every account to every budgeting app, no matter how small or immaterial the balance. What ensued was a veritable Groundhog Day of two-factor authentication. Just hours of entering passwords and one-time passcodes, for the same banks half a dozen times over. Hopefully, you only have to do this once.\nBudgeting app FAQs\nWhat is Plaid and how does it work?\nEach of the apps I tested uses the same underlying network, called Plaid, to pull in financial data, so it’s worth explaining what it is and how it works. Plaid was founded as a fintech startup in 2013 and is today the industry standard in connecting banks with third-party apps. Plaid works with over 12,000 financial institutions across the US, Canada and Europe. Additionally, more than 8,000 third-party apps and services rely on Plaid, the company claims.\nTo be clear, you don’t need a dedicated Plaid app to use it; the technology is baked into a wide array of apps, including all of the budgeting apps listed in this guide. Once you find the “add an account” option in whichever one you’re using, you’ll see a menu of commonly used banks. There’s also a search field you can use to look yours up directly. Once you find yours, you’ll be prompted to enter your login credentials. If you have two-factor authentication set up, you’ll need to enter a one-time passcode as well.\nAs the middleman, Plaid is a passthrough for information that may include your account balances, transaction history, account type and routing or account number. Plaid uses encryption, and says it has a policy of not selling or renting customer data to other companies. However, I would not be doing my job if I didn’t note that in 2022 Plaid was forced to pay $58 million to consumers in a class action suit for collecting “more financial data than was needed.” As part of the settlement, Plaid was compelled to change some of its business practices.\nIn a statement provided to Engadget, a Plaid spokesperson said the company continues to deny the allegations underpinning the lawsuit and that “the crux of the non-financial terms in the settlement are focused on us accelerating workstreams already underway related to giving people more transparency into Plaid’s role in connecting their accounts, and ensuring that our workstreams around data minimization remain on track.”\nWhy did Mint shut down?\nWhen parent company Intuit announced in December 2023 that it would shut down Mint, it did not provide a reason why it made the decision to do so. It did say that Mint's millions of users would be funneled over to its other finance app, Credit Karma. \"Credit Karma is thrilled to invite all Minters to continue their financial journey on Credit Karma, where they will have access to Credit Karma’s suite of features, products, tools and services, including some of Mint’s most popular features,\" Mint wrote on its product blog. In our testing, we found that Credit Karma isn't an exact replacement for Mint — so if you're still looking for a Mint alternative, you have some decent options.\nWhat about Rocket Money?\nRocket Money is another free financial app that tracks spending and supports things like balance alerts and account linking. If you pay for the premium tier, the service can also help you cancel unwanted subscriptions. We did not test it for this guide, but we'll consider it in future updates.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/apps/best-budgeting-apps-120036303.html?src=rss",
    "full_text": "I was particularly impressed at how easily it connected to Fidelity; not all budget trackers do, for whatever reason. Monarch has also made it easier to connect through those other two networks, if for some reason Plaid fails. Instead of manually uploading statements, the new functionality allows apps like Monarch's to automatically pull in transactions and balance history. The key metrics that it highlights most prominently are your cash flow, net worth and credit score. But until it follows through, I can’t recommend Copilot for most people with so many good competitors out there. In particular, Copilot does a better job than almost any other app of visualizing your recurring monthly expenses. It’s a good way to both weed out fraudulent charges, and also be somewhat intentional about your spending habits. The “accounts” tab is a little busy, and doesn’t show totals for categories like cash or investments. Plaid uses encryption, and says it has a policy of not selling or renting customer data to other companies. It did say that Mint's millions of users would be funneled over to its other finance app, Credit Karma."

    "summary": "The United Kingdom's Online Safety Act took effect on July 25th. Among other provisions, the new law makes websites responsible for protecting UK children from content deemed harmful, like pornography or the promotion of eating disorders. This has resulted in many of the most-used websites, including Pornhub, X and Reddit, either putting up or planning to put up age verification barriers to restrict access by minors.\nAge-restricting laws put broadly popular websites in a difficult position. Sites like Reddit that rely on user-generated content have no good way of making sure nobody under 18 ever sees restricted material anywhere on the platform, so it's usually simpler to just ban minors altogether. But this creates a knock-on problem: underage users relying on unvetted free virtual private networks (VPNs) to get back on their favorite platforms.\nUK residents are using VPNs to change their apparent locations to other countries and circumvent the Online Safety Act. In the few days since the law went into force, five of the 10 most-downloaded free apps in the UK have been VPNs. We like two of the five, Proton VPN and NordVPN, but NordVPN does not have a free plan — just a seven-day free trial, after which you have to pay. The other three are unvetted, untested and suspiciously generic (VPN Super Unlimited Proxy, FreeVPN.org and Unlimited VPN Proxy).\nWhen you use a VPN, all your web traffic goes through one of the VPN's servers before moving on to its ultimate destination. Every time you connect, you're trusting the VPN not to abuse its access to your information, and some VPNs unfortunately abuse that trust. A free VPN is generally safe if it's supported by paid subscriptions, like Proton is. If there is no paid tier, or the free tier comes with no restrictions, you have to ask yourself where the money is coming from. \nThe saying that \"if the product is free, then the real product is you\" holds true here. For example, Hola VPN admits in its terms of service that its sister company Bright Data can sell free users' residential IPs as proxy servers, and Hotspot Shield was the subject of an FTC complaint in 2017 that charged it with providing personally identifiable information to advertisers. And one of the services on the UK's top 10 list, FreeVPN.org, has no address on its website and a frighteningly sparse privacy policy.\nMalware is the other significant risk. A 2016 study analyzed 283 Android apps with VPN capability, and found malware in 38% of them. Nor has the threat diminished in the 10 years since — just this year, threat analysts at CYFIRMA reported on a free VPN shared on GitHub being used as a malware vector. \nIn the end, a fully free VPN has no real reason to protect you or your rights, and every incentive to milk you for profit. Whatever you choose to do with a VPN, make sure you're picking one that will keep you save without exploiting you. Green flags include a clear pricing structure, audits from independent firms in the last three years, a specific physical location on the VPN's website and a thorough privacy policy. Some trustworthy free VPNs include the aforementioned Proton VPN, plus hide.me, TunnelBear and Windscribe.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/vpns-are-booming-in-the-uk-after-age-restriction-laws-but-free-options-carry-big-risks-060036636.html?src=rss",
