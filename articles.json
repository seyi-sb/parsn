While AI labs commonly work with several data labeling vendors – Meta has been working with Mercor and Surge since before TBD Labs was spun up – it’s rare for an AI lab to invest so heavily in one data vendor. That makes this situation especially notable: even with Meta’s multi-billion-dollar investment, several sources said that researchers in TBD Labs see Scale AI’s data as low quality and have expressed a preference to work with Surge and Mercor. They’re here to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge. They’re here to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge. Although Scale AI has moved to attract these subject matter experts with its Outlier platform, competitors like Surge and Mercor have been growing quickly because their business models were built on a foundation of high-paid talent from the outset. A Meta spokesperson disputed the fact that there are quality issues with Scale AI’s product. Aside from Wang, there’s an open question around how valuable Scale is to Meta. Some of the new AI researchers recently brought in from OpenAI have already left Meta, Wired previously reported. Update: This story has been updated with comments from Mayer, who reached out to TechCrunch after publication."

    "full_text": "This is the third full Universes Beyond set -- Magic's name for products based on outside properties. While Universes Beyond has introduced myriad properties from Stranger Things to Spongebob as smaller card selections, the Spider-Man set follows Final Fantasy as the second Universes Beyond set to be legal in most formats. An Avatar: The Last Airbender set will be hot on its heels later this year. We also got our first look at Eddie Brock, aka Venom. Like some of the Spider-people, he's a transforming modal dual-faced card, meaning you can cast either side or cast one side and then transform it. The set introduces a new \"web-slinging\" mechanic, which lets you pay alternate (usually cheaper) costs for creatures if you also return a tapped creature to your hand -- representing Spidey or an ally swinging in to save the day. Magic: The Gathering Spider-Man also debuts a new \"mayhem\" mechanic, allowing you to cast a card from your graveyard if you discarded it that turn. Web-slinging costs usually let you cast the creature earlier than its mana cost allows. This bonus sheet reprint of Heroic Intervention uses cover art from the first Spider-Man comic. Players can collect it in normal, showcase or special infinity foil treatment."

    "full_text": "Fresh on the heels of August's black moon is September's full moon, which will be among the most interesting full moons of 2025. Most of the rest of Europe and Africa will see a partial eclipse, while North and South America are left out this time around. What's left passes through Earth's atmosphere on its way to the moon, which filters out the blue light. That leaves only the sun's red light to hit the moon and reflect to Earth, giving it a reddish glow. This effect lasts roughly two hours and will only happen in the regions that can witness the lunar eclipse. The moon will remain almost full for a couple of days immediately before and after Sept. 7, giving you several days to view the full moon. Total lunar eclipses are less frequent than partial eclipses, making September's full moon a special occasion for those in the eclipse's path. The next total eclipse is due in March 2026, but it will take place primarily in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean, where virtually no one will be able to see it. The next five will be New Year's Eve in 2028, June 2029, December 2029 and then two more in 2032. Numerous websites, including Time and Date, FOX Weather and the Royal Observatory in Greenwich will livestream the happenings."

    "full_text": "But even without higher component costs or tariffs, the iPhone has been overdue for a price increase. Also, I use the US starting price for each iPhone before any carrier discounts are applied. Since its debut in 2007, the standard iPhone has had four price increases and one correction. Up till then, all other standard iPhone models had only a single rear camera. If Apple follows its previous pattern, then the standard iPhone is due for a price increase. Now, we just need to wonder how much tariffs and politics might drive the price up even more. But when you factor in everything that's happened this year, it's hard to gauge just how much the price will go up and whether that'll affect just one or two models, or apply across the entire iPhone 17 line. But we do have an unusual-for-Apple clue as to how these tariffs could affect the company. And that was three weeks before Trump threatened another tariff aimed purely at the iPhone. If there's one thing for certain, we'll know exactly what those prices will be when Apple launches the next generation of iPhone models at its September event."

We'll also learn how much the new iPhone will cost, which is also still up in the air, thanks in part to constantly changing tariffs. Don't miss any of our unbiased tech content and lab-based reviews. For nearly a decade, Apple has announced its new iPhone lineup in early September. A supposed leak reported on by German site iPhone-Ticker lines up with expert opinion, and we cannot verify these dates because we don't have access to the internal documents iPhone-Ticker is sourcing. Here's a chart for the release dates of previous iPhone models: To see this year's dates in the same chart format (because some of us prefer an easy-to-read chart), the schedule looks like this. Based on last year's release, Apple may release everything in the fall except its least expensive option -- this year, the iPhone 17E. Apple is expected to change its release format with the rumored iPhone 18. Reports suggest that Apple will only release higher-end models in fall 2026 -- iPhone 18 Pro, Pro Max, Air and a rumored new foldable iPhone -- and release the rest of the line in winter 2027."

    "full_text": "Showrunner’s clips are all styled to match the aesthetics of one of the platform’s preset shows, like Exit Valley, a cartoon that appears to be a cross between Silicon Valley and Family Guy. When I spoke with Saatchi recently, he admitted to being a bit too high on his own supply during his time with Oculus and deeply humbled when that version of the company ultimately came to an end. But the character was limited to reciting canned bits of dialogue rather than responding with context-specific speech. This hurdle got Saatchi thinking more seriously about how he might be able to build Lucy as a complex “digital being” capable of having complicated interactions with people. “We made Lucy into a character that you can talk to and video chat with,” Saatchi said. I feel like the industry is kind of cutting off that exploratory element with generative AI by just shoving it into movies.” When I brought up the ongoing conversation about gen AI’s potential to put people in creative fields out of work, Saatchi said what almost everyone in his position says — that he sees Showrunner as a platform that’s meant to supplement traditionally produced entertainment rather than replace it. “If all that we can do with such a powerful technology is just cut jobs, what was the point? “These models would have real characters and a world that could be explored through prompting, and you could also inadvertently trigger scenes within those worlds in a way that would make it feel as though you’re uncovering something unknown.” But he agreed when I pointed out that the system he’s describing makes it sound like Showrunner would effectively turn its subscribers into unpaid employees working for some of Hollywood’s biggest and most powerful studios."

The Post also reports that Swift's new engagement ring is \"an old mine brilliant-cut diamond in a gold bezel setting, which was designed by Kelce himself with the help of Kindred Lubeck of Artifex Fine Jewelry.\" Such diamonds are square with rounded corners and have 58 facets, making them anything but a \"paper ring.\" Just imagine the excitement when the wedding details start trickling out, and Swift begins to \"pick out a white dress,\" as Juliet does in Swift's hit song Love Story. One meme post on X showed Paul Revere's famed ride, captioned \"me telling everyone I know that Taylor Swift got engaged.\" One Bluesky user wrote, \"Very interesting that Taylor Swift got engaged mere months after I did. Be sure to leave enough in the account for your monthly expenses.\" We're pretty sure this person really does know who Swift is, but their post was funny anyway."

Microsoft didn’t mention many specific features or changes in the update, other than confirming it shares the same new features and enhancements as the previous version, 24H2, which flips on new features throughout the year, along with some notes for IT: Windows 11, version 25H2 also includes some feature removals such as PowerShell 2.0 and Windows Management Instrumentation command-line (WMIC). And for our commercial customers, Windows 11, version 25H2 includes the ability for IT admins to remove select pre-installed Microsoft Store apps via Group Policy/MDM CSP on Enterprise/EDU devices. As Microsoft detailed in June, using its shared servicing branch means updating from the current 24H2 version to 25H2 takes a single restart, as new features are added in earlier updates but left disabled until the enablement package activates them. To get the update, you can join the Release Preview channel and get Windows 11, version 25H2 (Build 26200.5074) now by going to the Windows Update section of settings and choosing to install it."

    "full_text": "But one thing that hasn’t been mentioned was support for Matter-over-Thread. While there’s no confirmation that support is coming, there’s compelling evidence to suggest it might be. While Hue devices have been capable of connecting via Matter using the Hue Bridge as a middleman, they’ve never supported the protocol directly. That’s in part because Matter only works via Ethernet, Wi-Fi, and Thread; Hue has been a Zigbee and Bluetooth-only ecosystem for years. Then there’s the since-removed FCC filing discovered by HueBlog. This almost certainly means the lightbulb will connect directly via Matter. Wi-Fi is a possibility, but the more logical option would be Thread, which is low-power and can create self-healing mesh networks. The one issue is, there’s no mention of Thread or Wi-Fi in the FCC filing anywhere, only Bluetooth and Zigbee. Philips isn’t about to abandon Zigbee for Thread overnight, but this would give users direct access to Hue bulbs from any Matter controller, with the Bridge only needed for some advanced features, like dynamic lighting effects. Plus there’s a growing momentum behind Matter-over-Thread, with Ikea recently announcing over 20 products supporting it."

Drivers have long criticized the system for giving companies broad control over pay and deactivations, leaving them limited power to influence earnings or working conditions. Supporters of the new agreement say it could give drivers a stronger voice in pushing back against unfair treatment. “Some drivers fear getting deactivated and losing their jobs, so we often feel pressured to stay silent instead of demanding fair treatment."

    "summary": "We're now less than two weeks away from the Apple iPhone 17 event. Themed \"Awe dropping\" this year, the event — confirmed after Apple sent \"save the date\" invitations to the media on August 26 — will be livestreamed on YouTube September 9 at 1PM ET from Cupertino. And Engadget staff will be there, reporting and liveblogging from Apple Park to give their hands-on impressions. This year is shaking up to be a departure from recent September product rollouts, with the strong possibility of an all-new superthin iPhone expected to join the company's lineup. Also on tap could be new Apple Watch models — including the first truly new Ultra model in two years — and (maybe) the long-awaited AirPods Pro 3.\nWe got a full rundown of what to expect at the event from the best possible source: Bloomberg Apple reporter extraordinaire Mark Gurman. During his recent guest appearance on the Engadget Podcast, Gurman shared his analysis of what we expect to see, including the expected battery and camera compromises of that rumored thin iPhone (which everyone already calls the iPhone Air). \n\n\n\nExpected to be roughly 5.55 mm thick, the iPhone Air would be the thinnest iPhone yet, besting 2014's iPhone 6 which, at 6.9 mm, was the previous svelteness champ. And they've only gotten chunkier since then. (The iPhone 16 Pro has a depth of 8.25 mm.) The Air would also give Apple a direct rival to Samsung's Galaxy S25 Edge, which we found to be more than a gimmick.\nApple (screenshot)\nBut the iPhone Air's thin design will likely lead to some compromises. It's rumored to have only a single 48 MP camera and a smaller battery. So, expect a stylish phone that... won't be for everyone.\nThe Pro lineup could offer some design tweaks and performance improvements. The iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max are rumored to switch from titanium to aluminum. They could also see the rear camera array expand to an entire \"island\" that extends across most of the phone's backside. It's expected to house three cameras (as before), but multiple rumors have suggested it will have an improved telephoto one. The zoom lens could jump to 48MP, which would strengthen its digital zooming / cropping chops. The phones may also add an anti-glare coating, similar to those found on iPads.\nThe standard iPhone 17 could see some welcome display upgrades. At least one supply chain source claimed it will add a 120Hz variable refresh rate (ProMotion) display, which the Pro series has used since 2021.\nApple\nOne thing we know without a doubt is that the new iPhones will launch with iOS 26, which brings Apple's biggest design refresh in years. It's easy to imagine the company highlighting the new model's displays as the best way to experience the new Liquid Glass visual language. As for the naming scheme, there haven't been any leaks pointing to a similar hardware rebranding (\"iPhone 26,\" \"iPhone 26 Pro,\" etc.). But hey, Apple does like surprises.\nEngadget's iPhone 17 rumor roundup gives you a deeper dive into what to expect from the new models.\nCherlynn Low for Engadget\nApple's fall event isn't just for iPhones. The company is also expected to roll out new Apple Watch models. 5G and a processor upgrade are expected for the Apple Watch Ultra 3. It may also let you send texts via satellite, handy for those who use it out in the wilderness. Regardless of the details, Apple hasn't launched a new rugged and premium model since 2023 (apart from a new color), so it's due for an upgrade.\nThe Series 11 model is unlikely to depart dramatically from the Series 10. After all, that model introduced a new design, with a thinner body and larger screen. (And Apple has historically kept those around in three-year cycles.). But a faster chip also seems logical. Perhaps we'll see 5G arrive on the standard wearable, too.\nWe may also see the AirPods Pro 3 at the event. It's been about three years since Apple last upgraded its premium earbuds. The new model could also bring some biometric sensors to the earphones: an in-ear heart-rate monitor and (maybe) temperature sensing. Live translation is also rumored, although that may not be exclusive to the third-gen model. But don't expect major design changes, if the latest reports from leaker Majin Bu (via MacRumors) are to be believed: In addition to a \"slight reduction in size,\" Bu notes the case will lose the physical pairing button, while gaining capacitive controls.\nWill there be other announcements? Time will tell, but now we know we won't have to wait long to find out. The official countdown clock has begun, and the answers are just days away.\nUpdate, August 29, 2025, 2:32PM ET: Added insights from Bloomberg's Mark Gurman based on his appearance on the Engadget Podcast.\nUpdate, August 28, 2025, 10:45AM ET: Added new report on AirPods 3 case details. \nUpdate, August 26, 2025, 5:41PM ET: Added confirmation of official event invitation, date and time. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/apples-iphone-17-awe-dropping-event-is-on-september-9--heres-what-we-expect-090059664.html?src=rss",

As we continue to refine our systems, we’re adding more guardrails as an extra precaution — including training our AIs not to engage with teens on these topics, but to guide them to expert resources, and limiting teen access to a select group of AI characters for now.\"\nNotably, the new protections are described as being in place \"for now,\" as Meta is apparently still working on more permanent measures to address growing concerns around teen safety and its AI. \"These updates are already in progress, and we will continue to adapt our approach to help ensure teens have safe, age-appropriate experiences with AI,” Otway said. The new protections will be rolling out over the next few weeks and apply to all teen users using Meta AI in English-speaking countries.\nMeta's policies have also caught the attention of lawmakers and other officials, with Senator Josh Hawley recently telling the company he planned to launch an investigation over its handling of such interactions. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has also indicated he wants to investigate Meta for allegedly misleading children about mental health claims made by its chatbots.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/meta-is-re-training-its-ai-so-it-wont-discuss-self-harm-or-have-romantic-conversations-with-teens-182418587.html?src=rss",

Earlier this summer, the chatbot started producing extremely racist and antisemitic content, a few days after xAI founder Elon Musk posted that the company had \"improved Grok significantly.\" xAI pulled the update soon after and shared that it had \"taken action to ban hate speech before Grok posts on X.\" Bias is always an issue with AI chatbots, but Grok has illustrated how quickly the tech can spiral into being used to quickly produce potentially abusive content."

    "summary": "IFA, Europe's answer to the CES, kicks off on September 5 in Berlin, Germany. The show likely won't be the biggest source of news in September — Apple's iPhone launch event is officially happening on September 9 — but it is usually home to its fair share of announcements. IFA 2024 featured new \"AI PCs\" from ASUS and Dell, including the first Inspiron laptop with Qualcomm's Snapdragon X Plus chip. There were plenty of more unusual ideas, too: Honor used the show to introduce a laptop with a detachable webcam, for example.\nBased on the companies that are confirmed to have presence at the show, similar themes will be woven through IFA 2025. AI and features enabled by it will likely be everywhere, especially in home appliances. Laptops, whether they're running Intel's Panther Lake chips or something Arm-based, are sure to be in the mix. And smart glasses will likely continue to be a going concern. Below are the companies who are confirmed to be holding events at the show, and what we think they might announce.\nSamsung\nSamsung\nWith the Galaxy S25, Galaxy Z foldables and Galaxy Watch 8 in the rear view, there aren't many personal electronics Samsung has left to announce this year. That could be why the company's IFA press conference seems focused on the smart home. Samsung's IFA presentation, dubbed \"AI Home: Future Living, Now\" is supposed to be focused on the company's home appliances. Specifically, Samsung says it will \"highlight the transformative potential of AI in the home.\" Samsung already showed off how AI plays into its new Bespoke AI home appliances at CES 2025, so it's possible the company could have new additions to the lineup. It'll hopefully also share when its Ballie robot will be available for purchase.\nWe also know for a fact that Samsung is hosting a virtual Unpacked event on September 4, which could point to some other products the company will show off at IFA 2025. All signs point to the next Unpacked being about tablets and midrange phones. Samsung is rumored to be announcing both the Galaxy Tab S11 and S11 Ultra, which will carry over the general look and feel of the company's past tablets with a few important tweaks, according to WinFuture. Besides battery improvements and Android 16, the biggest change Samsung is reportedly making is using a MediaTek Dimensity 9400 chip in the tablets rather than its own Exynos models or something from Qualcomm. The Snapdragon 8 Elite is considered the top of the line, so opting for MediaTek could raise questions about performance, but we'll have to use the tablets to know for sure.\nSamsung is also rumored to be announcing the Galaxy S25 FE at the event. It becomes less clear by the year what \"FE\" or \"Fan Edition\" means, but the Galaxy S25 FE is expected to have some meaningful improvements over the Galaxy S24 FE. Alongside a Samsung-designed Exynos chip, the S25 FE is rumored to feature an improved 12MP selfie camera and a 4,900mAh battery with 45W charging, according to SamMobile.\nAcer\nSam Rutherford for Engadget\nLike Samsung, Acer is hosting its own press conference at IFA 2025. The company's description of the event is frustratingly vague, but does suggest announcements focused on both productivity and gaming. At IFA 2024, Acer introduced multiple Copilot+PCs, including updates to the company's Swift and Aspire lines with the latest Intel Core Ultra chips and Windows AI features. Updates to both lineups seem highly likely at IFA 2025. Don't be surprised if Acer shows off some more concept devices, too. The company's Acer Project DualPlay, a laptop with a detachable game controller, was a big hit at last year's show, and something the company is bound to top.\nWhen it comes to handheld gaming PCs, Acer's detailed its plans to sell three different sizes of handheld, the Acer Nitro Blaze 11, Blaze 8 and Blaze 7, but yet to release them all globally. It might make sense to use IFA 2025 to finalize that and tease whatever it's working on next.\nLenovo\nSam Rutherford for Engadget\nWhen it comes to Lenovo, the company has a tried and true playbook for events like IFA. It demoes a slew of new laptops, updates its non-foldable Motorola phones and introduces one or two absolutely bizarre concept devices. The pattern seems like it'll repeat for IFA 2025.\nIf the stars of last year's show were a 16-inch Legion gaming laptop and an \"Auto Twist\" concept that swivels with a voice command, this year Lenovo's looking at a different kind of rotation. Leaker Evan Blass shared images at what looks like a new concept laptop with a display that can be rotated into portrait orientation. Blass also shared images of three new Moto phones, and two new Lenovo tablets.\nLenovo has a habit of showing off concept devices at trade shows, some of which are precursors to shipping products -- a la the ThinkBook Plus Gen 6 w/ rollable display -- while others will never see the light of day. At next week's IFA/Innovation Week, that concept will be a… pic.twitter.com/PMIJdowgHG— Evan Blass (@evleaks) August 28, 2025\n\nLenovo has a new handheld PC of its own to announce, too. The company released the Lenovo Legion Go S earlier this year, and now it's reportedly ready to announce the Lenovo Legion Go 2. The new handheld is rumored to feature a new AMD Ryzen Z2 Extreme chip, the same detachable, Switch-style controllers and more RAM. If Lenovo announces the handheld, it'll likely be the most powerful handheld gaming PC available for purchase, with a price tag to match.\n...but most eyes will probably be on the second-generation Legion Go (whose doppelganger, the Steam-powered Legion Go S, was revealed earlier this year at MWC). pic.twitter.com/G03WzvODBj— Evan Blass (@evleaks) August 29, 2025\n\nHisense\nHisense\nAccording to the event description for Hisense's IFA 2025 press conference, the company plans to \"further upgrade its RGB-MiniLED TV with powerful hardware improvements and AI-driven software.\" Hisense introduced the 116-inch UX RGB-MiniLED TV back in July, what the company claims is the first mass-produced television with dedicated red, green and blue LEDs. The approach lets the TV reach a peak brightness of 8,000 nits, among other benefits.\nDetailing how much the TV will cost, and what kind of features its \"Hi-View AI Engine X\" chip will power makes sense. Don't be surprised if Hisense also takes time to talk about the even bigger 136-inch MX MicroLED TV it announced at CES 2025, too.\nAnker\nValentina Palladino for Engadget\nWith Google fully embracing Qi2 charging on its Pixel 10 phones, there's never been a better time for Anker to announce new Qi2 chargers. Given that the company's IFA press conference is supposed to feature \"major product launches that bring intelligence into everyday life,\" it seems like AI features are a safe bet. That likely means Anker's Eufy or Soundcore brands could be the real focus. Maybe the company has new AI improvements for its Eufy robot vacuums, or audio improvements for its Soundcore headphones? We'll have to wait for IFA to start to find out.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/ifa-2025-what-to-expect-from-samsung-acer-lenovo-and-more-181825489.html?src=rss",

Apple said at the time that the flaw was used in an “extremely sophisticated attack against specific targeted individuals.” Now we know that dozens of WhatsApp users were targeted with this pair of flaws. Donncha Ó Cearbhaill, who heads Amnesty International’s Security Lab, described the attack in a post on X as an “advanced spyware campaign” that targeted users over the past 90 days, or since the end of May. The two bugs chained together allow an attacker to deliver a malicious exploit through WhatsApp that’s capable of stealing data from the user’s Apple device. This is not the first time that WhatsApp users have been targeted by government spyware, a kind of malware capable of breaking into fully patched devices with vulnerabilities not known to the vendor, known as zero-day flaws. In May, a U.S. court ordered spyware maker NSO Group to pay WhatsApp $167 million in damages for a 2019 hacking campaign that broke into the devices of more than 1,400 WhatsApp users with an exploit capable of planting NSO’s Pegasus spyware. WhatsApp brought the legal case against NSO, citing a breach of federal and state hacking laws, as well as its own terms of service. Did you receive a notification that your device was compromised?

Developer Playtonic is staffed with people who worked on Rare titles like the aforementioned Banjo and the Donkey Kong Country games. There's also a bigger map, a refined story and enhanced graphics. The digital version of the game will cost $30, while physical copies will cost $50. There's a promotion going for long-time fans, as those who already own the game will get 30 percent off so long as they buy the remaster on the same platform family as the original."

    "summary": "In just over a week, the Apple iPhone 17 event will be here — it's Tuesday, September 9 — and we'll finally get to see the new iPhone 17 lineup. Assuming Apple sticks to tradition, we should be able to install iOS 26 roughly one week after the event. But you don't have to wait to test out the new features because you can download and install the newly released public beta 5 (or iOS 26 developer beta 8 for developers). I've been playing around with it for the past couple of weeks, and have found that taking screenshots is way better in the new operating system, as well as getting to choose how long you snooze. Even the refreshed Camera app is easier to navigate. You can see a more complete view of the new features in our preview of the iOS 26 public beta release, which shows off the fresh home and lock screen redesign. Called Liquid Glass, the translucent look will extend across all of Apple's upcoming operating systems. The overhaul is one of several big changes coming to iOS, macOS, iPadOS and the rest of Apple's software suite, all of which were showcased during the company's WWDC keynote on June 9.\nAfter overpromising on AI plans last year, Apple kept its iOS roadmap focused more on basic quality of life improvements this year. There are multiple useful additions coming to the Phone and Messages apps on your iPhone, for instance: Apple execs outlined the ability to weed out spam texts or other unknown senders and an option to hold your spot on a phone call when you've been waiting for a representative to pick up. Plus, a treasured feature that we took for granted is coming back (hint: it's in the Photos app).\nWith each beta, it seems like additional new improvements are popping up, like this new AirPods gesture we're all curious about, and this FaceTime feature that'll freeze your video if it detects nudity. With the release of the iOS 26 developer beta 5, we saw more added features, like a new bouncy animation on the passcode screen and in the Control Center, MacRumors reports. Some or all of those changes will likely soon migrate into the separate public beta (see below). Most newer iPhone models are eligible to download iOS 26 (both the betas and final version). Want to see the full list of new features coming this fall? Read on. \nWhat is iOS 26?\nThe current iPhone operating system is iOS 18, and Apple is still actively updating it — version 18.6.1 was released to restore Apple Watch blood oxygen monitoring functionality for certain users in the US. More recently, Apple released 18.6.2 to address a vulnerability related to image processing. Apple has officially stopped signing iOS 18.6, MacRumors reports, which means it can no longer be installed on your iPhone due to a \"server-side software verification check.\" That's pretty normal when newer versions are available to download.\nBut don't expect to see iOS 19 soon — or ever. Instead, Apple is skipping the numbering ahead to iOS 26 next month. The company has decided to line up its iOS version numbers with a year-based system, similar to car model years. So while iOS and its sibling operating systems will be released in late 2025, they're all designated \"26\" to reflect the year ahead. \nIt's official, we're moving to iOS 26. (Apple)\nWhat is Liquid Glass design?\nLet's be honest. Out of everything announced at WWDC this year, the new Liquid Glass design was the star of the show. The iPhone's home and lock screens have looked pretty much the same year after year — the last exciting thing (in my opinion) was the option to add your own aesthetic to your home screen by customizing your apps and widgets. So seeing the home and lock screens' new facelift is refreshing.\nSo what exactly is Liquid Glass? Apple calls it a \"new translucent material\" since, well, the apps and widgets are clear. However, the screen can still adapt to dark and light modes, depending on surroundings. You'll also notice buttons with a new floating design in several apps, like Phone and Maps. They're designed to be less distracting than the current buttons, but are still easy to see. While the design overhaul has proven to be controversial since its announcement, some — including Engadget's own Devindra Hardawar — like the new direction, even if it's somewhat reminiscent of Microsoft's translucent Windows Vista Aero designs from nearly twenty years ago.\nThat said, as of the release of the iOS 26 beta 2, Apple has already incorporated some user feedback into the design, dialing back the transparency in at least some places. And while it will continue to evolve, Apple users won't be able to escape it: Liquid Glass was designed to make all of Apple's OSes more cohesive. Here's a look at how the translucent aesthetic will look with the new macOS Tahoe 26 on your desktop.\nWhat are the new and notable features of iOS 26?\niOS 26 has a laundry list of new features. Among the most worthwhile:\nPhone app redesign: You'll finally be able to scroll through contacts, recent calls and voicemail messages all on one screen. It also comes with a new feature called Hold Assist that'll notify you when an agent comes to the phone so you can avoid the elevator music and continue on with other tasks.\nLive Translation in Phone, FaceTime and Messages: iOS 26 is bringing the ability to have a conversation via phone call or text message with someone who speaks another language. Live Translation will translate your conversation in real time, which results in some stop-and-go interactions in the examples Apple shared during its presentation.\nPolls in group chats: Tired of sorting through what seems like hundreds of messages in your group chat? You and your friends will soon be able to create polls in group messages for deciding things like which brunch spot you're eating at or whose car you're taking on a road trip.\nFiltering unknown senders in Messages: If you haven't received spam texts about unpaid tolls or other citations, you're lucky. For those of us who have, those annoying messages will soon be filtered away in a separate folder.\nVisual Intelligence: Similar to a reverse Google image search, this new feature will allow you to search for anything that's on your iPhone screen. For instance, if you spot a pair of shoes someone is wearing in an Instagram photo, you can screenshot it and use Visual Intelligence to find those shoes (or similar ones) online.\nPhotos tabs are back: For anyone who's still frustrated with the Photos changes made last year, you'll be happy to know that your tabs are coming back. Library and Collections will have their own separate spaces so you don't have to scroll to infinity to find what you're looking for.\nFaceTime \"Communication Safety\" feature: A newer addition to iOS 26 appears to be the FaceTime \"Communication Safety\" feature that pauses communications if and when nudity is detected. The feature appears to be a child safety feature that uses on-device detection, thus obviating any cloud-based privacy issues. \nNew lock screen options: The iPhone lock screen gets more customizable in iOS 26, with a cooler clock, 3D wallpaper effects, more widgets and better focus mode options. \nApple's Hold Assist will be nifty for those pesky services that put you on hold for 10 or more minutes. (Apple)\nNew changes coming to iPadOS 26\nYour iPad isn't getting left behind when it comes to big updates. Here's what's coming this fall.\nMultitasking and real windowing: When you download the newest update, you'll be able to have multiple apps running on your screen at the same time. Once you open an app, it'll appear on your screen as normal but you'll be able to resize and move it across your screen to make room for other apps. This feature is optional so you can turn it off if you don't like it.\nVisual update: Along with the other new OSes, iPadOS 26 is coming with the Liquid Glass aesthetic. This new look will appear on the lock and home screens, as well as the drop-down menus.\nNew menu bar: When you swipe down on your screen, the new menu bar will appear with options like File, Edit, Windows and more. There's also a search option if you're looking for something specific.\nCheck out our first impressions of iPadOS 26. \nWhat about AirPods?\nAirPods are also getting updated with iOS 26. Here are some of the more notable functions.\nEnhanced audio recording: Apple calls this \"studio-quality\" audio recording, and with it, you'll notice more clarity while in noisy environments.\nCamera remote control: Using this, you can take a photo or start and stop video recording with just one press on your AirPods. When taking photos, you'll get a three-second countdown before your iPhone or iPad snaps the picture.\nLive translation feature: While not officially announced or confirmed, it appears that the long-rumored live translation for AirPods could be coming with iOS 26. The evidence comes from a system asset spotted in the in iOS 26 beta showing a gesture that's triggered by pressing both earbud stems at the same time. The photo also shows words in several different languages. \nHeart rate monitoring (rumored for now): Bloomberg's Mark Gurman believes Apple will introduce new AirPods Pro earbuds this year, which could have heart rate monitoring. It would work with Apple's Health app and other fitness apps that track heart rates.\nWill Siri get an update?\nSiri is in a holding pattern. Apple has previously specified that its smarter voice assistant — first promised at WWDC 2024 — is delayed until some point \"in the coming year,\" so you shouldn't expect any major changes in the current betas. But there are reports that Apple is aiming to give Siri a bigger brain transplant by basing it on third-party artificial intelligence models like OpenAI's ChatGPT or Anthropic's Claude, which could make 2026 a pivotal year. The company is also reportedly working on a \"stripped-down\" AI chatbot to rival ChatGPT.\nWhich iPhones will be able to upgrade to iOS 26?\nA few iPhone models that run the current version of iOS — iPhone XR, XS and XS Max — won't be compatible with the latest upgrade. But any iPhones released in 2019 or later will be eligible for the iOS 26 update.\n\niPhone SE (second generation or later)\niPhone 11\niPhone 11 Pro\niPhone 11 Pro Max\niPhone 12\niPhone 12 mini\niPhone 12 Pro\niPhone 12 Pro Max\niPhone 13\niPhone 13 mini\niPhone 13 Pro\niPhone 13 Pro Max\niPhone 14\niPhone 14 Plus\niPhone 14 Pro\niPhone 14 Pro Max\niPhone 15\niPhone 15 Plus\niPhone 15 Pro\niPhone 15 Pro Max\niPhone 16\niPhone 16 Plus\niPhone 16 Pro\niPhone 16 Pro Max\niPhone 16e\n\nNot listed here are the presumed new iPhone 17 models (or maybe iPhone 26?) that are all but certain to be announced and released in September. \nHow to install iOS 26 beta\nThe iOS 26 public beta is now available to download via the Apple Beta Software Program. If you're not already a member, you'll need to sign up to try out all the latest features. Just visit beta.apple.com and sign up with your phone number or email address. It's free.\nOnce you're in, you can install it by going to Settings > General > Software Update and selecting iOS 26 public beta. \nA word of caution: Don't sign up with your main iPhone unless you're OK with any risks that occur with using an OS that isn't finalized.\nWhen will the final version of iOS 26 be released?\niOS 26 will be released to the public this fall. It usually comes in September, within a week of the Apple iPhone event. Last year, it rolled out to iPhone users on September 16 — exactly one week after the iPhone 16 lineup was announced. Since the iPhone 17 event falls on September 9 this year, it's possible the downloads will hit our phones on September 16.\nIf you're more interested in the Apple Intelligence features coming, here's everything Apple revealed for iOS, macOS and more during WWDC. Also, check out how iOS 26 screenshots could be an intriguing preview of Apple's delayed Siri rework.\nUpdate, August 29: Added new section about Siri and a link to what's new with the iOS 26 Camera app.\nUpdate, August 27: Added the official iPhone 17 event date, as well as the potential iOS 26 release.\nUpdate, August 25: Added a rumor about new AirPods Pro having heart rate monitoring.\nUpdate, August 22: Noted that Apple has officially stopped signing iOS 18.6.\nUpdate, August 20: Noted that iOS 26 public beta 4 and iOS 18.6.2 are now available to download.\nUpdate, August 18: Added details about a potential iOS 18.6 update.\nUpdate, August 15: Added to link to what to expect at the Apple iPhone event and details about what's available in the iOS 26 screenshots editor.\nUpdate, August 13: Added new AirPods detail spotted in the iOS 26 beta.\nUpdate, August 11: Noted that iOS 26 developer beta has hit beta 6. \nUpdate, August 8: Added new features coming with iPadOS 26 and AirPods.\nUpdate, August 6: Noted the release of iOS 26 beta 5 and the new bouncy feature on passcode screen and Control Center.\nUpdate, August 4: Noted that Apple is reportedly working on a ChatGPT rival.\nUpdate, August 1: Added quote from Tim Cook about iOS 26.\nUpdate, July 31: Noted that iOS 18.6 is now available. \nUpdate, July 24: Noted the iOS 26 public beta is now available.\nUpdate, July 3: Noted new FaceTime feature found in the developer beta.\nUpdate, June 30: Noted ongoing iOS 18 releases, and reports that Apple is considering additional external LLMs for Siri. \nUpdate, June 25: Noted changes added in iOS 26 beta 2. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/apple-ios-26-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-new-features-in-the-upcoming-iphone-update-135749557.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Despite some fallout between President Trump and Elon Musk, the White House appears to still be in Musk’s corner. Wired is reporting, based on documents obtained by the outlet, that the White House allegedly directed leadership at the General Services Administration (GSA) to include xAI's Grok on its list of approved AI vendors.\nxAI is owned by Elon Musk and was not included in the slew of approvals the GSA issued in August that saw the agency add OpenAI, Google and Anthropic to its list of vendors. In emails sent last week and published by Wired, agency leadership demands xAI's products be included. \"Team: Grok/xAI needs to go back on the schedule ASAP per the WH,\" writes Josh Gruenbaum, commissioner of the Federal Acquisition Service, one of the branches of the GSA. “Should be all of their products we had previously (3 & 4),” likely referring to Grok 3 and Grok 4, which are iterations of xAI's LLM chatbot.\nCarahsoft, a major government contractor that resells technology from third-party firms, is mentioned. \"Can someone get with Carahsoft on this immediately and please confirm?\" wrote Gruenbaum. According to Wired, Carahsoft's contract was modified to include xAI earlier this week. As of Friday morning, both Grok 3 and Grok 4 are available on GSA Advantage, an online marketplace where government agencies can purchase products and services.\nxAI announced a version of Grok for US government agencies in July, when it appeared that GSA approval for the chatbot was all but certain. Shortly beforehand, the chatbot went off the rails and started spouting Nazi propaganda and antisemitic rhetoric while dubbing itself \"MechaHitler.\" This came in the wake of Musk and Trump's public spat over the president's spending bill, after which GSA approval of Grok seemed to stall. Why the change in directive now is unclear.\nThere were no details in the reporting regarding pricing or whether xAI will be offering discounted services to the federal government. Earlier this month, both OpenAI and Anthropic began offering their large language models to federal agencies for just $1 in an effort to drive adoption among the government workforce. xAI still holds a $200 million contract with the Pentagon to develop AI workflows within the US Department of Defense.\nThese AI models have been in the hot seat lately as increasingly disturbing cases of hallucinations and errant behavior have arisen. Just this week, OpenAI is facing a wrongful death lawsuit alleging that ChatGPT spent months discussing and ultimately enabling the suicide of a teen boy.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/the-white-house-reportedly-ordered-xais-grok-to-be-approved-for-government-use-165625891.html?src=rss",

Wired is reporting , based on documents obtained by the outlet, that the White House allegedly directed leadership at the General Services Administration (GSA) to include xAI's Grok on its list of approved AI vendors. In emails sent last week and published by Wired, agency leadership demands xAI's products be included. “Should be all of their products we had previously (3 & 4),” likely referring to Grok 3 and Grok 4, which are iterations of xAI's LLM chatbot. \"Can someone get with Carahsoft on this immediately and please confirm?\" As of Friday morning, both Grok 3 and Grok 4 are available on GSA Advantage, an online marketplace where government agencies can purchase products and services. xAI announced a version of Grok for US government agencies in July, when it appeared that GSA approval for the chatbot was all but certain . Shortly beforehand, the chatbot went off the rails and started spouting Nazi propaganda and antisemitic rhetoric while dubbing itself \"MechaHitler.\" This came in the wake of Musk and Trump's public spat over the president's spending bill, after which GSA approval of Grok seemed to stall . Earlier this month, both OpenAI and Anthropic began offering their large language models to federal agencies for just $1 in an effort to drive adoption among the government workforce."

    "full_text": "According to a legal filing seen by the Financial Times, the UK Home Office wanted backdoor access to standard iCloud services in addition to those secured with the highest level of encryption. Just last week, President Donald Trump's Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard said that the UK and US had reached a deal, which had resulted in the UK dropping its request to Apple. The US government has taken particular interest in the UK's request, which was initially reported back in January, as it wouldn't simply provide access to data belonging to British citizens, but to all iCloud users globally. But in February, Apple pulled its Advanced Data Protection security tool for iCloud users in the UK, saying that it was \"gravely disappointed\" over having to make the move. In the legal filing seen by the Financial Times, the Home Office's request didn't just apply to data protected by ADP, but to all iCloud data, including \"categories of data stored within a cloud-based backup service.\" The UK government's request is enabled by the Investigatory Powers Act -- referred to by critics as the \"Snooper's Charter\" -- which is designed to help law enforcement investigate serious crimes such terrorism and child sexual abuse. \"Once you open a backdoor, you don't really have tight control of who walks through it,\" said Oli Buckley, professor of cybersecurity at the University of Loughborough. \"The request from the Home Office doesn't seem to be just asking Apple to leave a spare key out for them. Instead, they are effectively asking them to ensure every house on the street uses the same key.\" This might make it convenient for investigators, he added, but it puts everyone at risk in the process."

(Hey veteran PC builders: this looks easier than MXM modules, right?) This is the proof point we’ve been waiting for. We couldn’t run benchmarks, only basic gameplay samples to show the card was working. (Framework claims the Nvidia card should be a 30 to 40 percent upgrade over the existing AMD one; games did run, and didn’t seem to have obvious issues at 1440p and high settings.) Also, I wasn’t able to upgrade quite from scratch. I actually hauled my original Framework Laptop 16 review unit to San Francisco to see if I could turn that one into a new Nvidia laptop, but CEO Nirav Patel told me it would need software updates, including at least one new BIOS version, which weren’t fully ready yet. 221W from Framework’s new 240W PD 3.1 adapter. When I came back 15 or so minutes later, the new power adapter was only warm, not hot — comfortable to pick up and hold. I’ll have a video on that next week."

    "full_text": "Decentralized social network Mastodon says it can’t comply with Mississippi’s age verification law — the same law that saw rival Bluesky pull out of the state — because it doesn’t have the means to do so. The social nonprofit explains that Mastodon doesn’t track its users, which makes it difficult to enforce such legislation. “And this is why real decentralization matters,” said Rochko. Masnick pushed back, questioning why Mastodon’s individual servers, like the one Rochko runs at mastodon.social, would not also be subject to the same $10,000 per user fines for noncompliance with the law. On Friday, however, the nonprofit shared a statement with TechCrunch to clarify its position, saying that while Mastodon’s own servers specify a minimum age of 16 to sign up for its services, it does not “have the means to apply age verification” to its services. That is, the Mastodon software doesn’t support it. The Mastodon 4.4 release in July 2025 added the ability to specify a minimum age for sign-up and other legal features for handling terms of service, partly in response to increased regulation around these areas. That means individual server owners have to decide for themselves if they believe an age verification component is a necessary addition. The nonprofit says Mastodon is currently unable to provide “direct or operational assistance” to the broader set of Mastodon server operators. Mastodon notes that it’s “not tracking, or able to comment on, the policies and operations of individual servers that run Mastodon.”"

While it is more expensive than the models listed above, it's less expensive than other models that offer as many features as it does. This washing machine offers 5 cubic feet of space, is smart-technology enabled and comes with an impressive range of 12 standard cycles, including a quick wash cycle and a sanitize function for items such as towels and gym clothes that can commonly attract mildew through moisture. A steam option is also available to help vaporize deep stains, an automatic detergent dispenser measures for you based on the size of the load, and a venting feature allows the washing machine to dry out between cycles even with its door closed. In a sea of otherwise white, black, and stainless steel machines, this GE washer is also, refreshingly, navy blue. Because of the many features, this model sports a more complex control panel -- a combination of digital and manual dials -- but one I found intuitive and easy to adjust. It has a sleek, modern look and is available in white or sapphire blue."

The company is also making reductions in its facilities, though it does not plan to close any offices. Will cut roughly 5% of its current workforce in a new efficiency drive to increase profitability and growth. Laid off more employees in a new effort to cut costs, though the total number is unknown. Cut 51 jobs in its San Francisco headquarters, according to state filings with the Employment Development Department."

    "summary": "Labor Day may bring about the unofficial end to summer, but on the bright side, it can be a good time to save on tech. While seasonal holidays like Memorial Day and Labor Day aren’t the boon for tech deals as Prime Day or Black Friday can be, you can still find some good deals across the web. That’s particularly true if you’re going back to school soon, or are shopping for someone imminently heading back to campus.Engadget has you covered for all of the best Labor Day sales on tech. Since this time of year does overlap with the back-to-school season, students should be first in line to check out these deals. If you need some new gadgets for college, or refreshed tech to help you out in your first job after graduating, now's the time to see if you can get it for less. Student discounts are handy and exclusive to those who can prove their student status, but the good thing about Labor Day sales is that anyone can take advantage of them — student ID not required.\nBest Labor Day sales: Engadget's top picks\n \nApple MacBook Air (13-inch, M4) for $799 ($200 off): Apple's latest MacBook Air is the top pick in our guide to the best laptops, and it earned a score of 92 in our review. The M4 model isn't a major refresh overall, but that's not a bad thing — the design remains exceptionally thin, light and well-built, with long battery life and a top-notch keyboard and trackpad. Now it's a bit faster thanks to the updated chipset. \nApple iPad (11-inch, A16) for $299 ($50 off): Apple's entry-level iPad is, unsurprisingly, the best iPad option for those on a budget. It has solid performance thanks to the A16 chipset, 128GB of storage in the base model and good battery life.\nApple iPad Air (11-inch, M3) for $449 ($150 off): The latest iPad Air is a relatively minor update; the only big addition is a more powerful M3 chip. However, we still recommend this iPad over the base model in our iPad buying guide: Its display is more color-rich and better at fending off glare, its speakers are more robust, it works with Apple’s best accessories and its performance should hold up better in the years ahead.\nSony WH-CH520 wireless headphones for $38 (46 percent off): Sony makes headphones at all price ranges, and the WH-CH520 provides good sound quality and long battery life at an affordable price. They support custom EQ with Sony's mobile app, multipoint connectivity, a built-in microphone and up to 50 hours of battery life.\nAnker Laptop Power Bank (25K, 100W) for $95 (30 percent off): One of our top picks for the best power banks, this 25K brick from Anker has two built-in USB-C cables so you never have to remember to bring one with you. It has a durable build and delivers a speedy charge to all devices, and as the name implies, it can handle powering up items as big as a laptop.\nEufy 11S Max robot vacuum for $159 (43 percent off): This model is one of our favorite budget robot vacuums thanks to its slim design that lets you get underneath furniture more easily and strong suction power for its size. Note that it does not have Wi-Fi connectivity, but it comes with a remote that lets you control the robot to your liking.\nShark AI Ultra robot vacuum for $298 (50 percent off): This Shark robot vacuum is a version of one of our favorites and it comes with a auto-empty base that can hold up to 60 days worth of debris. It has strong suction power and home mapping capabilities, so you can tailor cleaning jobs to your liking in addition to putting the robot on a cleaning schedule.\nDyson 360 Vis Nav robot vacuum for $500 ($500 off): Dyson made one of the most impressive robovacs with the 360 Vis Nav. It has some of the strongest suction power of any robot vacuum I've tried, and its impressive obstacle avoidance allows it to move around furniture and other objects with basically not intervention from humans necessary.\nGoogle Pixel 10 smartphone + $100 Amazon gift card for $799 ($100 off): More of a pre-order deal than a Labor Day deal, this bundle includes a free gift card when you order the latest Google Pixel phone in advance. You'll find different gift card deals at Amazon depending on which phone you go with: the Pixel 10 Pro and Pro XL have a $200 gift cards included, while the Pixel 10 Pro Fold comes with a free $300 gift card.\nAmazon Kindle Colorsoft (16GB) for $220 ($30 off): This is the latest version of Amazon's color ereader that has half of the storage of the original model, but otherwise functions the same. That makes it a little cheaper to start off, but you're still getting a 7-inch color e-paper display, full access to the Kindle shop and a waterproof design. We also appreciate that the Colorsoft comes with no lockscreen ads by default.\nBlink Outdoor 4 security cameras (3 camera system) for $100 (47 percent off): Some of our favorite security cameras, Blink Outdoor 4 devices support 1080p video, two-way talk, motion alerts and night vision. The most convenient thing about these is that they're totally wireless and run on AA batteries that can last up to two years before you need to replace them. That combined with their weather-proof design allows you to place them both inside and outside.\nCosori 9-in-1 air fryer for $90 (25 percent off): One of our picks for the best air fryers, this Cosori model has a spacious six-quart cooking basket and nine prep modes to choose from. In our testing, it consistently crisped up all kinds of foods, from frozen appetizers to raw proteins, and it has a nifty safety feature with its built-in basket release button.\nESPN Unlimited with Disney+ and Hulu (with ads) for $30/month ($6/month off): ESPN’s new streaming service is officially available now, and new subscribers can get Disney+ and Hulu included for one year when they sign up. The regular price of the new ESPN Unlimited plan is $30 per month, but this bundle offer throws in Disney+ and Hulu (with ads) for one year at no extra cost. If you want to break it down, you’re essentially getting each of the three services for $10 monthly with this offer.\nNordVPN deal — Get up to 77 percent off two-year plans: Most of NordVPN's two-year plans are on sale right now. You'll get 77 percent off the Prime tier, bringing the price down to $189 for 27 months of service (Nord throws in an extra three months for free). Arguably the best plan for most people is the Plus tier, which is 73 percent off and down to $108 for the 27-month term.\nMasterClass deal — Get 50 percent off one-year subscriptions: You can sign up for one year of MasterClass access for as low as $5 per month thanks to this sale that runs through September 1. A subscription lets you watch hundreds of online video classes taught by experts in their fields, and subject matter ranges from writing to cooking to sports.\nBest Labor Day sales on tech\n\nApple 24-inch iMac (M4) for $1,149 ($150 off)\n8Bitdo Ultimate 2C Wired Controller for $15 (25 percent off)\nXbox wireless gaming controller for $54 (17 percent off)\nRoku Ultra streamer for $79 (21 percent off)\nSony WH-1000XM4 wireless headphones for $198 (43 percent off)\nGovee RGBIC Floor Lamp Basic for $60 (40 percent off)\nAmazon Fire Max 11 tablet for $175 (24 percent off)\nNothing Headphones (1) for $269 ($30 off)\n\nMore Labor Day sales\n\nAmazon Labor Day sale: Get up to 40 percent off headphones, earbuds, tech accessories and more\nBest Buy Labor Day sale: Get up to 50 percent off appliances, laptops, TVs, smartphones and more\nWalmart Labor Day sale: Save hundreds on electronics including TVs, laptops, headphones and more\nDyson Labor Day sale: Save up to $500 on vacuums, hair care and more\nSonos Labor Day sale: Save up to 25 percent on headphones and speakers\nTherabody Labor Day sale: Save up to $150 on percussion massage guns and more\nOoni Labor Day sale: Get 20 percent off the Koda 2 Max and save on other pizza ovens\nSolo Stove Labor Day sale: Get 20 percent off fire pits and 15 percent off select accessories\nMeater Labor Day sale: Get up to 27 percent off smart meat thermometers\n\nFollow @EngadgetDeals on X for the latest tech deals and buying advice.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-labor-day-sales-for-2025-get-up-to-50-percent-off-gear-from-apple-dyson-sony-and-others-120049238.html?src=rss",

    "full_text": "Khalid Ashmawy remembers the first time he wired money home while studying in Europe. He had just received his monthly stipend as a master’s student in Stuttgart and wanted to send part of it back to his family in Cairo. It was usually a slow and expensive process, he recalled. “It’s a problem I have personally experienced and one that resonates with a lot of people who want to send money back home quickly and efficiently.” A scholarship took him to Europe, where he completed two master’s degrees in Germany and Switzerland. Leaving Huspy gave him space to reflect on his own immigrant journey. Egypt is one of the world’s largest remittance markets, receiving nearly $30 billion in inflows annually. “We’ve really tailored this experience for people from the region,” said Ashmawy. YC has historically invested in startups solving hard financial infrastructure problems, from Stripe to Coinbase. Similarly, remittances are one of the most entrenched pain points in global finance and one of the accelerator’s consistent focus areas when backing startups from emerging markets (case in point: LemFi and Aspora) before its recent AI tilt."

    "full_text": "The animated musical’s story about a trio of pop stars tasked with protecting humanity from monsters is familiar, but refreshingly different and infinitely more stylish than other narratives like it. And as Netflix sets out to turn the Huntr/x girls into franchise stars with a sequel, the streamer needs a thoughtful strategy if it wants to conjure up this kind of movie magic again. Netflix would not be in such an enviable position right now if it had not entered an agreement with Sony back in 2021 giving it the exclusive US streaming rights to Sony Pictures Entertainment’s (SPE) big-screen features following their theatrical runs and home entertainment releases. As part of the deal Sony could still sell direct-to-streaming movies to other platforms. But as Matt Belloni at Puck points out, 2021 was a very different time for the entertainment industry. The deal gave Sony a way to keep putting movies out and minimize pandemic-related layoffs. And in exchange for footing all $100 million of KPop Demon Hunters’ production costs and paying Sony an extra $25 million fee, Netflix got to keep the film’s most profitable rights, including merchandising. It’s funny to think of Sony execs shouting up at the sky and kicking themselves as Netflix soaks up all the adulation for producing one of this year’s best features. But KPop Demon Hunters feels like the perfect example of a movie benefiting from this current moment of pop culture consumption where many people pride themselves on discovering things that they unexpectedly love, and then rushing to tell as many people as they can about said things. But the key takeaway from Frozen (2013) and Frozen 2 (2019) might just be that Netflix doesn’t need to rush the next chapter of KPop Demon Hunters’ story."

    "summary": "Google has started rolling out customizable calling cards for the beta versions of its Android Contacts and Phone apps. Android Authority found clues that the company was working on the feature back in July when it did an APK teardown. Now, you can give it a try if you decide to install the beta versions of the apps. As the publication notes, Google's implementation is the direct opposite of Apple's. On iOS, your set your own photo and name that you want to show up on other people's phones when you call them. You cannot alter other people's Contact Posters, as Apple calls the feature. Meanwhile, on Android, you can't make your own calling card. The feature instead gives you a way to set a photo and a name for your contacts that show up on your screen when they call you. \nIf you do have access to the beta Contacts app for Android, you'll now see a note that says \"Try adding a calling card\" when you view a contact's details. From there, you can choose a photo you have of that contact from your gallery or take a new one of them with your camera. You can also adjust the font type and color for their name. Whenever they call, that calling card will take over your phone screen. If this sounds nothing new to you, it may be because Samsung has had a profile card feature for a while now that works just like Google's implementation. It's already widely available and accessible from your contacts' profile pages. \nUpdate, August 29 2025, 10:11AM ET: Google has announced that its Calling Cards feature is now rolling out to Android users worldwide. Once you’ve updated your Google Phone app to version v188, you’ll be able to set a full-screen picture that appears for all outgoing and incoming calls.

From there, you can choose a photo you have of that contact from your gallery or take a new one of them with your camera. You can also adjust the font type and color for their name. Whenever they call, that calling card will take over your phone screen. If this sounds nothing new to you, it may be because Samsung has had a profile card feature for a while now that works just like Google's implementation. It's already widely available and accessible from your contacts' profile pages. Once you’ve updated your Google Phone app to version v188, you’ll be able to set a full-screen picture that appears for all outgoing and incoming calls. Google says the feature will be made available in phases, so you might not get it straight away."

Google announced the deal in a YouTube blog post. \"We're happy to share that we've reached an agreement with Fox to keep their content on YouTube TV, preserve the value of our service for our subscribers and offer more flexibility in the future,\" it said. \"This means that Fox channels, including the Fox Broadcast Network, Fox News, and Fox Sports, remain available for our subscribers along with 100+ channels and football fans will not miss any of the action this weekend.\" With the first big Saturday of college football this weekend -- starting with No. 1 Texas facing off against No. 3 Ohio State at noon on Fox -- and the first Sunday of NFL football next weekend, the pressure was on for Google and Fox to get a deal done. And after a short-term extension that allowed negotiations to extend past a Wednesday deadline, the two parties were able to renew their contract without any disruption in service. Enjoy the football this weekend, folks. Read more: How to Watch NFL Games Without Cable in 2025"

Two days after Anthropic's victory, Meta won a similar case under fair use. Alsup's ruling also revealed that Anthropic systematically acquired and destroyed thousands of used books to scan them into a private, digitized library for AI training. If the case were litigated through trial and appeal, it could last another two years or more.\" Don't miss any of our unbiased tech content and lab-based reviews. There are still big questions about how copyright law should be applied in the age of AI.

With Supernatural's heart rate tracking support via a phone app that connects to devices like Apple Watch, it lets me keep an eye on intensity. Mixed reality modes can work functionally to keep me aware of my environment more safely. I have bigger issues with how slowly software and services are evolving, though. Meta hasn't made any headway with folding in more organic support for watches or fitness apps, either. If Meta doesn't move fast here, it could find itself lapped by the competition. Apple's likely waiting for more affordable and lighter-weight headsets before making that move, but I'd be absolutely shocked if it didn't happen. The Quest 3 and 3S design is compact, but it's still not ideally constructed for fitness. And whatever company can ace that experience will have a killer pitch to the people who already spend hundreds or even thousands on fitness equipment and gyms, who might find it a lot more justifiable to spend up than would-be VR gamers or movie watchers."

But make no mistake: Good Apple deals are usually out there. To make them a bit easier to find, we're keeping a running list of the best Apple deals on AirPods, MacBooks, iPads and more that you can shop right now. \nJust note that you’ll almost always find the best Apple deals from retailers like Amazon, Best Buy, Walmart, Target and the like, not from Apple's own online store. Unless you shop refurbished, you’ll always pay top dollar buying direct (though for some items like iPhones, that might be the best route to take). \nBest iPad deals\n \nApple iPad Air 13-inch (M3) for $649 ($150 off): Engadget's Nate Ingraham gave the 13-inch iPad Air a score of 89 when it was released in March. It has a bigger and slightly brighter display than its 11-inch counterpart; otherwise, the two slates are the same. If you plan to keep your iPad hooked up to a keyboard, the extra screen space is lovely for taking in movies and multitasking for work. This is another new low, and it applies to various color options and storage configs.\nApple iPad mini (A17 Pro) for $399 ($100 off): The iPad mini is exactly what it sounds like: the smaller iPad. This latest iteration has an improved A17 Pro chip — which is enough to support Apple Intelligence — along with 128GB of storage in the base model and Apple Pencil Pro support. As before, you’d buy it if you value the smaller 8.3-inch display and want a tablet you can more easily hold with one hand. This deal is $20 more than the lowest price we've tracked. Also at Target and Best Buy.\nApple iPad Pro 11-inch (M4) for $895 ($105 off): The iPad Pro is much more tablet than most people need, but it’s the ultimate iPad for those who can stomach its price tag. It’s wonderfully thin, its OLED display is one of the best we’ve seen on a consumer device and its M4 chip can handle virtually anything you’d ever do on an iPad. It’s also the only Apple tablet with Face ID, plus it has a better speaker setup than the iPad Air. We gave it a score of 84 in our review, with the only real drawback being its price. Also at BJ's for $45 less, if you have a membership there.\nApple iPad Pro 13-inch (M4) for $1,099 ($200 off): The 13-inch iPad Pro has all the same specs as the 11-inch model, only it's bigger and more expensive. Again, it may be worth the extra cost if you plan to multitask regularly or just want more display area for enjoying movies. Also at Target and Best Buy.\nBest AirPods deals\n \nBest Mac deals\n \nApple MacBook Air (15-inch, M4) for $999 ($200 off): The 15-inch MacBook Air is nearly identical to the smaller version but features more robust speakers and a more spacious trackpad alongside its roomier display. $999 is the lowest price we've tracked.\nApple MacBook Pro (14-inch, M4 Pro) for $1,699 ($300 off): The MacBook Pro goes beyond most people’s needs, but it remains a powerhouse for coders, media editors or anyone else with especially demanding workloads. We gave it a score of 92 last November. Just keep in mind that it’s heavier than the MacBook Air and that it still lacks a standard USB-A port. Also at Best Buy.\nApple iMac (24-inch, M4) for $1,149 ($150 off): For an all-in-one solution, the M4 iMac is a good pick thanks to its powerful performance, standard 16GB of RAM and improved webcam. Just note that it only comes in the 24-inch screen size option. We've seen this deal in the past, and it’s not quite an all-time low, but it's a decent savings compared to buying from Apple directly.\nBest Apple Watch deals\n \nApple Watch SE (GPS, 40mm) for $169 ($80 off): As with the more premium models, we wouldn’t be surprised to see an update to Apple’s budget smartwatch sometime soon (and we have a few suggestions on the matter). But thanks to discounts like this, the Apple Watch SE has turned out to be the most affordable way to get an iPhone companion for your wrist. Despite a lackluster screen and limited extra features, it handles the basics well. Also at Walmart.\nBest Apple accessories deals\n \nApple Pencil Pro for $99 ($30 off): The highest-end option in Apple’s confusing stylus lineup, the Pencil Pro supports pressure sensitivity, wireless charging, tilt detection, haptic feedback and support for Apple’s double tap and squeeze gestures, among other perks. It’s a lovely tool for more intricate sketching and note-taking, but the catch is that it’s only compatible with the M4 iPad Pro, M2 and M3 iPad Air and most recent iPad mini. We've seen this deal fairly often over the course of the year, but it's a decent discount compared to buying from Apple directly. Also at Walmart, Best Buy and Target.\nApple Pencil (USB-C) for $69 ($10 off): This more affordable Apple Pencil doesn’t support pressure sensitivity, but it still makes for a useful stylus for the basics. If you’re a casual note-taker and can live without wireless charging, you’ll save a few bucks by picking this one up. Also at Walmart, Best Buy and Target.\nRead more Apple coverage:\n\nThe best AirPods\nThe best Apple Watches\nThe best MacBooks\nThe best iPhones\nThe best iPads\n\nFollow @EngadgetDeals on X for the latest tech deals and buying advice.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/best-apple-deals-150020110.html?src=rss",
    "full_text": "It's no secret that Apple devices tend to be in particularly high demand. Unfortunately, that demand can make finding big discounts on Apple gadgets a bit harder than usual. Apple iPad Air 13-inch (M3) for $649 ($150 off): Engadget's Nate Ingraham gave the 13-inch iPad Air a score of 89 when it was released in March. We gave it a score of 84 in our review, with the only real drawback being its price. Also at BJ's for $45 less, if you have a membership there. Again, it may be worth the extra cost if you plan to multitask regularly or just want more display area for enjoying movies. Apple MacBook Air (15-inch, M4) for $999 ($200 off): The 15-inch MacBook Air is nearly identical to the smaller version but features more robust speakers and a more spacious trackpad alongside its roomier display. While the Series 10 is an iterative update, that’s not necessarily a bad thing. It still tracks workouts accurately and delivers alerts to your wrist efficiently, though we will almost certainly see a new Series 11 model by the end of the year if you're not in any rush. Despite a lackluster screen and limited extra features, it handles the basics well."

    "summary": "Finding the best wireless earbuds can make a huge difference in how you experience music, podcasts, calls and even daily commutes. Whether you're tuning out distractions on the train or taking work calls on the go, today’s wireless earbuds pack impressive audio quality and convenience into tiny, pocket-friendly forms. Many now offer excellent noise cancellation, smart ambient noise modes for staying aware of your surroundings and reliable noise isolation to help keep you focused — all without the hassle of wires.There’s a wide range of options available, from budget-friendly picks to premium models with advanced features like multi-device pairing, wireless charging cases and multiple mics for crystal-clear calls. No matter your price point, there’s a pair out there that can deliver great sound, comfort and functionality to match your needs.\nTable of contents\n\nBest wireless earbuds of 2025\nWhat to look for in the best wireless earbuds\nHow we test wireless earbuds \nOther wireless earbuds we tested\nWireless earbuds FAQs\n\nBest wireless earbuds of 2025\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhat to look for in the best wireless earbuds\nWhen it comes to shopping for earphones, the first thing to consider is design or wear style. Do you prefer a semi-open fit like AirPods or do you want something that completely closes off your ears? If you’re shopping for earbuds with active noise cancellation, you'll want the latter, but a case can be made for the former if you want to wear them all day or frequent places where you need to be tuned in to the ambient sounds. The overall shape of earbuds can determine whether you get a comfortable fit, so can the size and weight, so you’ll want to consider all that before deciding. And remember: audio companies aren’t perfect, so despite lots of research, the earbud shape they decided on may not fit you well. Don’t be afraid to return ill-fitting earbuds for something that’s more comfortable. \nAs wireless earbuds have become the norm, they’re now more reliable for basic things like consistent Bluetooth connectivity. Companies are still in a race to pack as much as they can into increasingly smaller designs. This typically means a longer list of features on the more premium sets of earbuds with basic functionality on the cheapest models. Carefully consider what you can’t live without when selecting your next earbuds, and make sure key items like automatic pausing and multipoint connectivity are on the spec sheet. You’ll also want to investigate the volume and touch controls as you’ll often have to sacrifice access to something else to make that adjustment via on-board taps or swipes. Some earbuds even offer app settings to tweak the audio profiles or firmware updates to improve performance over time.\nFor those in the Apple ecosystem, features like auto-pairing with devices, especially with AirPods Pro 2, can be an added advantage, while Android users may want to look for models that offer similar cross-device functionality.\nWhen it comes to battery life, the average set of earbuds lasts about five hours on a single charge. You can find sets that last longer, but this is likely enough to get you through a work day if you’re docking the buds during lunch or the occasional meeting. You’ll want to check on how many extra charges are available via the case and if it supports wireless charging.\nCompanies will also make lofty claims about call quality on wireless earbuds. Despite lots of promises, the reality is most earbuds still leave you sounding like you’re on speakerphone. There are some sets that deliver, but don’t get your hopes up unless reviews confirm the claims.\nSound can be subjective, so we recommend trying before you buy if at all possible. This is especially true if you're an audiophile. We understand this isn’t easy when most of us do a lot of shopping online, but trying on a set of earbuds and listening to them for a few minutes can save you from an expensive case of buyer's remorse. If a store doesn’t allow a quick demo, most retailers have return policies that will let you take earbuds back you don’t like. Of course, you have to be willing to temporarily part with funds in order to do this.\nWe also recommend paying attention to things like Spatial Audio, Dolby Atmos, 360 Reality Audio and other immersive formats. Not all earbuds support them, so you’ll want to make sure a perspective pair does if that sort of thing excites you, especially if you plan to use them for playback of high-quality audio.\nHow we test wireless earbuds\nThe primary way we test earbuds is to wear them as much as possible. We prefer to do this over a one- to two-week period, but sometimes embargoes don’t allow it. During this time, we listen to a mix of music and podcasts, while also using the earbuds to take both voice and video calls. Since battery life for earbuds is typically less than a full day, we drain the battery with looping music and the volume set at a comfortable level (usually around 75 percent).\nTo judge audio quality, we listen to a range of genres, noting any differences in the sound profile across the styles. We also test at both low and high volumes to check for consistency in the tuning. To assess call quality, we’ll record audio samples with the earbuds’ microphones as well as have third parties call us.\nWhen it comes to features, we do a thorough review of companion apps, testing each feature as we work through the software. Any holdovers from previous models are double checked for improvements or regression. If the earbuds we’re testing are an updated version of a previous model, we’ll spend time getting reacquainted with the older buds. Ditto for the closest competition for each new set of earbuds that we review.\nOther wireless Bluetooth earbuds we tested\nSony WF-C710N\nThe WF-C710N is a set of compact and comfy earbuds that offer several of Sony’s best features. While the ANC performance is above average for this price ($120), sound quality isn’t as good as the company’s slightly more expensive options. Battery life fell below stated figures and call performance isn’t good enough to use these buds for work.\nBeats Powerbeats Pro 2\nThe newest version of the Powerbeats Pro have an improved, comfortable design, balanced bass and new H2 chips and a heart rate sensor inside. But heart rate support is currently limited on iOS, and there's a possibility those capabilities make it onto the next AirPods Pro models.\nSamsung Galaxy Buds 3\nThe Galaxy Buds 3 combine ANC with an open-type design, which renders the noise-blocking abilities of the earbuds mostly useless. Still, there’s great low-end tone with ample bass when a track demands it. There are also lots of handy features, most of which require a Samsung phone. But at this price, there are better options from Google, Beats and Sony\nSennheiser Momentum Sport\nI really like the overall shape of the Momentum Sport earbuds. They’re more comfortable than the Momentum True Wireless 4 and fit in my ears better. What’s more, the body temperature and heart rate sensors work well, sending those stats to a variety of apps. However, that sport-tracking feature works best with Polar’s app and devices, so there’s that consideration. Also, the audio quality and ANC performance isn’t as good as the MTW4, and these earbuds are pricey.\nBeats Solo Buds\nThere’s a lot to like about the Solo Buds for $80. For me, the primary perk is they’re very comfortable to wear for long periods of time thanks to some thoughtful design considerations. You only get the basics here in terms of features and, as expected, the overall sound quality isn’t as good as the pricier models in the Beats lineup. You will get 18 hours of battery life though, since the company nixed the battery in the case and beefed up the listening time in the buds themselves.\nBose Ultra Open Earbuds\nBose created something very unique for this set of earbuds that allows you to stay in-tune with the world while listening to audio content. The clip-on design is very comfortable, but sound quality suffers due to the open-type fit, especially when it comes to bass and spatial audio.\nAudio-Technica ATH-TWX7\nThese stick buds have a compact design that’s comfortable to wear and the warm sound profile is great at times. However, overall audio performance is inconsistent and there’s no automatic pausing.\nMaster & Dynamic MW09\nRetooled audio, better ambient sound mode and reliable multipoint Bluetooth are the best things the MW09 has to offer. They’re expensive though, and you can find better ANC performance elsewhere.\nWireless earbud FAQs\nWhat is considered good battery life for true wireless earbuds?\nMost wireless earbuds will last five hours on a single charge, at the least. You can find some pairs that have even better battery life, lasting between six and eight hours before they need more juice. All of the best wireless earbuds come with a charging case, which will provide additional hours of battery life — but you'll have to return each bud to the case in order to charge them up.\nIs sound quality better on headphones or earbuds?\nComparing sound quality on earbuds and headphones is a bit like comparing apples and oranges. There are a lot of variables to consider and the differences in components make a direct comparison difficult. Personally, I prefer the audio quality from over-ear headphones, but I can tell you the sound from earbuds like Sennheiser’s Momentum True Wireless 3 is also outstanding.\nWhich wireless earbuds have the longest battery life?\nWith new models coming out all the time, tracking the hours of battery life for each this can be difficult to keep tabs on. The longest-lasting earbuds we’ve reviewed are Audio-Technica’s ATH-CKS5TW. The company states they last 15 hours, but the app was still showing 40 percent at that mark during our tests. The only downside is these earbuds debuted in 2019 and both technology and features have improved since. In terms of current models, Master & Dynamic’s MW08 offers 12 hours of use on a charge with ANC off (10 with ANC on) and JBL has multiple options with 10-hour batteries.\nWhat wireless earbuds are waterproof?\nThere are plenty of options these days when it comes to increased water resistance. To determine the level of protection, you’ll want to look for an IP (ingress protection) rating. The first number indicates intrusion protection from things like dust. The second number is the level of moisture protection and you’ll want to make sure that figure is 7 or higher. At this water-resistance rating, earbuds can withstand full immersion for up to 30 minutes in depths up to one meter (3.28 feet). If either of the IP numbers is an X, that means it doesn’t have any special protection. For example, a pair of wireless earbuds that are IPX7 wouldn’t be built to avoid dust intrusion, but they would be ok if you dropped them in shallow water.\nWhich earbuds stay in ears the best?\nA secure fit can vary wildly from person to person. All of our ears are different, so audio companies are designing their products to fit the most people they can with a single shape. This is why AirPods will easily fall out for some but stay put for others. Design touches like wing tips or fins typically come on fitness models and those elements can help keep things in place. You’ll likely just have to try earbuds on, and if they don’t fit well return them.\nWhat wireless earbuds work with PS5?\nPlayStation 5 doesn’t support Bluetooth audio without an adapter or dongle. Even Sony’s own gaming headsets come with a transmitter that connects to the console. There are universal options that allow you to use any headphones, headset or earbuds with a PS5. Once you have one, plug it into a USB port on the console and pair your earbuds with it.\nRecent updates\nMay 2025: Updated to ensure top picks and buying advice remain accurate.\nMarch 2025: Updated the top pick for the best sounding wireless earbuds - runner up.\nJanuary 2025: Updated the top pick for best sounding wireless earbuds.\nJuly 2024: Updated our list to include the Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/best-wireless-earbuds-120058222.html?src=rss",
    "full_text": "Sony still manages to pack in more features than anyone else too, including trademark ones like adaptive sound and Speak-to-Chat. You’ll also enjoy well over eight hours of battery life with ANC on and an IPX4 rating that will be good enough for workouts. What’s more, handy Speak-to-Chat is here and Adaptive Sound Control can automatically change settings based on activity or location. As wireless earbuds have become the norm, they’re now more reliable for basic things like consistent Bluetooth connectivity. You’ll want to check on how many extra charges are available via the case and if it supports wireless charging. There are some sets that deliver, but don’t get your hopes up unless reviews confirm the claims.

    "summary": "A virtual private network (VPN) can save you a lot of money if you use it right. By changing your virtual location, you can use one streaming service to see shows that might be scattered between three or four in your home country. You can also trawl the world for discounts that only show up in a few select regions. And of course, you can't put a price on the joy of taking back your online business from intrusive ads and trackers.\nVPN providers are all competing to boost their subscriber counts, so they frequently offer massive discounts to anyone willing to sign up for one or two years at a time. Most of the deals below fit into that category. Before you jump into the list, make sure you're OK with a longer-term commitment. \nBest VPN deals\n \nNordVPN — $83.43 for a two-year subscription with three months free (77 percent off): NordVPN gets the most important parts of a VPN right. It's fast, it doesn't leak any of your data and it's great at changing your virtual location. I noted in my NordVPN review that it always connects quickly and includes a support page that makes it easy to get live help. Although I'm sad to see it shutting down Meshnet, NordVPN still includes a lot of cool features, like servers that instantly connect you to Tor. This deal gives you 77 percent off the two-year plan, which also comes with three extra months — but there's no expiration date, so you have a little time for comparison shopping.\nExpressVPN — $85.42 for a two-year subscription with four months free (61 percent off): This is one of the best VPNs, especially for new users, who will find its apps and website headache-free on all platforms. In tests for my ExpressVPN review, it dropped my download speeds by less than 7 percent and successfully changed my virtual location 14 out of 15 times. In short, it's an all-around excellent service that only suffers from being a little overpriced — which is why I'm so excited whenever I find it offering a decent deal. This deal, which gets you 28 months of ExpressVPN service, represents a 61 percent savings. It's the lowest I've seen ExpressVPN go in some time, though like NordVPN, it's not on a ticking clock.\nSurfshark Starter — $53.73 for a two-year subscription with three months free (87 percent off): This is the \"basic\" level of Surfshark, but it includes the entire VPN; everything on Surfshark One is an extra perk. With this subscription, you'll get some of the most envelope-pushing features in the VPN world right now. Surfshark has a more closely connected server network than most VPNs, so it can rotate your IP constantly to help you evade detection — it even lets you choose your own entry and exit nodes for a double-hop connection. That all comes with a near-invisible impact on download speeds. With this year-round deal, you can save 87 percent on 27 months of Surfshark.\nSurfshark One — $61.83 for a two-year subscription with three months free (87 percent off): A VPN is great, but it's not enough to protect your data all on its own. Surfshark One adds several apps that boost your security beyond just VPN service, including Surfshark Antivirus (scans devices and downloads for malware), Surfshark Alert (alerts you whenever your sensitive information shows up in a data breach) and Surfshark Search (a private search engine with no ads or activity tracking). This evergreen deal gives you 87 percent off all those features. If you bump up to Surfshark One+, you'll also get data removal through Incogni, but the price jumps enough that it's not quite worthwhile in my eyes.\nCyberGhost — $56.94 for a two-year subscription with two months free (83 percent off): CyberGhost has some of the best automation you'll see on any VPN. With its Smart Rules system, you can determine how its apps respond to different types of Wi-Fi networks, with exceptions for specific networks you know by name. Typically, you can set it to auto-connect, disconnect or send you a message asking what to do. CyberGhost's other best feature is its streaming servers — while it's not totally clear what it does to optimize them, I've found both better video quality and more consistent unblocking when I use them on streaming sites. Currently, you can get 26 months of CyberGhost for 83 percent off the usual price.\nPrivate Internet Access — $79 for a three-year subscription with three months free (83 percent off): It's a bit hard to find (the link at the start of this paragraph includes the coupon), but Private Internet Access (PIA) is giving out the best available price right now on a VPN I'd recommend using. With this deal, you can get 39 months of PIA for a little bit over $2 per month — an 83 percent discount on its monthly price. Despite being so cheap, PIA almost never comes off as a budget VPN, coming with its own DNS servers, a built-in ad blocker and automation powers to rival CyberGhost. However, internet speeds can fluctuate while you're connected.\nWhat makes a good VPN deal\nLike I said in the intro, practically every VPN heavily discounts its long-term subscriptions the whole year round. The only noteworthy exception is Mullvad, the Costco hot dog of VPNs (that's a compliment, to be clear). When there's constantly a huge discount going on, it can be hard to tell when you're actually getting a good deal. The best way to squeeze out more savings is to look for seasonal deals, student discounts or exclusive sales like Proton VPN's coupon for Engadget readers.\nOne trick VPNs often use is to add extra months onto an introductory deal, pushing the average monthly price even lower. When it comes time to renew, you usually can't get these extra months again. You often can't even renew for the same basic period of time — for example, you may only be able to renew a two-year subscription for one year. If you're planning to hold onto a VPN indefinitely, check the fine print to see how much it will cost per month after the first renewal, and ensure that fits into your budget.\nFollow @EngadgetDeals on X for the latest tech deals and buying advice.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/best-vpn-deals-120056041.html?src=rss",
    "full_text": "You can also trawl the world for discounts that only show up in a few select regions. For those who need a VPN to stay anonymous, Proton VPN is the only service implementing full-disk encryption, which means it can manage all your traffic without any of it being visible to Proton itself. ExpressVPN — $85.42 for a two-year subscription with four months free (61 percent off): This is one of the best VPNs, especially for new users, who will find its apps and website headache-free on all platforms. Surfshark has a more closely connected server network than most VPNs, so it can rotate your IP constantly to help you evade detection — it even lets you choose your own entry and exit nodes for a double-hop connection.

    "summary": "Windows offers several built-in ways to take screenshots. Sure, you can just hit the Prt Scrn button on your keyboard to capture your entire screen, but if you want to screenshot a portion of your screen, a particular window, or you have multiple monitors there are other ways you can use Windows to achieve this. Whether you're using Windows 11 or a recent update to Windows 10, the tools remain largely consistent and reliable. \nThis guide walks you through the most useful native screenshot methods, including the Snipping Tool, keyboard shortcuts and clipboard techniques, as well as popular third-party apps for more advanced needs. For more cross-platform tips, you can also check out Engadget's guide on how to take a screenshot on any device.\nHow to use the Snipping Tool for easy screenshots\nThe Snipping Tool is the most versatile built-in screenshot option in Windows. It lets you capture specific regions, open windows or the entire screen and includes basic annotation tools. It’s available by default on Windows 11 devices, though Windows 10 users can still access the Snipping Tool, despite it being replaced by Snip & Sketch.\n\nPress Windows + Shift + S to open the Snipping Tool overlay. The screen will dim slightly and a small toolbar will appear at the top.\nChoose one of the four capture modes:\n\n\nRectangular Snip: Click and drag to select a custom rectangle.\nFreeform Snip: Draw any shape around the area you want to capture.\nWindow Snip: Click on any open window to capture it.\nFull-screen Snip: Instantly captures the entire screen.\n\n\nOnce captured, the screenshot is copied to your clipboard and a preview appears in the bottom-right corner.\nClick the preview to open the image in the Snipping Tool app, where you can annotate, save or share it.\n\nTo open the full app manually, search for the Snipping Tool from the Start menu.\nHow to use Print Screen shortcuts for quick captures\nIf you want to take a screenshot without opening an app, the Print Screen (PrtScn) key and its combinations offer the fastest method.\nWindows + Print Screen\n\nPress Windows + PrtScn to capture the entire screen and automatically save the screenshot.\nThe image is stored as a PNG file in Pictures > Screenshots.\n\nPrint Screen (alone)\n\nPress PrtScn to copy the entire screen to the clipboard. Note: depending on your PC or laptop you may need to use a keyboard combination such as Windows Key + Prt Scn.

    "full_text": "iOS 26's Adaptive Power feature could help mitigate battery compromises with a skinnier iPhone. This slim iPhone 17 could cost $900, but the price may be affected by tariffs. It could come in four color options, including a buzzed-about sky blue hue. Compare that with the iPhone 16 Pro, which weighs 199 grams (7.03 ounces). Apple is also reportedly bringing more design in-house to improve connectivity across all devices. According to Apple, this feature can help conserve battery by automatically adjusting your iPhone's performance based on how you're using it at that moment. We likely won't find out the phone's official name until Apple announces its new iPhone lineup. Keep in mind that an iPhone Flip or Fold has been rumored for years. But a Bloomberg report from March suggested the phone could cost about $900. We'll only be able to confirm these rumors with certainty when Apple officially releases the next iPhone."

With brighter screens, a faster Tensor G5 chip and a bigger battery, a lot of the improvements are software based. Magic Cue uses on-device AI to surface relevant information from apps, reducing app-hopping.\nEngadget\nThe camera app also introduces Camera Coach for shooting directions and to highlight various camera modes. While camera hardware is largely unchanged, the Pixel 10 Pro has a new Pro Res Zoom feature, using generative AI for up to 100x zoom, delivering sharper and “just better looking” results than the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra’s zoom, according to Sam Rutherford, who put the phone through its paces. This year’s Pixels also support magnetic Qi2 wireless charging, with what Google calls Pixelsnap. (It’s MagSafe for Pixels.)\nFor those seeking a more affordable option, the Pixel 10, reviewed by me, now includes a 5x telephoto lens, surpassing other base flagships, like the S25 (3x) and iPhone 16 (2x), and incorporates all the Gemini features found in the Pro device.

Rumored to be approximately 5.55 mm thick, making it the thinnest iPhone yet, it might mean a single camera and a smaller battery, but details are TBC for now.

    "summary": "Europe’s biggest gameshow is a beast. Spanning the halls of Cologne Messe, and with E3 now out of the picture, Gamescom is a bigger deal than ever. The show also attracts thousands of public attendees, which gives the show a fairground twist in places. This year, Netflix dominated one of the halls with a faux One Piece ship, sports stadium, a Wednesday-themed cafe and a Stranger Things ice cream stall.\nElsewhere, while Nintendo didn’t have anything new to show, it had plenty of Switch 2 consoles to convince the not-yet-convinced — and some of them had Silksong. Microsoft, too, had a substantial presence, revealing an October 16 launch date for its Xbox Ally duo of handheld gaming PCs. No price, though.\nWhile you can find all the news and previews on our Gamescom page, we’ve also drawn together all the other games we tested during this week’s show, several of which launch in the next few weeks.\n\nMetal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater\nKonami\nWhile the man who created Metal Gear moved onto walking sims and Hollywood best friends, Konami is more than happy to beef up and remaster the hits. This time around, it’s Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater.\nI’ll admit, Snake Eater was when I fell off the Metal Gear Solid train (or nuclear mech), and it came undone by the camouflage system and the difficult-to-navigate early areas. A very tight demo, as the Gamescom crowds rushed to early demos meant I didn’t get a chance to fully test the new style control system that (thankfully) shifts crouch and action/ confirm to separate buttons and adds a degree of camera control even in third-person. But it’s these kind of quality-of-life upgrades you can expect to see.\nOf course, the graphics are a huge leap from the PS2 original (or Nintendo 3DS version I bafflingly chose to buy), but the pulpy (occasionally delightfully camp) dialogue remains in place. I look forward to getting through at least the opening scenes now that the game has launched on PlayStation 5, Windows, and Xbox Series X/S.\n\nThere Are No Ghosts at the Grand\nMicrosoft\nWhat a weird game. Not in a bad way. Things start off in the titular dilapidated Grand Hotel, with me renovating a room with PowerWash Simulator-inspired water guns, spray guns, sand blasters and vacuum. You can scan the area to get hints on what needs doing, while a naggy Scottish smartphone app will also try to help — but not really. There’s also a talking cat, apparently, called Mr. Bones the Bastard, but he wasn’t talking in this demo.\nThe early trailer teased a mystery that needs to be solved in the village, and while I didn’t get a glimpse of that, I was soon tasked with checking out some mysterious black gunk.\nThe developers even put a little more effort into the demo, with voiced lines that will likely never be heard in the retail version, teasing that the protagonist was being “onboarded” when he’s interrupted by one of the characters that populate the village around the hotel.\nSeconds later, I’m riding a scooter to the dock, with a cat enjoying the ride, fixing a boat, getting a sassy soliloquy from the woman who convinced me to drive my boat into the sea. There are plenty more songs to come as new characters join the mystery.\nAs a reminder, the demo started with me sandblasting tatty wallpaper off period walls. I’m intrigued.\n\nResident Evil Requiem\n\nWe’ve got a more detailed breakdown by contributor Alessandro Fillari here, but I got a chance to get scared out of my skin too. The headline feature is the ability to play between first- and third-person perspectives. Still, it revealed an uncomfortable truth to myself: I'm a total coward and playing in third person is much less scary.\n\nOnimusha: Way of the Sword\nCapcom\nCapcom’s return to its samurai vs. demons series is satisfying and fun, especially when compared to more punishing games in the genre, like Sekiro. However, the early chapters have a pretty basic attack flow, and I'm keen to see how things evolve beyond that. At least they’ve got one thing right: a great villain to loathe.\n\nHollow Knight: Silksong\n\nThe long-running DLC-into-sequel-into-meme-sensation is almost here, right? The demo at Gamescom remained the most popular attraction at Microsoft’s booth. Two Xbox Ally handhelds were also running the demo, which I was fortunate enough to test on. And I can say… yep, still plays like a faster, slicker Hollow Knight.\nHaving played it a heady six years ago, it’s now actually difficult to discern the differences between the early build and what is surely an almost-final snapshot of the game. One of the notable changes is its more elaborate lighting effects and details —  things Redditors have pored over as each new trailer video appeared. I stand by my hands-on impressions from 2019, even if they have a fine vintage at this point.\nBut when is it coming out? Oh, September 4. \n\nAll the announcements from Gamescom 2025\n\nCall of Duty: Black Ops 7 arrives on November 14\nXbox Ally handhelds will be available October 16, but we still don't know the price\nXbox unveils its Handheld Compatibility Program\nDouble Fine’s Keeper may have the most endearing video game double act since Banjo and Kazooie\nSony Inzone launches new peripherals in collaboration with Fnatic\nDenshattack! is a blend of Tony Hawk, trains and shonen anime\nBattlestar Galactica might finally get the video game adaption it deserves\nBlack Myth: Zhong Kui is the next title from Game Science Studio\nFromSoft's Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice is becoming an anime\nFallout season two has a teaser trailer and a December 17 release date\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/everything-we-played-at-gamescom-2025-110017871.html?src=rss",

    "full_text": "There is a mouse graveyard in my office cabinet — devices I’ve tried and discarded because they didn’t help with my shoulder aches. The solution was a roller ball mouse and Logitech’s MX Ergo is the best I’ve found. It tilts for a more natural “handshake” grip and has a slow-mo option for more precise movements in Photoshop and other apps. You can even program the various buttons to do app-specific things using Logitech’s software. It's also a handy companion for an iPad and makes a good Mac accessory as well. My only gripe is the antiquated micro-USB charging port, but the battery lasts long enough that I only have to use it once every few months. It’s pricey at $100, so you may prefer the $70 Ergo Lift. It also offers a handshake grip, but without the roller ball, and has Bluetooth or USB dongle connectivity options. Of course, there's also Apple's own Magic Trackpad, which basically replicates the MacBook's touch surface so you can place it anywhere. If you're a fan of the multi-touch gestures on your MacBook, this could be a more comfortable way to use them."

    "full_text": "There are often better and cheaper alternatives to Apple’s first-party accessories, but the company’s MagSafe wireless charger is worth considering if you have a new iPhone. Like all other MagSafe accessories, this charging pad uses magnets to attach to the back of the latest iPhones and it’s surprisingly strong. Not only can you safely pick up your handset and use it with the disk still attached, but the iPhone can dangle by the charger’s cord without falling off. (You still probably shouldn’t do this.) The charging plate itself is about a quarter-inch thick so it barely adds any heft to the iPhone. The magnets only attach to the latest iPhones, but it will still charge older models wirelessly, going back to the iPhone 8. I only wish the cable were longer than three feet so that you had more leeway to use your iPhone on the couch or in bed while powering it up. Apple’s MagSafe charger accessory comes in at $39 (and the latest model will cost you $50), but if you want to spend a bit less, Spigen’s $25 ArcField magnetic wireless charger is a decent dupe. It’s magnets are nowhere near as strong as those on the Apple MagSafe charger — so you definitely shouldn’t pick up your iPhone by this cable — but it’ll power up your handset and stay put while doing so."

    "summary": "\nIn just a few days, the Apple iPhone 17 event will be here — the \"awe dropping\" event is officially confirmed for Tuesday, September 9. If Apple follows its past schedule, that could mean we'll get to download iOS 26 and iPad 26 exactly one week after the event. Coming with the OS 26es are huge upgrades to your iPhone and iPad's operating systems. You've heard of Liquid Glass, right? It's like the better-executed version of Windows Vista and definitely one of the cooler features coming this fall. We spent two weeks test-driving it — you can check out our detailed hands-on iOS 26 preview, or you can try it out yourself by downloading and installing the public beta 5. That software is a more stable iteration of the separate developer version, which recently hit the beta 8 waypoint, and offers a few more flashy features not yet available in the public version. (While the public beta is open to everyone and quite stable, always remember there's a degree of risk involved with beta software.) Additionally, there are credible reports that iOS 26 could bring a new live translation feature to AirPods, too. Not sure if you want to upgrade your smartphone or tablet this year? No worries, we'll help you find out if your devices will be able to run iOS 26.\nWhile Apple didn't nix any iPhones from its eligibility list last year, that's not the case for 2025 — a few models are getting cut this time. All iPhone 8 models and the iPhone X were the last to get the boot in 2023, and this year the 2018 models are getting left behind. If you have an ineligible device, you won't be able to download iOS 26 when it becomes available this fall. \nWe'll get to the bottom of which iPhones and iPads will support iOS 26 and iPadOS 26 this year. To see what's coming with the latest OSes, check out everything announced at Apple's WWDC June 9 event. One thing you shouldn't immediately expect is Apple's updated version of Siri, though the company is reportedly working on a 'stripped-down' AI chatbot to compete with ChatGPT. \nThese three iPhones won't be compatible with iOS 26\nUnlike last year, several iPhone models won't be eligible to download the newest iOS when it makes its debut in September. This trio of models first released in 2018 won't be coming to the iOS 26 party:\n\niPhone XR\niPhone XS\niPhone XS Max\n\niPhones compatible with iOS 26\nWhile we don't yet know the new iPhones Apple will be dropping next month — though there are iPhone 17 rumors — we do know, per Apple's site, that the phones listed below will be compatible with iOS 26. Basically, if you have an iPhone that was announced in 2019 or later, you're in the clear:\n\niPhone SE (second generation or later)\niPhone 11\niPhone 11 Pro\niPhone 11 Pro Max\niPhone 12\niPhone 12 mini\niPhone 12 Pro\niPhone 12 Pro Max\niPhone 13\niPhone 13 mini\niPhone 13 Pro\niPhone 13 Pro Max\niPhone 14\niPhone 14 Plus\niPhone 14 Pro\niPhone 14 Pro Max\niPhone 15\niPhone 15 Plus\niPhone 15 Pro\niPhone 15 Pro Max\niPhone 16\niPhone 16 Plus\niPhone 16 Pro\niPhone 16 Pro Max\niPhone 16e\n\niPads compatible with iPadOS 26\nThe iPads listed below, and any iPads released later this year, are eligible to download iPadOS 26.\n\niPad Pro (M4)\niPad Pro 12.9‑inch (3rd generation and later)\niPad Pro 11‑inch (1st generation and later)\niPad Air (3rd generation and later, including M2 and M3)\niPad (8th generation and later, including A16)\niPad mini (5th generation and later, including A17 Pro)\n\nWhat if I don't want to buy a new iPhone?\nIf you want to continue using your older iPhone that isn't supported by iOS 26, that's fine. However, you'll miss out on security updates which could potentially put your phone at risk for malware and other threats. Additionally, some apps may stop working if they require a certain version of iOS or later. And of course, you won't be able to access the latest features iOS 26 offers.\nWhen will iOS 26 become available?\nApple usually rolls out its latest iOS in mid-September, just a few days before the new iPhones hit store shelves. Last year, it released iOS 18 on Monday, Sept. 16. If it follows suit this year, we should have access to the new operating system on Tuesday, Sept. 16 — exactly one week after the event.\nExpect a confirmation of the release date at the iPhone 17 event on September 9. \niOS 26 features we're excited about\nLiquid Glass design: Your home screen is getting revamped with new app icons, including dark mode and all-clear options. You'll also notice buttons with a new floating design. Liquid Glass was designed to make all of Apple's OSes more cohesive.\nPhone app redesign: You'll finally be able to scroll through contacts, recent calls and voicemail messages all on one screen. It also comes with a new feature called Hold Assist that'll notify you when an agent comes to the phone so you can avoid the elevator music.\nLive Translate: iOS 26 is bringing the ability to have a conversation via phone call or text message with someone who speaks another language. Live Translate will translate your conversation in real time. \nPolls feature: Coming to group messages in the Messages app, chat members will be able to create polls. This can help prevent the unwanted 30+ messages when it comes to deciding which restaurant you're meeting at this weekend.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/apples-new-ios-26-public-beta-5-is-here-but-is-your-iphone-eligible-for-the-update-check-this-list-191854133.html?src=rss",

Most ChatGPT users keep clicking on “delete” toggles that aren’t technically deleting anything. Privacy experts have long warned that the complexity surrounding AI makes meaningful user consent nearly unattainable.

The new feature replaces a similar one Rakuten used to offer for Pocket users, which it was forced to replace after Mozilla decided to shut down the read-it-later service in May 2025.\nInstapaper on Kobo devices works nearly identically to the way Pocket did previously. With your Instapaper account linked, you can access any article you've saved to your library. Articles can be downloaded and accessed offline, and you can like, delete or archive them as you see fit. As someone who relied on the Pocket integration to work my way through a ridiculous backlog of saved articles, Instapaper makes a capable replacement. Really, the only thing the feature is missing at this point is support for handwritten annotations on Kobos with styluses, like the Kobo Libra Colour or Kobo Elipsa 2E.\nMozilla made the decision to wind down Pocket and a few other smaller products to conserve time and resources that might be better spent on Firefox.

    "full_text": "Rakuten and Instapaper have announced a new integration that lets you access saved articles on Kobo ereaders. The new feature replaces a similar one Rakuten used to offer for Pocket users, which it was forced to replace after Mozilla decided to shut down the read-it-later service in May 2025. Instapaper on Kobo devices works nearly identically to the way Pocket did previously. Articles can be downloaded and accessed offline, and you can like, delete or archive them as you see fit. As someone who relied on the Pocket integration to work my way through a ridiculous backlog of saved articles, Instapaper makes a capable replacement. Really, the only thing the feature is missing at this point is support for handwritten annotations on Kobos with styluses, like the Kobo Libra Colour or Kobo Elipsa 2E. Mozilla made the decision to wind down Pocket and a few other smaller products to conserve time and resources that might be better spent on Firefox.

    "summary": "You might already have a good idea of which smartphone you want to be your next one. But there are more solid options available now than ever before, making the decision not as cut-and-dry as it used to be. While the decision is a bit easier if you know you want an iPhone, there's even enough variation between those new models that you may have to think about it longer than you anticipated. If you’re an Android person, you have even more options to choose from — including foldables — and more questions to answer before you spend any money.At Engadget, we review phones regularly and have tested dozens over the years. Whether you’ve had your eye on one of our current top picks, one of Samsung's Galaxy S25 phones, a cheap phone or another device, we’re here to help you decide which is the best phone to buy this year.\nAndroid or iOS?\nWhen you're searching for the best smartphone, it becomes clear that each OS has its pros and cons. Apple’s tight-knit ecosystem makes it super easy to share data between iPhones, iPads and Macs or seamlessly hand-off phone calls or music from one device to another. At the same time, you’re effectively locked in, as services like Apple Messages aren’t available on other platforms. \nAs for Android, there’s a much wider range of handsets from companies like Google, Samsung, Sony and more. However, Android phones don’t enjoy that same length of software support and often have lower trade-in values. In short, there’s no wrong answer. However, you will want to consider how your phone will fit in with the rest of your devices. So unless you’re really fed up with one OS and willing to learn another, it probably doesn’t make a lot of sense to switch from an iPhone to an Android phone (or vice versa) – especially if everyone else in your household is using the same platform.\nCameras\nSince your cell phone often pulls double duty as your primary camera, figuring out what kind of photo tools you want is key. Nowadays, practically every mobile phone can take a great picture in bright light. But if you want a long optical zoom, you’ll probably have to upgrade to a more expensive device.\n\n\n\n\n   Cherlynn Low / Engadget \n \n\nMid-range phones often only have two rear cameras (a primary wide-angle lens and a secondary ultra-wide camera) and can sometimes struggle in low-light situations. Each phone maker also has various features that might be a better fit for your style, with Apple offering four different color presets on the latest iPhones, while Google’s Pixel 9 Pro comes with neat tools like dedicated long exposure and Action Pan modes.\nWill you get mmWave 5G or Wi-Fi 7?\nThe good news is that in 2025, most phones have at least Wi-Fi 6 or Wi-Fi 6e and support for some kind of 5G connectivity. However, if you want the fastest wireless speeds possible, it’s going to cost you a little extra. For example, on certain networks, mmWave 5G offers up to gigabit download speeds, less latency and better bandwidth. But mmWave 5G also requires more sophisticated (and pricier) modems, which means support for it is often missing on less expensive devices.\nOn the bright side, mmWave 5G isn’t as widely available as other versions of 5G, so depending on where you live and what network you’re on, you may not be missing out on much right now if you buy a phone that doesn’t support it. It’s a similar situation for Wi-Fi 7, which is available on some high-end handsets like the Galaxy S25, but harder to find on cheaper devices. Wi-Fi 7 also requires you to have a compatible router, so unless you know you need it or have a specific use case in mind, the lack of support for mmWave 5G or Wi-Fi 7 shouldn’t be a dealbreaker when looking for a new phone.\nOther features to consider\nBecause not everyone agrees on what makes the best phone, you should think about any other specs that might be extra important for you. Mobile gamers will almost certainly appreciate the 120Hz refresh rates you get on phones like the Samsung Galaxy S25 or the Apple iPhone 16 Pro. Alternatively, if long battery life is important, you’ll probably want to go with a larger iPhone or an Android phone with a battery that’s between 4,000 and 5,000 mAh in size. Meanwhile, if you find yourself juggling a lot of devices, it can be really nice to have a phone that supports reverse wireless charging, which on Samsung phones even lets you recharge the company’s Galaxy Watches.\n \n \n \n \n \n \nOther smartphones we've tested\nOnePlus 13\nWhile the OnePlus 13 features some basic AI features like Google’s Circle to Search and Gemini assistant, it’s really just an old-fashioned flagship in all the best ways. That’s because instead of focusing on machine learning, OnePlus crammed the phone with tons of top-notch hardware. It sports a 6.8-inch OLED display with an incredible peak brightness of up to 4,500 nits. The OP13 also offers excellent performance thanks to Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 8 Elite chip, along with 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage. There are also three 50-MP rear cameras including one with a 3x telephoto zoom and a massive 6,000 mAh battery that’s bigger than what you get in practically all of its competitors.\nOnePlus didn’t skimp on the phone’s design either, as the OP13 still comes with the company’s signature Alert Slider. Plus, if you opt for the blue or white variants, you’ll get a durable and very touchable vegan leather back that helps the phone stand out among all its glass brick rivals. But the best part is that starting at $900, it costs less than an equivalent Galaxy S25+ too.\nFAQs\nHow do I know which smartphone is the best for me?\nWhile choosing the best smartphone can be challenging, it mostly comes down to how you plan on using the device. All of the best phones available now get the basics right — you’ll be able to make calls, text and access the internet without many hiccups. If your smartphone is your most used gadget, you may want to consider paying for a device on the higher end of the price spectrum. That will get you better overall performance, higher-quality cameras and a phone that will last for many years. If you don’t use your phone for everything, you may be able to compromise on performance and extra perks and spend less on a still-capable handset.\nHow much is a smartphone?\nSmartphones range in price from $300 to over $1,500. The best budget phones available now will usually compromise on overall performance, design, camera prowess and extra features to keep costs down. On the flip side, the most expensive phones will have powerful processors, triple-camera arrays and even flip or fold designs. Most people will find a phone that fits their needs somewhere in the middle of that wide price range — we’ve found that most of the best smartphones available right now cost between $500 and $1,000.\nWhat can you do on a smartphone?\nSmartphones are essentially small, portable computers that let you do things like check email, browse social media, follow map directions, make contactless payments and more. This is all on top of the basics like making phone calls and texting, which we’ve come to expect in all modern cell phones. Smartphones have also mostly replaced compact cameras thanks to their high-quality, built-in shooters, and the fact that most smartphones today as just as portable, if not more so, as compact cameras.\nHow long do smartphones last?\nSmartphones can last years and people are holding on to their phones longer now than ever before. Software updates and battery life are two of the biggest factors that can affect phone longevity. Apple promises five years worth of software updates for its latest iPhones, and Google promises the same for its Pixel phones. Samsung phones will get four years worth of Android updates from the time they launch. As for charging speeds and battery life, your phone can deteriorate over time as you use and recharge your phone on a regular basis.\nRecent updates\nAugust 2025: Updated to include the Google Pixel 10 Pro.\nJuly 2025: Updated to include the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7.\nApril 2025: Updated to include the Google Pixel 9a.\nFebruary 2025: Updated to include the iPhone 16e.\nJanuary 2025: Updated to include details about Samsung's latest Galaxy S-series phones.\nSeptember 2024: Updated to include the latest iPhone 16 models and a new midrange iPhone top pick.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/best-smartphones-140004900.html?src=rss",

But mmWave 5G also requires more sophisticated (and pricier) modems, which means support for it is often missing on less expensive devices. As we discovered in our testing for the iPhone 16 Pro review, it’ll take a bit of getting used to at first. Not only do both devices now support full high-res portrait shots, its 100x Pro Res Zoom captures long-range photos in ways that lenses and megapixels alone simply can’t. Then you add in noticeably better performance, bigger batteries, brighter displays and proper Qi2 magnetic charging (the first from a major Android phone maker) via Pixelsnap and you have truly smart devices that makes picking anything else seem kind of dumb. So while it's not super fancy, the phone has all of its most important bases covered (and then some). Sadly there’s still no dedicated telephoto lens, which makes it less useful in some shooting situations. But the best part is that starting at $900, it costs less than an equivalent Galaxy S25+ too."

    "summary": "The RX1R III is an incredible camera, capable of capturing stunning photos. However, for something Sony waited nearly a decade to update and is charging $5,100 for, it also feels like a missed opportunity. First, the RX1R III is nearly $2,000 more expensive than its predecessor. Plus, it’s missing a handful of features the company really should have included for it to hold its own against other high-end compact cameras, including Fujifilm’s X100VI and GFX100RF, as well as the Leica Q3 family. I love the RX1R III, but I wish it was easier to recommend.\n \nImage quality and autofocus\n\n\n\n\n   Igor Bonifacic for Engadget \n \n\nNew to the RX1R III is a 61-megapixel full-frame sensor Sony first introduced alongside the A7R IV back in 2019. It might be an old component, but having so much resolution in a camera I could carry everywhere felt like cheating. \nWhat hasn't changed is the glass on the RX1R III. The camera still has the same fixed 35mm f/2.0 Zeiss lens that debuted on the original RX1R in 2012. With past models, autofocus was often an issue, but it turns out the Zeiss lens wasn't to blame. It was the focusing algorithms on the older cameras.\nLike the A7R V, the RX1R III comes with Sony's flagship Bionz XR image processor and a dedicated chip for AI-assisted subject detection. At first, I was skeptical of the RX1R III's autofocus capabilities since the camera doesn't come with a joystick to make it easy to set a focus point manually. As it turns out, it doesn't need one. The autofocus on the RX1R III feels magical, thanks to its subject tracking. The seven different recognition modes offered by the RX1R III cover most of the things I like to shoot — including people, pets and birds — and getting the camera to lock onto a subject was simple. All I had to do was press and hold the new \"AF-ON\" button. The camera can be configured to prioritize specific subjects, but I found that wasn't necessary to do; I could delegate focusing entirely to the camera.\nAll of that brings me back to the RX1R III's Zeiss glass. I know some people will be disappointed Sony didn't add a new lens, but I'm a fan of the decision. For me, the character of that lens has always been part of the appeal of the series, and it's my favorite aspect of the new model.\nWith Sony's 61MP sensor behind it, the Zeiss optics can capture photos with a great amount of detail without ever feeling clinical or overly sharp like with many of the company's G Master lenses. The best way I can describe the rendering is that it's Leica-like with beautiful, creamy bokeh. With the right light, the RX1R III can produce images that look almost painterly, and reviewing the photos I snapped with it, they're among some of the best I've captured in the 10 years I've been shooting.\nAt the same time, I think Sony deserves credit for greatly improving the color science of its JPEGs. The company has long offered excellent RAW support, but the older I get, the more I appreciate a camera that can produce great images with minimal editing. With the RX1R III, Sony has delivered that. The camera offers a total of 12 JPEG profiles with six custom slots. Two of the default profiles, Film 2 and Film 3, are borrowed from the FX3, and offer calming, muted tones that are a nice contrast to the more vivid colors Sony is typically known for.\nAs for video, there's not much to say. The RX1R III can capture 4K footage at 60 frames per second and 1080p clips at 120 fps. That said, as I'll get to in a moment, Sony's new model is missing some features that would have made it a competent video camera. As things stand, I think it's only suited for capturing home videos you don't plan to share with the world.\nDesign and handling\n\n\n\n\n   Igor Bonifacic for Engadget \n \n\nThe first time I looked through the RX1R III's viewfinder, I thought Sony had sent me a defective unit. The redesigned EVF is now built into the top left of the camera, but the company seems to have pulled the screen from the parts bin, as it only offers 2.36 million dots of resolution. For context, the A7R V has a 9.44-million-dot OLED EVF, while the older A7R IV has a 5.76-million-dot screen. It's jarring going from the new rear-panel LCD and viewfinder. It also feels cheap. A $5,100 camera should include a top-of-the-line EVF.\nThe viewfinder is not the only part of the RX1R III that left me confused about what Sony was thinking. There's the rear screen I just mentioned, which is both better and worse than the one before. On the one hand, it offers nearly double the resolution, thanks to its 2.36-million-dot panel. On the other hand, it's no longer articulating, which feels like a major step back since it makes shooting candid shots from the hip a lot harder. And forget about vlogging or taking selfies.\nSeparately, Sony hasn't weather-sealed the III. Again, that's a feature I'd like to see on such an expensive camera. Thankfully, battery life is improved, with the RX1R III supporting Sony's larger NP-FW50 batteries. I could comfortably get a day of shooting out of the latest model if I was good about powering off the camera when I wasn't using it.\nI could overlook all the complaints I mentioned if Sony had just added in-body image stabilization (IBIS). When I reviewed the Fujifilm X100VI last year, that feature alone felt transformational. More than just improving image quality, it made the X100VI into a camera that could shoot in nearly any light. I understand Sony likely wanted to keep the III small and light, but again, $5,100 is a lot to pay to not have a feature that many high-end cameras offer.\nWrap-up\nI've mentioned a few of the RX1R III’s competitors in passing, but now I think it makes sense to consider where Sony's new camera fits in the market. Most people shopping for a premium compact camera will probably start their search with the X100VI. If you can find one in stock, it's significantly cheaper than the RX1R III, coming in at $1,800. Sure, you're forgoing a full-frame sensor for a smaller APS-C sensor. But for most people, I think that's a fair tradeoff, especially when the X100VI also offers IBIS, an articulating screen, an optical viewfinder and Fujifilm's excellent color simulations.\nIf you want the largest possible sensor, I'd argue Fujifilm's GFX100RF, which has a medium-format 100MP sensor, makes more sense — even with all of its faults and a price increase coming at the end of the month. There are also the Leica Q3 and Q3 43 to consider. At $6,735 and $7,380 respectively, both are more expensive than the RX1R III, but come with nicer displays, IBIS and Leica glass.\nLike I said at the start, I wish the RX1R III was easier to recommend, but it occupies a strange space where it's not necessarily better or different enough from its rivals. Inflation and Trump's tariffs likely tied Sony's hands to a degree, but the company could have still made the new model more compelling by avoiding some of its questionable design decisions.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cameras/sony-rx1r-iii-review-waiting-10-years-to-be-underwhelmed-160036397.html?src=rss",

As things stand, I think it's only suited for capturing home videos you don't plan to share with the world. Again, that's a feature I'd like to see on such an expensive camera. When I reviewed the Fujifilm X100VI last year, that feature alone felt transformational. More than just improving image quality, it made the X100VI into a camera that could shoot in nearly any light. Most people shopping for a premium compact camera will probably start their search with the X100VI. Like I said at the start, I wish the RX1R III was easier to recommend, but it occupies a strange space where it's not necessarily better or different enough from its rivals. Inflation and Trump's tariffs likely tied Sony's hands to a degree, but the company could have still made the new model more compelling by avoiding some of its questionable design decisions."

    "summary": "Bose announced its latest earbuds in June, but the QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds (2nd gen) ($299) won’t arrive until early September. Today, though, they’re available for preorder, and I’ve spent the last few weeks testing all the new features. This model is an overhaul of the noise-canceling earbuds the company debuted in 2023 alongside its take on spatial audio. Among the upgrades, Bose has improved the active noise cancellation (ANC) performance, enhanced call quality and added wireless charging to the case. Two years later, the QuietComfort Ultra is still the best option for those primarily concerned with blocking distractions, and Bose’s tweaks make its best earbuds even better.\n \nWhat’s new on the QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds (2nd gen)?\nThe new QC Ultra Earbuds are at their best in Quiet mode. This is Bose’s option for full noise cancellation without spatial audio (or Immersive Audio, as the company calls it). Here, there’s no doubt these are still the best noise-cancelling earbuds available right now. The first-gen version achieved the same feat, but Bose has gone a step further to enhance its ANC setup for this refresh. \nSpecifically, the company updated the algorithm for its ActiveSense technology in Aware (transpancy) Mode. Now the QC Ultra Earbuds offer smoother changes in ANC levels to combat sudden spikes in ambient noise. This means things like sirens should no longer drown out your music or podcast. Unfortunately, I wasn’t able to trigger the retooled adaptive ANC with simulated police sirens from YouTube — the best option on my quiet cul-de-sac — but I’ll report back if I notice any oddities here.\nBose also upgraded call quality on the QC Ultra Earbuds. The company says a new AI-powered setup, known as SpeechClarity, works with “the earbuds’ eight microphones, dynamic mixing and adaptive filters” to focus on your voice. Bose explains that it uses audio augmentation tech that was originally developed for hearing aids here, which can reduce background noise like wind or the drone of an office. During my tests, the revised system silenced a noisy fan, rendering it completely absent from my recordings. However, overall voice quality suffers as you will sound a bit staticky when all the audio processing kicks in.\nThankfully, you no longer need an additional accessory for wireless charging on the QC Ultra Earbuds. With the first-gen model, you had to buy a separate cover to enable cable-free recharging. Bose has now built all of that into the case for the second-gen set, a welcome upgrade that really should’ve been here from the start. When the original QC Ultra Earbuds debuted in 2023, wireless charging was certainly already the norm.\nWhat’s still great about the QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds (2nd gen)?\n\n\n\n\n   Billy Steele for Engadget \n \n\nAs I mentioned, the overall ANC performance of the QC Ultra Earbuds remains unmatched. If you’re looking to block out distractions, this is the best option that still offers great sound quality. Bose even manages to cancel out human voices better than most of its rivals, which can be a struggle for much of the competition.\nAudio quality on these earbuds remains near the top of the heap. You won’t notice as much detail as Noble Audio’s FoKus Rex5 or Technics’ AZ100, but there’s great clarity here nonetheless. Bose says the tuning was “slightly refined” for improved bass response and smoother high frequencies. I noticed that tracks with deep bass, like Deftones’ “locked club,” are clearer at the low end. Meanwhile, treble-forward instruments in songs like Miles Davis’ “Green Haze” sound crisper and cleaner than before.\nDespite their larger size, this year’s buds offer a surprisingly balanced and comfortable fit. Bose refreshed the ear tips for the QC Ultra Earbuds with a new guard to prevent wax build up. Touch controls are still reliable, and you can disable them entirely on this second-gen version.\nWhat’s not so good about the QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds (2nd gen)?\nThe biggest gripe I have with the overhaul of the QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds is the lack of improvement to battery life. I was disappointed to see that a better runtime wasn’t part of the upgrades when I read the announcement in June, and I’m still not over it. On this model, you’ll get up to six hours of use with ANC turned on. Like before, if you listen with that spatial Immersive Audio enabled, that drops to four hours. A couple more hours would’ve been nice, enough to keep the QC Ultra Earbuds in place for a full work day without having to give them a lunch break in the case.\nWhile the design doesn’t bother me too much, I know the look of the QC Ultra Earbuds isn’t for everyone. There is a bit of a mini Bluetooth headset vibe going on here, and the overall size of the buds are on the larger side when much of the competition is racing to be the smallest. Like I said, none of this impacts comfort or stability, and I’d bet many prospective buyers are willing to live with the aesthetic in exchange for the type of silence the QC Ultra Earbuds deliver.\nWrap-up\nThe upgrades on the second-gen QC Ultra Earbuds don’t make for a wildly new product, but they do provide enough for a notable improvement over the previous version. ANC and call performance are both enhanced, and though it’s late to the party, the addition of built-in wireless charging is a welcome change. Other updates, like the tuning tweaks and the ability to turn off touch controls, are quality-of-life changes that undoubtedly improve the overall experience. Bose has done all of this without changing the price from the 2023 model, which is a surprising choice in the current economic climate. Simply put, the QC Ultra Earbuds remain the best option for wireless noise-cancelling earbuds, and that’s not likely to change anytime soon.\nThe Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds (2nd gen) are available for preorder in the US today, August 28. The general on-sale date is scheduled for September 10.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/bose-quietcomfort-ultra-earbuds-2nd-gen-review-still-a-noise-canceling-powerhouse-153017601.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "As soon as I picked up Honor’s Magic V5, I was a little concerned about its durability. The fourth generation of Honor’s Android foldable may not be massively thinner than its predecessor, but it sure feels like it. Yes, it’s built with aerospace-grade materials to make it sturdy despite its svelteness, but it’s also the first foldable I’d insist on buying a case for because goodness me, it’s thin.\nIf you recall, the last handset in this series was the Magic V3 and no, you haven’t fallen asleep and missed a year. The number four can represent bad luck in Chinese culture as its Cantonese form (sei) sounds almost identical to the word for death (séi). Consequently, we’ve skipped a model number.\nThe V5 is so svelte it’ll barely make an impression on your pants pocket, measuring 8.8mm folded and 4.1mm open. That’s not a big difference to the V3’s 9.2mm / 4.35mm, but it certainly feels like a rubicon has been crossed. It’s worth noting Honor is marking its own homework with one eye closed here, since it can only reach that thickness with the white V5. The other colorways (black, red and gold) stack up at 9mm / 4.2mm, which is almost the same as Samsung’s Z Fold 7.\nPhoto by Daniel Cooper for Engadget\nNaturally, a premium foldable deserves premium internals, and the V5 packs a Snapdragon 8 Elite with 16GB RAM and 512GB storage. There’s a 5,820mAh silicon carbon battery that, when paired with the company’s usual AI power-management tools, promises nearly 50 hours of life on a charge. I won’t comment on that claim but I can say this is the snappiest and fastest Honor foldable I’ve laid my eyes and hands on. There’s no lag or delay when switching displays, and everything feels like it’s already served up seconds before you’ve even asked for it.\nBut in the same way no modern smartphone is a dramatic departure from what went before, the rest of the story here is nips and tucks. The Magic V5 has the same 6.43-inch cover display as the V3, and the main screen has grown only slightly, from 7.92 inches to 7.95 inches. The only useful tweak is support for Honor’s MagicPen stylus on both screens, but it’s the same size as an Apple Pencil, so you’ll need to find a place to store it.\nPhoto by Daniel Cooper for Engadget\nIt’s a similar story of modest changes on the imaging front as the V5 is equipped with a 50-megapixel f/1.6 primary camera with OIS. That's paired with a 64-megapixel, f/2.5 periscope telephoto (also with OIS) and a 50-megapixel f/2.0 ultra-wide. Overall, that’s an improvement on the previous model, but both selfie cameras (in the cover and primary display) are the same 20-megapixel shooter found in the V3. Of course, performance is bolstered by the usual AI features that may or may not be useful.\nHonor has announced European pricing for the V5, with it costing €1,999 (around $2,317) in the EU and £1,699 (around $2,283) in the UK. That puts it in the same rough bracket as the Z Fold 7, although there's so many deals and discounts these days you can always save money if you look. I'm still not sure if Honor isn't selling itself short by not undercutting its rivals more aggressively, but it must feel it can compete, and win, against Samsung and the like on an even playing field. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/honors-magic-v5-foldable-almost-feels-too-thin-143022082.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "DJI's busy engineering team is at it again with the creation of the company's third wireless mic system in less than two years. The new flagship DJI Mic 3 has a wholesale design change from the Mic 2 plus numerous improvements in areas like sound quality, noise reduction and the number of subjects you can record at once — though there is one downgrade compared to to the last model. I've had one for over a week so I'll provide some impressions as well.\nThe most noticeable change with the Mic 3 is the smaller transmitter size and lighter weight. It weighs just 16 grams (.58 ounces) compared to 28 grams (.99 ounces) for the Mic 2, though it's bigger and heavier than the Mic Mini transmitter (10 grams). DJI has also improved the transmitter mounting options, introducing a rotating clip along with the magnetic option. There's even a choice of five colors for the windscreen to better match your subject's clothing. \nThe smaller size and rotating clip makes the Mic 3 more discreet and easier to attach to any shirt or hat. However, there's still a large \"DJI\" logo on both sides of the transmitter that looks ugly but gives the company free advertising, I suppose. \n\n\n\n\n  Steve Dent for Engadget\n \n\nThe charging case holds a receiver and two transmitters and, unlike the last model, now lets you insert the transmitter with the magnetic mount and windscreen still attached. Fully charged transmitters can run for about eight hours and the receiver can go 10 hours. However, the case provides enough power to charge all three devices 2.4 times for about 28 hours of extended use. This feature makes the Mic 3 useful for marathon shoots and was key to the success of the original DJI Mic, though competitors like Sennheiser have caught on and introduced similar cases.\nThe Mic 3 now supports up to four transmitters and eight receivers at once. That means you can record four subjects at a time to as many as eight receivers simultaneously for multi-camera shoots (if you purchase the extra kits, of course). I wasn't able to test this feature as I had just a single kit, but it'll be handy for large jobs if it works as advertised. \nTo make syncing and lining up all that audio and video simpler, the Mic 3 now offers high-precision timecode capture embedded during internal recording. I tested this feature with two cameras, and once I figured out how to align the shots in DaVinci Resolve, it proved to be a valuable post-production timesaver.\n\n\n\n\n  DJI\n \n\nThe receiver can also be set to quadrophonic mode for select Sony cameras and software, allowing independent output of four channels at once to a single camera. DJI is promising a range of 400 meters (around 1,300 feet) and strong resistance to interference via automatic frequency hopping between the 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands.\nThere are some major improvements in audio quality as well. It's DJI's first microphone with two adaptive gain control modes. For noisy outdoor environments like sporting events, Automatic mode suppresses sudden volume spikes to prevent clipping. Dynamic mode, meanwhile, adjusts gain on the fly in response to volume changes to ensure consistent loudness in quieter settings like studios. \nI tested this feature in Paris in a relatively quiet studio and outside with traffic and other city noises. The Automatic setting did a good job suppressing those unwanted sounds without a noticeable impact on audio quality. And the dynamic mode kept my speaking levels steady even when I trailed off at the end of sentences, again without impacting voice timbre or clarity. \n\n\n\n\n  DJI\n \n\nThe Mic 3 is also DJI's first with three tone presets (Regular, Rich and Bright) to handle different voice characteristics (medium, low and high pitches). This feature also worked as advertised. Set to \"Regular,\" I needed less equalization than usual to even out my voice and it worked equally well on a higher-pitched female voice. \nTwo-level active noise cancelation reduces background sounds like air conditioning and wind noise. Again, this worked effectively, though like any noise reduction algorithm, it impacted voice quality by artificially reducing some frequencies. Finally, the lossless audio feature lets the mic send uncompressed 48kHz 24-bit audio directly to the receiver to eliminate any MPEG audio artifacts. This is likely overkill for most use cases. While the Mic 3 offers good sound quality, it's nowhere close to a dedicated high-end studio microphone — so you'll be hard pressed to notice any difference.\nDJI also added internal dual-file 24-bit and 32-bit float recording, which records the highest quality possible without any clipping. That allows you to capture two files of 32-bit float sound without algorithmic changes, two channels of 24-bit sound with algorithmic changes or one of each. That's an improvement over the Mic 2, which only captured a single file of the original sound internally in 32-bit float. \n\n\n\n\n  DJI\n \n\nThere's one key feature missing on DJI's Mic 3 that might make it a non-starter for some audio pros. Unlike the Mic 2, the transmitter lacks a 3.5mm mic port for wired lav or other microphones. That means you're relying on the Mic 3's built in microphone, and although it offers high quality sound, may not be high enough for applications like broadcast. \nFinally, the Mic 3 works with DJI's OsmoAudio system, so it pairs with the Osmo 360, Osmo Action 5 Pro, Action 4 and Osmo Pocket without the need for a receiver. I tested it with the Osmo 360 and Action 5 Pro and it connected without any issues. For other devices, you can wire it in via a 3.5mm TRS port, TRRS monitoring and a USB-C port, or to smartphones via Bluetooth or USB-C using the included adapter. \nDJI's Mic 3 is now on sale in most territories, priced at $329 in a kit with a charging case plus two transmitters and a receiver, or $219 with a single transmitter and receiver.\n\n\nUpdate, August 28, 2025, 9:45AM ET: This story was updated with US sales links. DJI originally said the Mic 3 wasn't available in the US yet, but the company changed course and the new product can be purchased from DJI or Amazon.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/djis-much-smaller-mic-3-can-record-four-subjects-at-once-120032192.html?src=rss",

You can grab it for $150 off at Amazon right now.\nThis deal applies to each configuration of the 11-inch and 13-inch versions of the most recent iPad Air. So, the 11-inch model is as low as $449, while the 13-inch model is down to $649. The same deals can be found at Best Buy and Target if you prefer to shop somewhere other than Amazon. This is an all-time low price and beats the deal we saw on Prime Day by $30. \n \nThe iPad Air M3 is more of an iterative refresh than a grand overhaul, but the spec bump means it’ll last you a long time before the tablet’s performance becomes a problem. This iPad occupies the position of \"best for most\" in our iPad buying guide, reinforcing that goldilocks analogy. The M3 chip is the main draw here, with Geekbench 6 scores proclaiming it around 16 percent more powerful than the M2 iPad Air, which is no slouch itself.\nBeyond the chip, it has a superior display and speakers to the entry-level model, and wider accessory support. You also get the option of a 13-inch display, which is great for artists or anyone who sees the iPad as a viable laptop replacement.\nIf there’s an obvious downside to the iPad Air M3, it’s that it doesn't have the nice 120Hz OLED display of the iPad Pro. This is hardly surprising, as Apple often focuses on display tech to differentiate its Pro and non-Pro devices, but it’s probably time the refresh rate on the middle-of-the-road iPad at least jumped up to ProMotion. Face ID is long overdue too. If you can live with these caveats, though, the iPad Air is an excellent option, particularly at this price.\nIf you think the Air is too much for your needs, the iPad A16, Apple's entry-level tablet, is down to $299 right now. It was slightly cheaper during Prime Day in July, but this discount is still worth considering if you're looking to pick up a newer iPad for less.\n \nCheck out our coverage of the best Apple deals for more discounts, and follow @EngadgetDeals on X for the latest tech deals and buying advice.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/apples-ipad-air-m3-gets-a-150-discount-for-labor-day-162908706.html?src=rss",

Now, the company is believed to be developing a new chip for China that's more advanced than the H20 and is based on the company's Blackwell architecture.

    "summary": "Early this summer, my wife and I had an inconvenient realization: we may need to be in two places at once. An urgent doctor appointment could conflict with YMCA day camp pickup, or our kids would get invited to two birthday parties on the same morning at godforsaken activity centers in separate towns. There was no doubt we needed another car. A big ticket purchase seemed unjustifiable when we don't know what eggs will cost next month — and my search for an aftermarket Prius within my budget was strangely fruitless. As it turns out though, now might be the best time to grab a used EV.\nDuring my search, I saw BMW i3s (those freakish go-kart looking EVs) and VW e-Golfs selling for around $15,000, both of which are more fun to drive and have better tech features than older Prii. Couple those low prices with the soon-to-be-expired EV tax credit — which can get you up to $4,000 off certain used EVs and plug-in hybrids (PHEVS) — and some cars could cost $10,000 or less! Meanwhile, I couldn't find a decent 2015 Prius below $17,000.\nLong story short, I settled on a boring-yet-secretly-fun option: A 2018 Nissan Leaf. It has a range of 150 miles and a hatchback design that looks less funky than the original bug-eyed sub-compact. It accelerates quickly, it's relatively engaging to drive and it also has premium leather seats, radar-assisted cruise control and a decent Bose speaker system. Not bad for something close to $15,000 with only 33,000 miles!\nEven though it's worth far less than our stately Volvo XC90, I genuinely have more fun zipping around town in the Nissan Leaf. There's the magic of the instant torque you get from its electric motor, the convenience of one-pedal driving (Nissan calls it \"e-pedal\") and its cherry red paint lets me pretend I'm having a mid-life Miata crisis like my middle school rhetoric teacher. Plus it can easily fit a large toddler car seat and a booster for my six-year old, and it has enough trunk space to deal with massive grocery hauls. Thank god I didn't get a Prius.\nDevindra Hardawar for Engadget\nWhy are used EVs so cheap?\nMany EVs just don't hold their value — you can blame the fast-evolving EV components and consumer uncertainty for that. But that also means you can find gently used models for far less than their list price. If I was less responsible and pushed my budget a bit higher, I'd absolutely consider a recent Hyundai Ioniq 5 for around $25,000. It's well-reviewed, and it looks like an '80s retro-future hatchback. What's not to love?\n(And yes, you could also look for used Teslas if you want. I can't vouch for the quality of that brand, and personally I wouldn't recommend getting stuck in its ecosystem.)\nYou can find even deeper discounts for less popular cars, like the Polestar 2 (which would honestly look great in my driveway next to its Volvo cousin). That luxury EV started at $61,000 at launch — but now it's easy to find used Polestar 2s for around $25,000.\nNo matter which used EV you're looking at, be sure to check out its battery health level. Most early EVs relied on air cooling for their batteries, and their chemistry isn't advanced as modern cars, which means degradation can be common. You can typically find a battery health indicator in a car's settings, but OBD sensors and apps like LeafSpy may provide a more accurate sense of their longevity.\n\nSo long, EV tax credit\nThe Biden-era EV tax credit can also shave off up to $4,000 from select used EVs and $7,500 from new models, but unfortunately thanks to Trump's \"Big Beautiful Bill\" it's likely to be discontinued at the end of September. I've seen some dealers highlight cars eligible for tax credits, and that's also true for online stores like Carvana. Just be sure to check the IRS requirements — notably, the new vehicle credit only applies for individuals earning less than $150,000 and married couples filing jointly who earn less than $300,000.\nThe used vehicle credit is even more restrictive, as it only applies to individuals earning less than $75,000 and married joint filers earning under $150,000. Additionally, qualifying EVs have to be priced under $25,000, and must be 2023 models or older. You'll also have to buy the used EV from a dealer — personal sales don't apply.\n\nHow I learned to deal with range anxiety\nOne major reason older EVs have gotten cheaper is that they often offer relatively low driving ranges. The 2021 BMW i3 can run up to 153 miles, but older models topped out at 85 miles (there are also Range Extender models that use a small gas engine to slowly recharge the battery). My 2018 Leaf tops out at 150 miles, but there are also \"Leaf Plus\" models that can reach up to 226 miles.\nThose numbers are a long way off from the 300-miles or so we expect from new EVs and gas cars, but I'd also argue the shorter range isn't a huge deal for many people. US DOT data tells us that 95 percent of trips in personal vehicles cover less than 31 miles, and the average driver travels 37 miles per day. That makes low-range EVs ideal as secondary vehicles for local driving.\nBetween day-care pickup, grabbing groceries and other local errands, I rarely drive more than 20 miles a day in my Leaf. That typically eats up only 10 to 15 percent of charge per day, depending on how much I need to blast the AC to deal with Georgia summers.\nNow I won't deny that you wouldn't want to go road tripping with a low-range EV, especially with America's messy charging infrastructure. Low-range EVs aren't for everyone. But if that's your worry, I'd just recommend avoiding the cheap sub-$15,000 used EVs. You'll find plenty of models with bigger batteries near $25,000.\nDevindra Hardawar for Engadget\nCharging might be easier than you think\nIf you can string a 25 foot power cord outside, you can easily Level 1 trickle charge an EV. And for moderate drivers, that may be all they need to keep their car juiced up. If I plug in my Nissan Leaf at 5PM, it can typically charge up by 40 percent by 8AM, thanks to its small battery. For larger EVs like the Kia EV9, I can usually get 10 to 15 percent of a charge overnight.\nOf course, things become more complicated if you're in your car all day and need faster charging, or if extreme weather causes your battery to drain faster than usual. At that point, you'll either have to seek out a public charging point, or get a Level 2 charger installed at home. Neither option is especially difficult, but they're more annoying than simply going to a gas station for a few minutes. I wouldn't be surprised if that's the big stumbling block pushing mainstream shoppers away from EVs.\nFrom what I've seen, though, many people are just hesitant to break their existing habits. If you have the ability to install a Level 2 charger in your garage, it's not especially difficult or expensive (though running an extra power line could be a big spend). And EV chargers are also popping up like weeds in shopping centers, so it may not be that tough to park up and charge while running errands.\nIn my case, I’m perfectly fine running a Level 1 charger to an outlet near my front door. That does mean I’ll occasionally have a thick electrical cord draped across my front porch (something I’m sure my wife just loves), but I can live with it for now. I do plan to get a Level 2 charger installed eventually though — it’ll make testing EVs a lot easier, and I can prepare myself for a more spacious family EV to replace our gas guzzling SUV.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/its-the-perfect-time-to-buy-a-cheap-used-ev-123015687.html?src=rss",

At this point, if you subscribe to all the major services out there, you're basically paying the same price as cable — those antiquated local monopolies that streaming was supposed to save us from. But streaming still has one big advantage over the old ways: no contracts. That means you can grab a good streaming deal and then cancel without penalty.\nOur advice is to sign up for a service when you see a good streaming deal (or the latest season of, say, Doctor Who, Severance, Andor and/or The Last of Us). Then, when the deal ends or you've binged whatever it is you want to watch, cancel as needed. But streaming deals don't come around all that often and, when they do, it's easy to miss them thanks to...everything. So we're keeping eyes out for the best streaming deals out there and we update this guide often — so check it out the next time you have a hankering to watch something new. \nBest streaming deals\nTrue streaming deals can be hard to come by. Most often, they’ll pop up during the Black Friday shopping period. On occasion, we’ll see them sparingly throughout the year and they usually take the form of a discounted monthly or annual rate for a limited period of time. Also, true streaming deals are typically on the ad-supported versions of a service, but once in a while you’ll find a unicorn of a deal on a tier that has ad-free viewing.\nIf you’re able to wait for a deal before subscribing to a streaming service, we recommend doing so. You’ll save money upfront and in the long run, and you also have the option to cancel your subscription before the price goes back up to the normal rate. Maybe you find you like the service so much that you’re fine paying full price for it — that’s the ideal situation. But if you’re not compelled to keep that app on rotation in your smart TV, most streaming services make it easy for you to cancel at any time. With that said, these are the best streaming deals you can snag right now.\n\n\nDirecTV starting at $50/month for one month ($35 off): All of DirecTV's signature packages are $35 off right now for your first month when you sign up. If you opt for the base \"Entertainment\" package, you'll spend $50 for the first month and get access to over 90 channels, including many local stations as well as ESPN, ESPN 2 and Fox Sports 1. You'll also be able to watch on the go with the DirecTV mobile app.\nDashPass Annual + HBO Max (with ads) for $96/year ($144 off): This offer includes access to HBO Max with ads for no extra cost when you sign up for a DashPass Annual plan. You can then decide to upgrade to Max Standard, which removes ads, for a discounted rate of $11 monthly if you want. Aside from the obvious streaming benefits, this deal gives you $0 deliver fees and lower service fees on some restaurant DoorDash orders, five percent DoorDash credits on pickup orders, on-demand grocery delivery and other members-only exclusives.\nSpotify Premium Individual (3 month) for $0 ($36 off): This is our favorite music streaming service for podcasts and social features. Right now, users who have not signed up for Spotify's Premium service before are eligible to get three months for free. The Premium Individual plan lets you listen ad-free and skip songs at will. You can also organize your listening queue and download content for offline listening. Just be aware, your subscription will auto-renew at the end of the trial period. So if you don't want to be on the hook for the $12 monthly fee, set a reminder to cancel and go back to the free version.\nFubo Pro for $55/month for the first month ($30 off): Fubo has introductory discounts on most of its packages, and the Pro package is the least expensive plan currently listed. It offers access to 224 channels, unlimited cloud DVR and up to 10 simultaneous streams. It even includes regional sports content from the NHL, MLB and NBA.\nYouTube TV (three months) for $150 ($99 off): You can get three months of our favorite live TV streaming service for $50 per month. That should give you a decent chunk of time to see if the service is right for you while saving some cash. The discount and trial are only open to new subscribers to YouTube TV’s base plan, which includes access to over 100 channels, unlimited DVR space and six household accounts with the ability to stream on three devices at once. \nSling Orange for $23/month for the first month (50 percent off): New customers can get Sling Orange or Sling Blue for half off the usual price for the first month, bringing the final prices to $23/month and $25.50/month, respectively. Orange is likely best for sports fans, with eight exclusive sports and family channels, while Blue includes 19 exclusive news and entertainment channels. You can get both Orange and Blue access also for half off for one month, or $33 total.\nPeacock first responders discount — one year for $48 (50 percent off): Medical professionals and first responders can save 50 percent each year of Peacock. The deal requires annual verification and is open to those who work for either private or public institutions. Peacock has some great stuff to watch, including Poker Face and Killing It and more.\nStudent discounts on streaming services\nHBO Max student discount — subscribe for $5/month (50 percent off): HBO Max offers their ad-supported tier to students for half off the usual rate. You’ll just have to verify that you’re a student through Unidays, and make note that this offer is only good for up to 12 months of service.\nHulu student discount — subscribe for $2/month (75 percent off): Those with a valid student ID can get Hulu’s ad-supported tier for 75 percent off the typical rate. They’ll keep the same sale price for as long as they’re a student as well.\nSpotify student discount — Premium + Hulu with ads for $6/month (72 percent off): Spotify’s student offer continues to be one of the best around, giving you access to the Premium tier of the music streamer and Hulu’s ad-supported plan for only $6 monthly. Purchased separately, you’d pay $22 per month for both of the services. Plus, the first month is free when you sign up.\nNBA League Pass student discount — one year for $120 (40 percent off): Students can get one year of League Pass for only $10 per month, which includes access to NBA TV and the ability to watch classic and archive games on-demand. On the NBA League Pass website, look for the student discount banner at the top and follow the instructions to verify your student status.\nStreaming bundle discounts\nThere’s more consolidation happening now than ever before in the streaming space, and that means there are more streaming bundle options. These bundles offer you access to more content with one subscription price, but those prices are typically higher than paying for a single service by itself (obviously). It may be tempting to just get the bundle, but if only one of those services in the bundle speaks to you, you’ll spend less overall by just paying for the single service.\nSpeaking of a deep love for a single streaming service: if all of your favorite shows are on Peacock or the latest releases on HBO Max consistently bring you joy, consider paying for one year upfront. Subscribing with an annual plan usually saves you money in the long term over paying on a monthly basis. Unfortunately, not all streaming services (looking at you, Netflix) have an annual subscription option. Here are some of the best streaming bundles you can get right now.\n\n\nDisney+, Hulu, HBO Max bundle with ads for $17/month: Ad-supported HBO Max is included here, along with full, ad-supported access to Disney+ and Hulu. You’ll save 43 percent with this bundle, as opposed to paying for all three services individually.\nDisney+ and Hulu Bundle Premium for $20/month: Disney and Hulu offer a few different bundles, which you can view in the drop-down lists under Choose Your Plan. This bundle removes the ads from both Disney+ and Hulu (with the exception of select live and linear content) and allows you to download content for offline viewing. You’ll save 42 percent with this bundle, as opposed to paying for both ad-free tiers individually.\nHulu + Live TV with Disney+ and ESPN+ for $96/month: This streaming bundle amalgamation is a bit confusing but it does offer a lot: you get live TV streaming via Hulu’s service plus access to the following VOD services: Hulu, Disney+ and ESPN+. Out of those three, only ESPN+ will have ads.\nDisney+, Hulu, ESPN+ Bundle Basic for $17/month: You get full access to Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+ content with this package, albeit with ads across the board. This bundle price is 46 percent off the total price of all three separate subscriptions.\nDisney+, Hulu, ESPN+ Bundle Premium for $27/month: Similarly to the Duo bundles, the Premium version of the Trio removes ads from most content in Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+, and you can download content for offline viewing. This price represents a 43-percent savings when compared to paying for all three ad-free tiers separately.\nSling TV + HBO Max starting at $53/month: Sling TV and HBO Max have partnered on a discount that gives new subscribers 50 percent off their first month of Sling TV, plus $5 off monthly when you subscribe to the Sling TV + HBO Max bundle. The standard price for the Sling Blue + HBO Max duo is roughly $58/month, so you'll get a monthly discount of $5 off that. In addition, for the first month only, you'll get half off the price of the bundle. The promotion also applies to the Sling Orange & Blue + HBO Max package, which has a standard price of $73/month.\nParamount+ with Showtime for $13/month or $120/year: This includes everything in Paramount+’s Essential plan, except the ads, and also provides access to Showtime content, live CBS streams and download features.\nRead more streaming coverage\n\nThe best live TV streaming services to cut cable\nThe best streaming services: Netflix, Hulu, HBO Max and more\nThe best streaming devices\n\nFollow @EngadgetDeals on X for the latest tech deals and buying advice.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/best-streaming-service-deals-133028980.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "If your Wi-Fi signal is struggling to reach every corner of your home, a signal booster — also known as a Wi-Fi extender — might be the fix you need. Whether you're dealing with annoying dead zones, buffering video calls or laggy gaming sessions, the right Wi-Fi extender can help expand coverage and improve connectivity without forcing you to move your router.There are different types of Wi-Fi extenders to choose from. Some models use external antennas to push the signal farther, while others, like mesh extenders, create a seamless, whole-home network. If you're simply looking to extend coverage into a specific room, a Wi-Fi repeater can do the job — but it may cut your bandwidth in half. More advanced extenders, however, can help maintain strong speeds and reliability throughout your home.We've rounded up the best Wi-Fi extenders to suit different needs, whether you're looking for an affordable fix or a high-performance upgrade.\nTable of contents\n\nBest Wi-Fi extender for 2025\nHow do Wi-Fi extenders work?\nWhat to look for in a Wi-Fi extender\nWi-Fi extender FAQs\n\nBest Wi-Fi extender for 2025\n \n \n \nHow do Wi-Fi extenders work?\nThese handy wireless devices do exactly what their name suggests: extend your Wi-Fi network so it covers more areas of your home. Most wireless extenders plug into an AC outlet and connect to your existing router so they can then rebroadcast it to spots that your router alone may not cover well. As a rule of thumb, you’ll get the best results by placing the extender half way between your router and the dead zone you’re trying to fix or improve your W-Fi connection and strengthen the wireless signal. \nOne important thing to note about Wi-Fi range extenders (also sometimes called “repeaters”) is that most of them actually create a new Wi-Fi network when rebroadcasting your existing one. That network will have a new name (it’ll often be your default network’s name with an EXT appended at the end, unless you change it) and that means you’ll have to connect to different networks when in different parts of your home. While that’s a small tradeoff in return for improved internet connection, some will be more inconvenienced than others.\nIf you’d rather have one, much larger network in your home, you’re better off upgrading to mesh networking systems. Mesh systems come with a main router and a wireless access point or two that, by default, create one large Wi-Fi system that should be accessible throughout your whole home. They tend to be the best Wi-Fi routers you can get, but that also translates to more expensive, and possibly more complicated, devices. Mesh Wi-Fi systems are, by far, more costly than a simple extender, plus you may have to work with your internet service provider to get your home’s existing network working on your new router.\nWhat to look for in a Wi-Fi extender\nSpeed\nExtenders today can support single, dual or tri-band Wi-Fi, and they will tell you the maximum speeds they support on all of their available bands. For example, one dual-band device might support 600Mbps speeds over its 2.4GHz band and up to 1300Mbps over its 5GHz band, for a combined maximum speed of 1900Mbps. For the best performance, you’ll want to go with a Wi-Fi extender that has the highest speeds possible (and those, as you might expect, tend to cost more). Some extenders even support Wi-Fi 7, giving you the latest in wireless technology for higher bandwidth, faster internet speed and lower latency.\nHowever, it’s important to remember that Wi-Fi extenders are not true “signal boosters” since they are not designed to increase speeds across your home. In fact, you may find that the extender’s network is slower than your router’s. Instead, extenders are designed to increase the strong Wi-Fi coverage throughout your home, making them ideal for filling in dead zones. Some mesh extenders can help create a more seamless network, reducing the drop in speed and improving connectivity in larger spaces.\nRange, and number of supported devices\nWith the name of the gaming being coverage area, taking note of a device’s range is important. Depending on the size of your home and property, you may only need up to 1,200 square feet of coverage. But those with larger homes will want to spring for an extender that can support upwards of 2,000+ square feet of coverage.\nSimilarly, those with lots of gadgets will want an extender that can handle them all at once. If you spend most of your time on your phone or laptop and maybe have your smart TV online for a few hours of Netflix each day, you could get by with a more limited extender. Smart home aficionados and tech lovers should invest in one that won’t buckle under the pressure of a few dozen connected devices. This is especially important if you plan on linking all of the devices in a certain part of your home to your Wi-Fi range extender’s network, rather than directly to your existing router. Some models with external antennas can improve performance by providing stronger, more directional wireless signal.\nDesign\nThere isn’t a ton of innovation when it comes to design in the Wi-Fi extender space. Most of the ones you’ll find today are rounded rectangles roughly the size of your hand that plug into a standard wall outlet. They usually have a few indicator lights that will show you when the extender is connected, how strong its signal strength is and when there’s a problem, and some will even have moveable external antennas that companies claim provide even better Wi-Fi signal. Generally, they are pretty simple to install and get connected, but if you’re struggling with how to set up your Wi-Fi extender, there are plenty of YouTube videos you can check out.\nAside from that, there are the scant few standalone Wi-Fi extenders that sit on an end table or a desk, and those look pretty similar to regular ol’ routers. But make no mistake, anything labeled as an extender or a “Wi-Fi repeater” will need an anchor router in order for it to work.\nAnother convenient feature you’ll find on most Wi-Fi extenders is an extra Ethernet connection port (or a few). This allows you to use the extender as a wireless access point if you connect it to your existing router, or an adapter to provide devices like TVs, smart home hubs or game consoles a hardwired connection to the internet. Unsurprisingly, this wired connection usually provides you with the fastest speeds possible, so you may want to use it for your most crucial devices.\nWi-Fi extender FAQs\nWhat's the difference between a wifi booster and extender?\nNowadays, there’s really no difference between a Wi-Fi booster and Wi-Fi extender - they’re just different names for the same thing. Previously, however, Wi-Fi boosters were devices that received signals from wireless routers, broadcasting them to another network. This essentially extends the range of the signal. Wi-Fi extenders expand the coverage within your home’s Wi-Fi network, but often you will see extenders described as boosters.\nIs a Wi-Fi extender better than a mesh router?\nMesh routers, or mesh Wi-Fi systems, use multiple devices (or nodes) across your home to create a larger home network. Essentially, you have multiple routers around your home with these systems, and that will hopefully provide the best coverage possible. Wi-Fi extenders, on the other hand, are usually just one device that extends your existing Wi-Fi signal, and they often require you to switch networks when connecting. Wi-Fi extenders are more affordable, though, and are great if you’re traveling or need a Wi-Fi signal in harder-to-reach areas. However, a mesh router can offer a better long-term solution to upgrade your entire home’s Wi-Fi.\nShould I use multiple Wi-Fi extenders?\nSome people may need to use multiple Wi-Fi extenders, for instance, if your home is large or has dead zones in different areas. But if you do use multiple Wi-Fi extenders, there’s a chance of interference. You may also need to manually connect to the extenders separately, which isn’t always convenient.\nWhat is the maximum distance for a Wi-Fi extender?\nThe maximum distance for a Wi-Fi extender varies depending on the model, but most can effectively extend your wireless signal between 800 and 2,500 square feet. Some high-end models may reach even farther, especially if they feature external antennas or are part of a mesh system with additional dedicated wireless access points.\nHowever, keep in mind that real-world performance depends on factors like your home's layout, wall materials and interference from other devices. For best results, place your extender about halfway between your router and the area with weak or no Wi-Fi connection. Always check the manufacturer’s specs — some of our top picks clearly list their expected range so you can find one that fits your space.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/best-wifi-extender-130021313.html?src=rss",

Only our top pick (see below) got close to my router’s standard speeds, but I expected this. It’s a dual-band, Wi-Fi 6e mesh range extender that will work with pretty much any wireless router you may have. For example, my den’s TV shows up as “LGwebOSTV” and our soundbar in our basement shows up as “sonyaudio” — but there are a number of connected devices with no name at all, and we’re just stuck with that.

    "summary": "Figuring out the best iPad for you can be tricky. Apple now sells three 11-inch tablets and two 13-inch ones, each with key differences in pricing, specs and accessory support. The iPad mini is still hanging around, too. Ahead of the big changes coming with the iPadOS 26 update later this year, we’ve tested each current iPad and broken down which ones best fit different needs, whether you want a laptop replacement or just a big screen for streaming.\nTable of contents\n\nThe best iPads for 2025\nHow we test the best iPads\niPad FAQs\nRecent updates\n\nThe best iPads for 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow we test the best iPads\n\n\n\n  The top edge of the iPad mini.\n \n\n  Photo by Nathan Ingraham / Engadget\n \n\nMuch like we do for our guide to the best tablets overall, we spend several days with each iPad to see how they feel and perform with different tasks: watching videos, web browsing, playing both casual and graphically intense games, editing 4K photos and video, running multiple apps side-by-side, making FaceTime calls and the like. To better measure performance specifically, we use benchmarking tests like Geekbench 6, 3DMark and GFXBench Metal, plus we measure how long it takes for each tablet to boot up and open various apps. We also check how well each tablet holds up long-term, whether it’s with a review unit provided by Apple or an iPad model that’s owned by a member of the Engadget staff. \nTo help compare the color performance and brightness of the displays, we play the same videos on different iPads, side-by-side, at equal brightness levels. We use each tablet in direct sunlight outdoors to see how well they hold up to glare, and we play a handful of the same musical tracks to evaluate speaker performance. For battery life, we keep track of how long each tablet generally lasts before it needs a recharge, but we also play a 1080p movie on a loop at roughly 70 percent brightness with power-sapping background processes off. We also test each device with an Apple Pencil and note how responsive the stylus feels. Finally, we carefully pore over spec sheets and software updates to keep track of which features are available on certain iPads but not others.\niPad FAQs\n\n\n\n  The iPad (A16) on top of an 13-inch iPad Air.\n \n\n  Jeff Dunn for Engadget\n \n\nWhat are some new features coming to iPadOS 26?\nApple first previewed iPadOS 26 during its WWDC keynote in June. The update looks to be a major overhaul, one that brings iPadOS closer to macOS than ever before. New features include the ability to open more windows simultaneously and resize or tile them more freely; a Mac-style Menu bar; a dedicated Preview app; an upgraded Files app; an improved ability to export or download large files in the background; an Exposé view that shows all open windows; a pointier cursor and the option to add folders to the Dock. It’ll also use the new “liquid glass” design language Apple is rolling out across all of its platforms in 2025. Importantly, Apple says these features will be available across its tablet lineup, from the iPad Pro to the entry-level iPad. That could make the latter a particularly enticing value. You can find the full list of compatible devices at the bottom of Apple’s press release.\nHow long do iPads typically last?\nIf history is any indication, expect Apple to update your iPad to the latest version of iPadOS for at least five years, if not longer. The current iPadOS 18 update, for example, is available on iPad Pro models dating back to 2018 and other iPads dating back to 2019. How long your iPad’s hardware will last depends on which model you buy and how well you maintain it. (If you’re particularly clumsy, consider an iPad case.) A more powerful iPad Pro will feel fast for a longer time than an entry-level iPad, but each model should remain at least serviceable until Apple stops updating it, at minimum.\nWhat’s the difference between the iPad and the iPad Air?\nCompared to the 11th-gen iPad, the iPad Air runs on a stronger M3 chip (instead of the A16 Bionic) and has 2GB more RAM (8GB total). Both come with 128GB of storage by default. The Air is also available in two sizes, 11 and 13 inches, whereas the 11th-gen iPad doesn't offer the larger screen option. The M-series SoC gives the Air better long-term performance, plus access to certain iPadOS features such as Apple Intelligence and Stage Manager. Its display supports a wider P3 color gamut, has an antireflective coating and is fully laminated. The latter means there’s no “air gap” between the display and the glass covering it, so it feels more like you’re directly touching what’s on screen instead of interacting with an image below the glass. The Air also works with the newer Pencil Pro stylus and more comfortable Magic Keyboards, and its USB-C port supports faster data transfer speeds. It technically supports faster Wi-Fi 6E, too, while the lower-cost iPad uses Wi-Fi 6.  \nStarting at $349, the 11th-gen iPad is $250 less expensive than the iPad Air. It has a similarly elegant design with flat edges, thin bezels, USB-C port, and a Touch ID reader. Battery life is rated at the same 10 hours, and both devices have their front-facing camera on their long edge, which is a more natural position for video calls. The cheaper iPad works with the first-gen and USB-C Apple Pencils – which are more convoluted to charge – and a unique keyboard accessory called the Magic Keyboard Folio.\n\n\n\n\n  Jeff Dunn for Engadget\n \n\nWhat’s the difference between iPads and Android tablets?\nThe operating system, duh. But to give a few more specifics: Android devices are available from more manufacturers and cover a wider price range. You won’t see an $80 iPad anytime soon. Android is also more malleable in that you can easily sideload apps from places beyond Google’s official app store and more extensively customize the look of the OS. Several Android tablets still have features like a headphone jack or a microSD slot for adding storage, too, though those are getting rarer.\nBut we tend to recommend Apple tablets to those who have no allegiance either way. iPad apps are still a bit more likely to be designed specifically for larger screens, rather than looking like blown-up phone software, and Apple is just about peerless when it comes to long-term software support. Every new iPad hits a certain baseline of hardware quality and performance — none of them feel cheap, and all of them are fast enough for most needs. Plus, you’ll get the most out of an iPad if you use other Apple devices.\nCan an iPad replace a laptop?\nThis is a loaded question, since laptop workflows differ from person to person. If you mostly use a notebook for browsing the web, watching videos or writing emails and word docs, then sure, you can get along just fine with an iPad and the right iPad accessories. It’ll be easier to carry around, the battery life is great and having the touchscreen and stylus support is handy (though many Windows users have that regardless). Even beyond the basics, plenty of media editors, graphic designers and digital artists have shown they can get things done on an iPad.\nBroadly speaking, though, a laptop OS tends to be more flexible when it comes to file management, multitasking, coding or other “heavy” tasks. Safari on the iPad isn’t quite on par with desktop browsers either. So the answer really depends on you. That said, the iPadOS 26 update could close the gap, so check back on this in a couple of months.\nHow do I take a screenshot on an iPad?\nAs we note in our screenshot how-to guide, you can take a screenshot on your iPad by pressing the top button and either volume button at the same time. If you have an older iPad with a Home button, simultaneously press the top button and the Home button instead.\nRecent updates\nAugust 2025: We've taken another sweep to ensure our picks are still accurate and added a few more notes to our FAQ section.\nJune 2025: We’ve made a few minor edits to reflect the announcement of Apple’s latest iPadOS update, which we detail above.\nMay 2025: We’ve lightly edited this guide to ensure all details and links are still correct. We’re also keeping an eye on how the Trump administration’s tariff policy affects the pricing and stock of the iPad lineup (and every other tech category). All of our picks are still available at normal prices today, but we’ll update this guide if that changes.\nMarch 2025: We've reviewed the iPad (A16) and named it our new budget pick, removing the discontinued 10th-gen iPad in the process. \nMarch 2025: The recently-launched iPad Air M3 has replaced its predecessor as our top overall recommendation. We’ve also made a note regarding the new iPad (A16), which we plan to test in the near future and expect to become our new budget pick. We’ve made a handful of edits elsewhere in the guide to reflect Apple’s latest hardware.\nJanuary 2025: We’ve lightly edited this guide for clarity. Our recommendations remain the same.\nOctober 2024: We've updated our guide to include the new iPad mini 7.\nJune 2024: We’ve touched up this guide to reflect some of the new iPadOS features Apple announced at WWDC, though our picks remain the same.\nNathan Ingraham contributed to this report.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/best-ipads-how-to-pick-the-best-apple-tablet-for-you-150054066.html?src=rss",
    "full_text": "Ahead of the big changes coming with the iPadOS 26 update later this year, we’ve tested each current iPad and broken down which ones best fit different needs, whether you want a laptop replacement or just a big screen for streaming. As before, it has an 8.3-inch Liquid Retina display that’s easier to use with one hand. Those looking to use the iPad Pro as a (very expensive) media consumption device don’t need this, but if you work with memory-hungry apps or need the absolute best, just note it’ll cost you. It’s the only one with a Thunderbolt USB-C port, which is technically faster for transferring large files. Finally, we carefully pore over spec sheets and software updates to keep track of which features are available on certain iPads but not others. It’ll also use the new “liquid glass” design language Apple is rolling out across all of its platforms in 2025. Its display supports a wider P3 color gamut, has an antireflective coating and is fully laminated. May 2025: We’ve lightly edited this guide to ensure all details and links are still correct. All of our picks are still available at normal prices today, but we’ll update this guide if that changes. March 2025: The recently-launched iPad Air M3 has replaced its predecessor as our top overall recommendation."
