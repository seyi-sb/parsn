    "full_text": "Instagram accounts that primarily feature images of children, but are run by adult users, will no longer be recommended to “potentially suspicious adults.” The update was announced in a blog post detailing the latest expansion of Meta’s child safety features, which includes new blocking and reporting capabilities for teenagers and additional protections for adult-managed accounts that feature children. This comes after a 2023 lawsuit accused Facebook and Instagram of becoming a “marketplace for predators in search of children,” claiming that Meta’s platforms “allowed users to search for, like, share, and sell a crushing volume of [child sexual abuse material].” The same year, an investigation by The Wall Street Journal found that Instagram’s recommendation algorithms were actively promoting networks of pedophiles. Meta has since introduced a variety of online safety features for Facebook and Instagram users who are under 18, and some of these are now being expanded to adults who frequently post images of children — a group that Meta says frequently includes parents and talent managers. Instagram will now “avoid recommending” such accounts to suspicious adults, such as those who have been blocked by teens, and in turn avoid steering suspected creeps to adult-run accounts featuring children. The app will also hide comments from potentially suspicious adults on their posts, and make it harder for both kinds of accounts to find each other in Search. While Meta says that these adult-managed accounts are “overwhelmingly used in benign ways,” the company has also been accused of knowingly allowing parents who sexually exploit their children for financial gain on Facebook and Instagram to remain on the platforms. Hiding potential predators from adult accounts featuring kids builds on Meta’s update last year that stopped accounts that heavily feature children from offering subscriptions or receiving gifts. Other Teen Account features that are coming to accounts featuring kids in the coming months will automatically default them to Instagram’s strictest message settings and filter out offensive and inappropriate comments. Some additional safety features are rolling out to Instagram DMs that provide Teen accounts with a combined report and block option. Teen users will now also see the month and year that the account they’re messaging with joined Instagram to help them spot potential creeps and scammers."

That's happening against a backdrop of rising costs for consumers. Meanwhile, the gaming industry is projected to reach $189 billion this year, a 3.4 percent increase.

    "full_text": "Open source X and Threads competitor Mastodon will begin experimenting with a new way to raise funds: in-app donations. The organization on Wednesday announced it’s launching a campaign that introduces banners inside its Android and iOS apps, prompting users to make a monetary donation. These banners will be easy to dismiss, Mastodon says, and will only be shown to people who have accounts that have existed for at least four weeks. The organization promises that it won’t continually prompt users to donate, either. Such campaigns can work well for nonprofit organizations at scale. Still, the banners could encourage people who haven’t actively sought out ways to contribute to now do so, as it makes the process more seamless as an in-app feature. The latter would allow individual server admins to receive direct support from their own users, which could help keep them operational. It has also accepted a handful of donations from open-source-focused funds and foundations over the years. That decline could have pushed it to look into more aggressive fundraising tactics, especially as competition from Meta and newcomers like the VC-backed startup Bluesky is growing. “We know that collecting money can present complexities and questions,” a Mastodon blog post stated."

Although not nearly as straightforward as downloading the VPN app directly to your device, getting a VPN set up on Roku is relatively easy -- and there’s a good chance that you already have the necessary equipment to make it work. Alternatively, you can share a mobile hotspot from your Windows or Mac computer. However, even though many VPNs have tutorials on how to do this on a variety of router models, it can still be a tricky process and probably risky to try if you’re not particularly technically inclined. If you’re an ExpressVPN user, you can purchase its Aircove router, which comes in a portable version for $170 or a standard size for $190. Simply connect your Roku or any other device (whether it supports VPN apps or not) to your VPN router network and you’re good to go. Using one of the methods outlined above, most any VPN would technically work with your Roku device. If you want the best VPN for streaming overall, ExpressVPN is a great option.

    "summary": "2024 was an awful year for Sonos. Its long-awaited entry into a crowded headphones market was eclipsed by a bungled app launch which had a knock-on effect that impacted everything the company had planned to do for the rest of the year. Plus, those Ace headphones were missing a major feature.\nOne year later, that TrueCinema spatial audio enhancement is finally ready. And with that update, Sonos added a few more improvements to the Ace, including two-person TV Audio Swap, adaptive noise cancellation and better calls. I spent some time testing every aspect of the update that arrived in June to determine if Sonos’ headphones really are better after the tweaks.\nTrueCinema is finally here\nThe first time I tried the Ace at a press event last spring, TrueCinema was one of the main parts of the demo. From the jump, Sonos was clear this wouldn’t arrive when the headphones first went on sale, but I also didn’t expect the company to take a full year to have it ready.\nAs a refresher, TrueCinema is a feature for the Ace that takes into account the acoustics of the room where one of its soundbars is located. It then creates spatial audio for the headphones based on that info when TV Audio Swap is active. According to Sonos, it supposedly “understands the dynamics of your space, acoustically treats it and makes it sound like you have a beautifully tuned 3D audio system right in your headphones.” It’s similar to the company’s TruePlay tuning that calibrates its soundbars to your living room or home theater space.\nSonos has championed TrueCinema as a more realistic listening experience. Since it simulates the characteristics of the room, it’s supposed to make it seem like you aren’t wearing headphones at all. I’m not convinced on that point, but the feature does significantly enhance the spatial audio capabilities of the Ace for TV Audio Swap.\nFor example, subtle details in movies — things like footsteps, as well as various beeps, clicks and taps in Rogue One — are a lot more obvious with TrueCinema. There’s more overall depth and direction to the sound as well, which makes this the optimal mode for watching TV or movies with Sonos’ headphones. I’m confident my review score would’ve been higher if this was part of the original package since it makes such an obvious improvement to sound quality.\nTV Audio Swap for two\nBilly Steele for Engadget\nThe marquee feature for the Sonos Ace for the last year has been TV Audio Swap. This allows you to send the sound from a compatible Sonos soundbar to the headphones for an individual listening experience. Of course, this means you can watch an action flick at full volume after your family goes to bed or to tune in to a sporting event without annoying your partner. This has worked well for me both during my review and in the time since.\nUnfortunately, I don’t have a second pair of the Ace, so I can’t vouch for how well TV Audio Swap now works with a companion. But since the ability to send soundbar audio to two sets of Ace headphones is one of the main items in the recent software update, I can’t discuss the overall state of the device without mentioning this feature’s availability.\nImproved ANC and clearer calls\nAnother aspect of the Ace’s update is improved active noise cancellation (ANC), but not in the way you might expect. The company didn’t figure out a way to block more noise per se, but it does account for any sound leaks that may impact performance. Sonos says its refined ANC setup can adapt to changes in fit caused by hair, glasses and hats in real time using the sensors inside the Ace. With that tweak, I noticed the slightest difference in ANC performance when sunglasses or a hat kept the ear pads from sitting flush on my face, but it’s not quite as good as a tight seal. I’d characterize this update as a modest improvement, but it’s still an improvement nonetheless.\nSonos also claims that this software update offers an improved call experience thanks to higher resolution audio. The company also added Sidetone, or the ability for you to pipe in your voice during calls when ANC is enabled. Plenty of companies have this, to varying degrees, and the effectiveness depends on how natural the sound is and whether or not you’re able to make any adjustments. In the case of the Ace, Sidetone acts as an enhanced ambient mode, and it definitely improves the call experience. Since I could speak normally and didn’t feel the need to shout to hear myself, video and voice calls felt more natural.\nWrap-up\nA year after their debut, the Sonos Ace is living up to the lofty expectations the company set when the headphones arrived. After spending time with this batch of updates, I’m convinced the Ace would’ve benefitted from having all of this ready at launch, especially TrueCinema. Since one of the Ace’s main functions is personal living room listening, taking so long to deliver the feature that would boost sound quality this much is another misstep.\nOn the other hand, it’s good to see Sonos is still working to improve the Ace. When you consider the company spent most of 2024 fixing a majorly botched app redesign, it would have been understandable if Sonos left the Ace to languish until it was time for version 2.0. The company had to delay products last summer, and according to a report in March, it even canceled another entirely. When CEO Patrick Spence resigned in January, interim chief executive Tom Conrad expressed the need for “getting back to basics” (Conrad was named permanent CEO on July 23). Improving a major new product that was overshadowed by a poor run of form is certainly one way to reclaim some of your reputation. It also doesn’t hurt that the Ace is currently available for $149 less than its original $449 price.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/a-year-later-the-sonos-ace-is-finally-fulfilling-its-potential-170035355.html?src=rss",
    "full_text": "This has worked well for me both during my review and in the time since. Unfortunately, I don’t have a second pair of the Ace, so I can’t vouch for how well TV Audio Swap now works with a companion. The company didn’t figure out a way to block more noise per se, but it does account for any sound leaks that may impact performance. With that tweak, I noticed the slightest difference in ANC performance when sunglasses or a hat kept the ear pads from sitting flush on my face, but it’s not quite as good as a tight seal. Sonos also claims that this software update offers an improved call experience thanks to higher resolution audio. Plenty of companies have this, to varying degrees, and the effectiveness depends on how natural the sound is and whether or not you’re able to make any adjustments.

They’re here to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge. Critics have accused xAI of bypassing environmental safeguards and exposing residents to harmful emissions from gas-powered turbines with its Memphis data center. Tying back to other Trump themes of beating China, the strategy focuses on locking out foreign tech and emphasizing security protections to keep “adversarial technology” – like Chinese-made chips and hardware – out of the U.S. supply chain. One of the recommended policy actions is to update federal procurement guidelines to ensure the government only contracts with frontier large language model developers who “ensure their systems are objective and free from top-down ideological bias.” He added: “If the order instructs agencies to select AIs based on a combination of accuracy and neutrality, leaving each agency with some latitude to decide what that means, that might be more viable.” These resources are expensive, and typically were only possible for tech companies that could strike million or billion-dollar contracts with cloud providers. Under Trump’s plan, federal agencies will work together to collect intelligence on foreign frontier AI projects that could threaten American national security. These groups will also conduct assessments on the level of AI adoption among America’s adversaries."

Meta’s wristband employs a technique called surface electromyography (sEMG), which detects electrical signals generated by muscle activity to interpret user movements, as explained in a research paper published in the journal Nature. These signals can sense a person’s intended actions, even before they do them. The goal of this wristband is to provide less invasive tools to interact with computers for people with motor disabilities. The company is collaborating with Carnegie Mellon to test the wristband with people who have spinal cord injuries, enabling them to use computers even if they are unable to fully use their arms or hands. Douglas Weber, a professor in the Department of Mechanical Engineering and the Neuroscience Institute, noted that even people with complete hand paralysis still exhibit some muscle activity. As a result, the device is able to interpret their intended actions. The wristband is a simpler alternative to other projects, such as Elon Musk’s Neuralink, which aims to implant brain chips in individuals with severe paralysis. Other non-invasive approaches include headsets that utilize electroencephalogram (EEG) signals; however, these have limitations due to the weak signals they produce. Meanwhile, Meta’s wristband could be used immediately without surgical intervention, and its use of sEMG signals means it operates at a higher frequency than EEG."

For each desk, I timed how long it took to unpack and assemble, and I noted whether the manual was easy to follow. Any damage was noted, and images were sent to the manufacturers for review. For each desk, I checked the maximum load specification, and I tried to match that with the materials we actually use on our desks. Two 27-inch gaming monitors on a dual monitor arm"

    "summary": "My dream projector delivers the brightest and sharpest image. But it also has to be easy to move around and set up anywhere — especially outdoors. Anker’s Nebula X1 long-throw projector promises all of that with a three-laser engine that beams out a category-leading 3,500 ANSI lumens at 4K resolution. It also has features never seen before on a home projector, like liquid cooling to reduce fan noise and a motorized lens gimbal that automates setup. Plus, it offers good sound that can be upgraded with optional satellite speakers.\nThe rub is the price. At $3,000 ($3,298 with the satellite speakers for a limited time) it’s one of the more expensive consumer projectors, right up there with models like Epson’s LS11000 or the Valerion VisionMaster Pro2. After testing it, I can say that it offers the clearest, most vivid image quality I’ve seen and has the simplest setup to boot. However, the high price puts it far out of reach for most portable projector buyers. \n\n\nFeatures and design\nThe Nebula X1 follows in the footsteps of other Anker projectors, like the original Nebula and Cosmos, with a tall rectangular design and handle that neatly retracts with a press. While that makes it easy to carry, it also means the Nebula X1 hangs down more than most indoor projectors when ceiling-mounted.\nTo eliminate the tedious setup that typically plagues projectors, Anker did a clever thing: it placed the lens mechanism on a gimbal that can tilt up to 25 degrees. When combined with a 1.67x zoom, autofocus, keystone correction and ambient light detection, the projector fully automates setup. First, you have to choose a screen or wall location and position the projector at a prescribed distance between 8 and 35 feet, depending on the screen or wall size. You should center the projector as well as you can to avoid any digital (keystone) correction that can adversely affect image quality. Then the magic happens at the press of a button.\nThe Nebula X1 uses a function it calls Spatial Adaptation to scan the area in front of it. The lens tilts up and down, before displaying a checkerboard pattern and then beaming the final image pretty much precisely where it should be. It’s not perfect, as some obstacles like small plants or fine wires can throw it off, but it worked nicely for me on both a wall and dedicated screen. The projector can adapt to ambient light and even the wall color, and another function called Spatial Recall lets you save those settings for frequently used locations.\n\n\n\n  The Nebula X1's Spatial Adaptation feature in action.\n \n\n  Steve Dent for Engadget\n \n\nLaser engines get hot and are normally cooled with fans that can generate distracting noise. However, the Nebula X1 is the first consumer model with liquid cooling which reduces fan noise to a barely audible 26dB whisper. Thanks to this cooling system, the projector can also have a smaller footprint. That’s a big quality-of-life improvement compared to much of the competition.\nAs for inputs, the X1 comes with two HDMI 2.1 ports, including one with Enhanced Audio Return Channel (eARC) functionality. That standard supports fast refresh rates of up to 240Hz at 4K, though the X1 tops out at 4K 60Hz so it’s not ideal as a gaming projector. It also offers USB Type-A and USB Type-C ports, along with a S/PDIF optical audio port.\nGoogle TV is built in for streaming and projector control. It provides a large library of apps via Google Play along with a familiar interface. You also get Netflix’s official application with support for 4K Dolby Vision without the need to plug in a streaming device, plus Chromecast support and Google Assistant for voice control. The downside is that it can occasionally be sluggish, particularly with menu settings like projector image control.\nImage quality\n\n\n\n\n  Steve Dent for Engadget\n \n\nAnker uses what it calls “cinema-grade glass” in the Nebula’s 14-element lens to increase brightness, color accuracy and lens durability. The 4K triple laser engine is rated at up to 3,500 ANSI lumens with a 5,000:1 contrast ratio. At the same time, it offers color accuracy with a Delta E value of less than 0.8 and an impressive 110 percent of the Rec.2020 color spectrum, matching high-end ultra short throw (UST) models from Samsung, LG and Formovie. That 4K Dolby Vision support I mentioned is also rare among the competition.\nThe result is the sharpest and brightest image I’ve seen on any projector in this price range. It was bright enough for me to comfortably watch a soccer match on a sunny day without the shades lowered. And if you switch it to Conference mode, you can ramp the brightness up further for a viewable image even with lights on, but there’s the downside of a slight blue color cast.\nWhen used in a darkened room or outside at night, the Nebula’s image quality is the best of any projector I’ve tested. Even though it uses the same Texas Instruments 0.47-inch DMD (digital mirror device) as many other 4K models, the image is clearer and sharper thanks to the glass element lens. Contrast and black levels are also tops in this price range and not far off high-end projectors from JVC and Sony that cost twice as much. Once again, that’s due to the optics along with Anker’s 6-blade dynamic iris — another feature usually only found on high-end projectors — and the company’s “NebulaMaster 2.0” picture quality algorithm.\nColor accuracy is outstanding out of the box in both HDR and non-HDR modes thanks to the ISF (Image Science Foundation) certification normally reserved for more expensive projectors. In fact, I found the color calibration nearly perfect on my unit in “ISF Night” mode. That meant images were close to how they were calibrated by the filmmakers for TV series and movies like Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, Andor, Dune 2 and Spider-Man: No Way Home. If the colors aren’t quite to your liking, you can make fine adjustments manually. Like many other 4K projectors of this type, the X1 has a slight amount of light spill around the edge of the image. However, it’s well-controlled and only noticeable when the projected image is particularly dark.\nSound\n\n\n\n\n  Steve Dent for Engadget\n \n\nAnker put some extra work into the sound as well. Audio quality is solid thanks to the four built-in speakers with 40 watts total output. The lack of fan noise is a big help here. By itself, the X1 offers decent high-end and bass, but more importantly, dialog is easy to hear and understand.\nFor a big sonic upgrade, you can add a pair of Anker’s optional Nebula-branded satellite speakers that connect to the projector automatically via Wi-Fi. Each one has a pair of 40-watt front drivers, a 20-watt upward-firing driver and a 20-watt side-firing driver that combine to create a surround effect. Together with the projector, they deliver an impressive 200 watts of sound with Dolby Audio support (though not Dolby Atmos unfortunately). They’re also battery-powered with up to eight hours of use, which is especially handy for outdoor viewing. However, that also means you need to keep them charged.\nTo test these speakers, I selected several music-oriented movies including A Complete Unknown, Maestro and Rocketman, along with an action movie that has an impressive score and sound effects, Dune 2. In spite of their small size, the satellite speakers kept elements like music, dialog and sound effects crisp, clear and evenly balanced with powerful dynamic bass. You could certainly do better with a dedicated 5.1 or 7.1 surround sound system, but these speakers offer very respectable audio quality, are easy to set up and automatically sync with the picture. The X1 also supports other external Bluetooth speakers, but you may have to adjust the timing in the menus to ensure perfect sync for picture and sound.\nAnker also offers a $4,000 package that includes a pair of its Soundcore microphones along with the speakers. Those also connect to the X1 automatically and let you use it as a very expensive karaoke machine. They provide clear sound but you don’t get the usual benefits of a karaoke setup like AI vocal removal and vocal enhancement.\nWrap-up\n\n\n\n  The Nebula X1 offers a pair of HDMI 2.1 ports along with USB-C, USB-A and S/PIDF\n \n\n  Steve Dent for Engadget\n \n\nThe Nebula X1 is an odd proposition. It’s marketed as a portable outdoor projector, but it also happens to be the best indoor projector I’ve ever tested. With an impeccably sharp, high-contrast and color-accurate image, the video quality is irreproachable. The ease of setup and overall size also makes it an outstanding choice if you want to move the X1 around. With the optional satellite speakers, it’s the best portable projector you can get, hands down.\nThe Nebula X1 doesn’t have a lot of competition in the portable category, apart from Valerion’s $3,000 VisionMaster Pro 2, which also has a 4K triple laser engine. However, the X1 beats that model on image quality, portability and ease of setup.\nThe thing is, most people looking for a portable projector won’t spend more than $500, let alone $3,000. So who is this for? I think it’s ideal for buyers looking at a UST or high-end long-throw projector who want a bit more versatility. Some may even use it as a standalone indoor projector as it can be mounted on the ceiling or on a stand. In other words, if you have the means, use it any way you want — it’s that versatile.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/anker-nebula-x1-projector-review-the-king-of-outdoor-movies-if-you-can-afford-it-161519956.html?src=rss",

    "full_text": "is a news writer who covers the streaming wars, consumer tech, crypto, social media, and much more. Previously, she was a writer and editor at MUO. Google might replace the upcoming Pixel Pro Fold’s white and black models with two new color options. Leaked renders shared by Android Headlines show the Pixel 10 Pro Fold in a light green “Jade” and a silvery blue “Moonstone” — with no black or white option at all. Since the launch of Google’s first foldable in 2023, the company has sold the device and its Pixel 9 Pro Fold successor in either Obsidian (black) or Porcelain (white). The Pixel 10 Pro Fold could shake up these neutral tones for something a little more colorful, and I have to say that I’m liking the look of the pistachio green. Recent rumors suggest that the Pixel 10 Pro Fold will mainly offer just a spec bump, featuring a slightly larger 6.4-inch cover display, a bigger battery, and a new 1TB storage option. Android Headlines also previously reported that the Pixel 10 Pro Fold could be completely dustproof, which would be a first for foldable phones. Google will likely show off the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, along with the Pixel 10 that it already teased, during its Made by Google event on August 20th."

The intercepted messages “revealed numerous illicit activities related to cybercrime and ransomware,” and allowed investigators to identify at least $7 million in proceeds from cybercrime. The closed-access forum had more than 50,000 registered users and was a key marketplace for selling stolen data and hacking tools. The seized data will be used to support ongoing investigations, Europol said."

    "full_text": "The Wireless Power Consortium (WPC) has announced the official launch of faster Qi2 25W wireless charging, with the first devices already certified and “several hundred” yet to come. Most excitingly, it promises that alongside iPhone support, several “major Android smartphones” will finally be adopting the standard. Until now we’d only known the tech by its version number, Qi2.2, but the WPC has confirmed it will be known at Qi2 25W instead. The WPC has confirmed that iPhones will support Qi2 25W, though not which models. The iPhone 16 series currently offers 15W Qi2 charging speeds but 25W over MagSafe. Since the magnetic Qi2 standard is based in part on Apple’s MagSafe designs, it stands to reason that the 16 series might receive an update to the new standard, and presumably the upcoming iPhone 17 models will offer support too. To date only a single Android phone has fully supported Qi2, the HMD Skyline. A handful of Samsung’s flagships, including the recent Z Fold 7 and Z Flip 7, are certified “Qi2 Ready,” which means they support 15W Qi2 charging but don’t themselves include the magnetic ring needed for the full speeds, requiring owners to buy a magnetic Qi2 case for full functionality. We’ve asked the WPC for comment on whether the upcoming Android support will be full Qi2, or only Qi2 Ready. “Consumers will be delighted when they experience Qi2 25W as it delivers nearly 70% more power than the original Qi2."

The game was originally supposed to debut at $79.99 in October, but it’s now going back to the regular $69.99 Xbox game price. Microsoft announced earlier this year that it would be raising the price of new Xbox first-party games from $69.99 to $79.99, alongside increases to its consoles and controllers. The move to suddenly drop the price of The Outer Worlds 2 is a clear sign that preorders haven’t gone too well and that gamers are rejecting Microsoft’s initial move to $79.99 Xbox games. If you’ve already purchased the game then refunds will be handled by the Microsoft Store, Steam, PlayStation store or wherever you preordered The Outer Worlds 2. Other first-party Xbox games coming this holiday will also be sold at $69.99, instead of Microsoft’s new $79.99 pricing. “We’re focused on bringing players incredible worlds to explore, and will keep our full priced holiday releases, including The Outer Worlds 2, at $69.99 – in line with current market conditions,” says an unnamed Xbox spokesperson in a statement to IGN. It will be interesting to see whether Microsoft continues to push its new Xbox game pricing in the new year, or whether this is a sign that it’s fully rethinking the increase to $79.99.

According to market research firm Circana, Nintendo’s new console “debuted as the fastest selling video game hardware device in US history,” selling 1.6 million units in June. That topped the previous launch month record held by the PS4, which moved 1.1 million units in November of 2023. Unsurprisingly, Circana says that the Switch 2 was the best-selling console in the US in June overall, in terms of both units sold and dollars raked in. And overall the launch buoyed what the firm says is “a record high for hardware spending” in the month of June at $978 million. The previous record was $608 million in 2008. As for games, it should come as no surprise that most Switch 2 owners also picked up a copy of Mario Kart World, which was the only major first-party exclusive for the console until Donkey Kong Bananza launched earlier this month. According to Circana, a whopping 82 percent of those who bought a Switch 2 also got a copy of World, either via a console bundle or buying a physical copy of the game. And in terms of accessories, the Switch 2 Pro Controller had a 32 percent attach rate, according to the research firm."

T-Satellite has been in beta testing since December 2024, with nearly 1.8 million users signing up so far. The direct-to-cell messaging service represents a major step forward in mobile technology: It works with most phones made during the last four years, according to T-Mobile, instead of requiring dedicated hardware. The company said 911 texting will be available later this year to \"any mobile customer with a compatible device, regardless of carrier or whether or not they are subscribed to the service.\" Satellite connectivity in cellphones isn’t exactly new -- iPhones have had it since 2022 -- but it’s typically been reserved for SOS messaging to connect you with an emergency dispatcher. Android users will also get MMS immediately, with iPhone support “to follow.” T-Satellite is available to AT&T, T-Mobile and Verizon customers for a standalone $10 per month. Even if you don’t pay the $10 a month, T-Mobile says 911 texting will be available later this year “to any mobile customer with a compatible device, regardless of carrier.” If you’re a Verizon or AT&T customer, you’ll have to activate T-Satellite as a second eSIM on your phone to take advantage of the service.

The wireless bars on my phone finally abandoned me at Lake Diablo, about two and a half hours northeast of Seattle, giving me a chance to bounce messages back and forth from space to test whether T-Mobile has made satellite texting as easy as everyday cellular texting. The only difference over satellite is that it took around two and a half minutes to send. T-Mobile has cited AllTrails as an example of apps that'll be compatible with the service. But at one point after sending a message, some text below it said the app was waiting to connect. I also ran into some confusion with my iPhone 16 Pro running T-Satellite as a secondary eSIM. On further research, I discovered that an active third-party satellite connection shows \"SAT\" in the menu bar. Will satellite services cover the remaining dead zones and allow easy communication even in remote areas? As companies build up the capacity and performance of satellite services, it's easy to see a near future where you don't have to think about how you're getting data, just as we currently don't ever think about which cellular tower is relaying our data. As someone who lives in cellular-saturated Seattle, I probably won't need to rely on satellite data."

As for what the new season will include, we have the above trailer for reference -- which starts sort of like a horror movie trailer before unleashing fires, dismantling the Statue of Liberty and disastrous plane collisions. If you want to watch the 27th season of the show co-created by Trey Parker and Matt Stone, here's what to know. That's the current date after it was delayed from July 9.

And like with its best known service, Proton Mail, the company says Lumo is for those who want a private alternative to what big tech is offering.\nProton says every conversation with Lumo is secured with zero-access encryption, meaning only your device can unlock your content. In the context of an AI chatbot, that has several implications. Most notably, it means not even Proton can view your chats. As a result, the company can't share your data with governments, advertisers or, for that matter, any other company, and it can't use your data to train future AI models. \"By using Lumo, you can enjoy the benefits of an advanced AI assistant without the risk of your data being misused,\" says Proton.\nI briefly tried Lumo. It's a bit slow to generate a response, but you can broadly expect a similar experience to what you would find using ChatGPT or Claude for free. Lumo can search the web to answer questions beyond its knowledge cut-off date, but by default that feature is turned off to further protect user privacy. You can also upload files to Lumo. Here again Proton says the chatbot won't save any information.\nProton isn't touting the performance of Lumo's large language models, but if you're curious about this sort of thing, it's powered by a handful of open-source systems, including Mistral NeMo and Mistral Small 3, among others. Proton told The Verge Lumo will filter requests through the model best suited for the task. For example, it will use NVIDIA's OpenHands system for coding requests.\nLumo is free to use, with a weekly query limit. You don't need a Proton account to begin a conversation with the chatbot. In addition to being available on the web, Proton offers both Android and iOS apps. A $13 per month Plus plan offers unlimited usage, alongside perks like larger uploads, access to more advanced AI models, priority support and more.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/protons-privacy-focused-lumo-chatbot-encrypts-all-your-conversations-144551345.html?src=rss",

Pricing goes up on its monthly and annual plans beginning July 23, and will increase in August for current subscribers. With a bump of $3 more each month for Peacock Premium and Peacock Premium Plus, the rates are going from $8 to $11 for the ad-based option, and from $14 to $17 for the ad-free version. For the yearly plan, the price is up from $80 a year to $110 for Premium, and Premium Plus is $170 instead of $140. Existing customers will see the change in their bills on or after Aug. 22. Though Peacock raised its prices last year, these new rates put it on par with HBO Max and other rivals like Disney Plus, whose bundle offerings can help save money. The streamer said that it's testing a new tier called Select, -- which is now available on the site -- a cheaper offering with current programming from NBC and Bravo, along with a slate of library titles. Because it's positioned as Peacock's lowest-priced option at $8 per month ($80 a year), you'll have the choice to upgrade to either Premium or Premium Plus. Later this year, viewers will be able to stream NBA on NBC, Wicked: For Good, Jurassic World Rebirth and the Love Island reunion. And in 2026, cord-cutters can watch Super Bowl LX on Peacock."

    "summary": "Apple has introduced a new tier of its AppleCare insurance policy called AppleCare One. This allows you to cover up to three of your Apple products under a single plan for $20 per month. If you want to add extra devices beyond that, you can do so for an additional $6 per month, per product.\nApple first introduced AppleCare+ in 2011 as a means of insuring your iPhone against accidental damage, and has since expanded the plan to its entire product line, adding coverage for theft and loss. Currently, AppleCare+ costs from $10 per month to insure an individual iPhone, with subscription prices starting at $3.49 per month for a Mac, and $5 for an iPad, depending on the model you own. You can also insure your Apple Watch, Vision Pro headset, AirPods, Apple TV and HomePod either individually, or as part of your new AppleCare One plan.\nAppleCare One features all the same benefits as AppleCare+, including unlimited repairs for accidents such as drops and spills, round-the-clock support from Apple experts, servicing and battery coverage. The theft and loss protection that was previously exclusive to iPhone plans now also covers iPad and Apple Watch if they’re included in your AppleCare One plan. You can make up to three claims a year for theft or loss of an iPhone, iPad or Apple Watch.\nThe $20 monthly price is fixed regardless of which products you include (as is the $6 you pay to add an additional device), meaning the amount you actually save will depend on what they would cost to insure individually, so it’s worth looking into that before you take out the new plan. Apple says that people who cover their iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch could save as much as $11 per month on AppleCare One compared to what they’d pay if each device was insured under AppleCare+.\nAlso new with AppleCare One is the ability to add devices you already own to a protection plan. Previously you’d have to decide within 60 days of purchasing an Apple device. Apple says that providing they’re under four years old, are in good condition when added and are in your Apple account, they can be covered under AppleCare One. You may need to run a diagnostic check either on the device itself or at an Apple Store to get it approved.\nAppleCare One also simplifies the trade-in process. If you trade in a product covered by your plan directly to Apple, it is automatically taken out and replaced by the new device. Unlike AppleCare+, though, there doesn’t appear to be a way to pay annually for your plan. Instead, it rolls monthly for as long as you need it, and Apple will let you move products in and out of coverage whenever you want.\nAppleCare One launches tomorrow in the US, and can be activated either on your iPhone, Mac or iPad, or in an Apple Store.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/applecare-one-lets-you-protect-three-devices-under-one-subscription-135559271.html?src=rss",

Several other government departments and agencies were also compromised in an early wave of attacks exploiting the SharePoint bug, researchers confirmed. The vulnerability is known as a zero-day because Microsoft had no time to release patches before it was exploited. Microsoft has since released patches for all affected SharePoint versions.

    "full_text": "The Switch 2 Pro controller is the best controller Nintendo has ever made – and that’s saying something. It’s incredibly comfortable to hold, its joysticks are buttery smooth, and all of its buttons are wonderfully responsive. Nintendo even made it customizable this time with rear buttons that can easily be mapped inside of any game. The Switch 2 Pro Controller costs $85, which seems a bit egregious when you can get an excellent controller like 8BitDo’s Ultimate 2 wireless gamepad for $60. As good as the competition is, though, you won’t find anything that can be easily configured directly from within the Switch 2’s user interface. My hands often feel cramped when I play that game with the Switch 2’s Joy-Con 2 controllers for too long. But there’s none of that with the Switch 2 Pro controller. I was able to race for an hour without any discomfort, and I also noticed that it was easier for me to pull off the game’s tricky jump maneuvers and rail sliding. The Switch 2 Pro controller is also seriously helpful with fighting games, thanks to its smooth and accurate directional pad. It acquits itself to most genres easily, though it would have been nice to see analog triggers for more precise control in serious racing games."

    "full_text": "Nintendo's already delivered a killer one-two punch with Mario Kart World and Donkey Kong Bananza for Switch 2 but the upgrade for Jamboree, while charming at times, doesn't exactly live up to expectations. An upgraded Mario Party game board and minigame browser have new games that use the Joy-Con 2 mouse mode in some fun ways. Mouse mode can be rewarding with air hockey where you slam your puck around, or as a way to slide fast and click on parts of the screen. The only thing is, a lot of these new modes in mouse mode feel like they could also have been done with motion controls, which the Joy-Cons are also capable of. Should you have one, there are some fun motion-based games that have you moving your body with camera-based tracking, similar to older camera-connected games from the Xbox Kinect/PlayStation Eye era. It's fun, silly and doesn't actually require you to use yourself. One involves jumping to hit a coin block, something I did for real in Epic Universe at Super Nintendo World. You can play Mario Party's new modes without a camera, too. The camera mode doesn't automatically track your body wherever you go. My son preferred playing regular Mario Party modes where we weren't trying to fit ourselves onscreen."

    "full_text": "Killer Inn is an upcoming murder mystery that pits 24 players against each other in a game of deception. Lambs are left clueless of who is friend or foe and must be cautious when encountering another player. These keys can then be traded into various glowing chests around the map to unlock random items. It's still early for Killer Inn but I didn't find any of these quests to be particularly engaging. This is a great feature because it allows you to hold secret conversations away from others. Voice chat with random public people on the internet can be a crapshoot so your mileage may vary. There are also single-use items in the game that can help each side hide or find more when searching a body. There are six anchors locking the ship in place and they must slowly lift each one before winning. In my previews this is where the largest gun fights broke out because each team was making a last-ditch effort to win. In fact, most of the murders I came across were pretty standard stabbings or shootings."

This means you should be able to run Bitdefender without issue while performing high-resource activities like playing video games or editing videos. Next, I analyzed Bitdefender’s third-party lab test results to determine how well it protects your devices from malware. This policy states that Bitdefender will generally only share your information with data processors for the purposes of providing improved customer support and personalized email marketing. Bitdefender has additional security protocols for parental control data, ensuring that only you can access information about your children’s device usage. All of these protocols have proven effective, as Bitdefender hasn’t experienced a known security breach in well over five years. I tested most of these communication methods (excluding the community expert forum) to see how fast and helpful Bitdefender’s support team is. Bitdefender’s knowledge base is laid out well, with a search bar at the top and buttons to access various types of tutorials."

The company says the chatbot keeps no logs of your conversations, has end-to-end encryption for storing chats, and offers a ghost mode for conversations that disappear as soon as you close the window. Available via a web client, as well as Android and iOS apps, Lumo doesn’t require you to have an account to use the chatbot and ask questions. You can upload files to have the chatbot answer questions about them, and if you have a Proton Drive account, you can connect it with Lumo to access files stored in the cloud. The company says Lumo is based on open source models, and it will only depend on them for research and development going forward without utilizing user data to train its models. Throughout its blog post about Lumo, Proton emphasized its European base, saying it gives the company a leg up over AI companies based in the U.S. and China when it comes to privacy. “Lumo is based upon open-source language models and operates from Proton’s European datacenters. This gives you much greater transparency into the way Lumo works than any other major AI assistant. Unlike Apple Intelligence and others, Lumo is not a partnership with OpenAI or other American or Chinese AI companies, and your queries are never sent to any third parties,” Proton said. This is not Proton’s first foray into the fast-developing AI tools space: Last year, it rolled out an AI-powered writing assistant for its Mail product that also runs on the user’s device."

The series follows sex columnist Carrie Bradshaw (Sarah Jessica Parker) and her friends in New York City. In season two, the drama heads to Seoul when Hendricks finds himself working on a mission with Korean intelligence. Ted Danson stars as Charles, a lonely widower whose wife died the year before after suffering from Alzheimer's. Andrew Scott plays the cunning Tom Ripley, a stylish con man who uses morally sketchy methods to get what he wants -- even murder. It follows high school chemistry teacher Walter White, who turns to cooking meth when he's diagnosed with cancer and worries about providing for his family.

In past years, Republicans investigated social media companies for allegedly altering their algorithms to censor conservative voices. A key question looming around this executive order is who defines whether AI models are neutral or biased, and how they determine it. These companies are in the awkward position to generate AI responses that please everyone, while also not spreading extremist viewpoints or misinformation. Many of America’s leading AI model developers asked Trump to use his AI Action plan to guarantee that training large language models on copyrighted material would be fair use, and should therefore be allowed. By releasing its Llama models openly, Meta has been able to undercut OpenAI and Google’s closed offerings."

To verify that a device is in “good condition,” it may be required to undergo a diagnostic check using a customer’s iPhone or iPad, or at an Apple Store, before being added to the plan.

    "full_text": "AppleCare One, which won't link with the similarly named Apple One subscription service plan, will cover up to three Apple devices for $20 a month. This includes any device Apple currently sells that's AppleCare eligible, and they can either be added during the first 60 days after a purchase or anytime up to four years after their purchase if they remain in \"good condition.\" Broadly, this means they must turn on and don't have a cracked screen. Additional devices can be added to AppleCare One for $6 each. But in instances where a customer wouldn't benefit from AppleCare One, such as covering just an Apple Watch and AirPods, Apple will instead direct the customer toward those original Plus plans. This may mean that new AppleCare Plus subscribers will have to pay slightly more, even if they weren't looking for theft and loss protection. Anyone who currently has an AppleCare plan that doesn't include theft and loss coverage can continue those terms until they conclude their subscription. Therefore, a theoretical iPhone 17 would quickly get added to an AppleCare One plan after being purchased, and automatically replace an iPhone 13 that's traded in. AppleCare One will likely be best for a single user who needs coverage for multiple Apple products, but the bundle service won't work across an entire family of Apple accounts. That might prove to be a slight point of confusion -- for instance, my Apple TV Plus account automatically shares with my parents and brother -- and families looking to cover multiple iPhones will either need to pay for each AppleCare Plus plan separately or consider phone insurance alternatives for comparable coverage."

President Donald Trump has said Apple will have to pay a 25% tariff on iPhones made outside the US. A Bloomberg report from March supports those rumors and notes that the iPhone Air could measure 5.5mm thick. According to Kuo and Bloomberg, it's possible this version of the iPhone 17 would have only one main camera, doing without the ultrawide and 5x telephoto lenses that have been staples of Apple's premium iPhones for years. This can help conserve battery by automatically adjusting your iPhone's performance based on how you're using it at the moment, according to Apple. Adaptive Power could therefore be especially helpful with making the iPhone 17 Air's battery last longer. If the iPhone 17 Air takes off, that thinner form factor could shape Apple's other future devices. In January, a leaked image from Majin Bu on X suggested the phone could feature a pill-shaped camera bar, essentially resembling what you'd find on Google's Pixel 9 phone. Rumors on what frames the iPhone 17 lineup will feature have gone back and forth. Kuo noted the iPhone 17 Air and Pro models would sport that increased 12GB of RAM, but that Apple was still deciding whether to equip the baseline model with 8GB or 12GB of RAM."

    "full_text": "What if you could download Netflix’s entire library in under a second? How about every English language page on Wikipedia (including all revisions) five times over? That’s the dream scientists at Japan’s National Institute of Information and Communications Technology have made a reality, achieving a world record in data transmission speed of 1.02 Petabits per second over 1,123 miles -- roughly the distance between Miami and Cleveland. It might seem like a novelty record akin to hooking up 444 gaming consoles to one TV, but the breakthrough speeds have legitimate real-world implications. That’s because the researchers used fiber-optic cables compatible with existing infrastructure. For the test, they used a 19-core optical fiber with a standard cladding diameter of 0.125mm -- the same thickness currently used in networks worldwide. This 19-core optical fiber can use 19 different light paths to transmit data in the same space usually taken up by one. That’s how you can get such a massive increase in capacity without entirely overhauling the 870,000 miles of undersea cables that run the internet. A well-known rule in the networking world called Nielsen’s law states that a high-end internet user’s connection speed grows by roughly 50% each year, doubling every 21 months -- an observation that has held true since 1983. I’d say a high-end internet user has one-gig speeds right now; in a decade, it’s not hard to imagine that being 10Gbps."

While children under 13 years of age aren't allowed to sign up on the social media app, Meta allows adults like parents and managers to run accounts for children and post videos and photos of them. The company says that these accounts are \"overwhelmingly used in benign ways,\" but they're also targeted by predators who leave sexual comments and ask for sexual images in DMs. \nIn the coming months, the company is giving these adult-ran kid accounts its strictest message settings to prevent unsavory DMs. It will also automatically turn on Hidden Words for them so that account owners can filter out unwanted comments on their posts. In addition, Meta will avoid recommending them to accounts blocked by teen users to lessen the chances predators finding them.

It also deleted an additional, 500,000 Facebook and Instagram accounts linked to those original ones.\nMeta introduced teen accounts on Instagram last year to automatically opt users 13 to 18 years of age into stricter privacy features. The company then launched teen accounts on Facebook and Messenger in April and is even testing AI age-detection tech to determine whether a supposed adult user has lied about their birthday so they could be moved to a teen account if needed. \nSince then, Meta has rolled out more and more safety features meant for younger teens. It released Location Notice in June to let younger teens know that they're chatting with someone from another country, since sextortion scammers typically lie about their location. (To note, authorities have observed a huge increase in \"sextortion\" cases involving kids being threatened online to send explicit images.) Meta also introduced a nudity protection feature, which blurs images in DM detected as containing nudity, since sextortion scammers may send nude pictures first in an effort to convince a victim to send reciprocate. \nToday, Meta is also launching new ways for teens to view safety tips.

    "summary": "Whether you're backing up important files, editing videos on the go or just freeing up space on your laptop, a fast and reliable SSD drive can make your workflow a whole lot smoother. The best portable SSD options in 2025 combine speed, durability and wide compatibility, often using USB Type-C connections for quick transfers across devices. Unlike a traditional thumb drive or even the best external hard drives, these compact powerhouses can offer faster read speeds, often hitting several hundred or even thousands of Mbps, especially with high-performance NVMe SSD models.Whether you're managing large files or launching apps directly from your drive, we've rounded up the best SSDs that deliver excellent performance without weighing you down.\nTable of contents\n\nBest external SSDs for 2025\nOther external SSDs we tested\nWhat to consider before buying an external SSD\nHow we test external SSDs\nRecent updates\n\nBest external SSDs for 2025\n \n \n \nOther external SSDs we tested\nThe pre-built OWC Express 1M2 is a premium-feeling USB4 SSD that’s roughly as fast as the ADATA SE920, but it’s larger and significantly more expensive as of this writing. \nIf you’re in the relatively small group with a PC that supports USB 3.2 Gen 2x2 but not Thunderbolt or USB4, the Crucial X10 Pro is essentially a faster version of our top pick. The Lexar SL600 is a larger but slightly quicker option, while the Lexar SL500, Kingston XS2000 or Samsung T9 could also work if you see them on discount. As a reminder, though, drives like these are aimed primarily at content creators and other professionals, and you have to make sure you won’t upgrade to a device with a faster USB interface anytime soon.\nThe Samsung T7 Shield has a conveniently rugged design with a rubberized, IP65-rated shell. It also comes with both USB-C and USB-A cables. But it was consistently slower than the X9 Pro and XS1000 in our benchmark tests, plus it has a shorter three-year warranty.\nThe Silicon Power PX10 is an especially affordable USB 3.2 Gen 2 model. Its peak speeds weren’t too far off the X9 Pro or XS1000 in synthetic benchmarks, but it can get distractingly hot and its sustained writes are markedly worse. It took 50 seconds longer to move our 70GB custom test folder to this drive compared to the X9 Pro, for example.\nThe Crucial X6 is another low-cost option that’s a good bit slower than our top picks. It’s limited to a three-year warranty and lacks an IP rating as well. It’s not a terrible option for the basics, but there’s little reason to get it over the XS1000 when their prices are similar.\nThe OWC Envoy Pro FX is well-built and supports Thunderbolt 3 and USB 3.2 Gen 2, but it’s a smidge slower than the SE920 and Express 1M2, and it’s much pricier than the former.\n\n\n\n   The Samsung T9 portable SSD. \n \n\n   Samsung \n \n\nWhat to consider before buying an external SSD\nCapacity\nThe first thing to figure out before buying a portable SSD is just how much storage space you need. Most of the SSD drives we considered for this guide are available in capacities ranging from one to four terabytes, though plenty of smaller and larger options exist.\nThere’s no hard-and-fast rule for which size is “best” — that’ll ultimately depend on your budget and what exactly you’re looking to stash. But in general, it’s better to overcompensate than underdo it. Nobody wants to be forced into buying a second drive because they filled the first one up too quickly. If you’re backing up a PC, a good rule of thumb is to buy an external SSD with twice as much space as your computer’s internal storage. This way, you can save at least one full backup while also having room for additional data. If you want to store a bunch of PlayStation or Xbox games with huge install sizes, you may need more space. If you just want to back up a small collection of files, you may be better off saving your cash and just getting a smaller USB flash drive or thumb drive instead, which aren’t quite the same as the best portable SSDs we tested for this guide.\nPrice\nIn general, you get a better price-per-gigabyte ratio the further you go up the capacity ladder. As of this writing, the 1TB Samsung T9 is priced at $130, or $0.13 per gigabyte (GB), while the 4TB version is available for $297 or $0.07 per GB. That technically makes the larger model a better “value,” but not everyone needs to pay that much more upfront.\nSSDs in the same speed class tend to not vary too wildly in terms of performance, so part of our decision-making for this guide came down to which ones are often the cheapest. But prices can fluctuate over time; if you see that one of our top picks is priced way higher than a comparable honorable mention, feel free to get the latter. At this point in time, costs are broadly trending upwards for even the best SSDs.\n\n\n\n   The ADATA SE920 portable SSD connected to an Apple MacBook Pro. \n \n\n   Photo by Jeff Dunn / Engadget \n \n\nSpeed and USB interface\nJust about all external SSDs are significantly faster than mechanical hard disk drives (HDDs), so you’ll save time waiting for files to transfer and games to load no matter what. Within the market, however, there are distinct performance tiers. These are defined in large part by the USB interface a drive supports. While all of the SSDs we considered for this guide can connect over USB Type-C, some USB-C connections can supply faster transfer speeds than others. Sorting through this can get real confusing real fast, so we’ll try to put it in simple terms.\nYou can essentially divide today’s crop of portable SSDs into different segments. At the very top are drives that utilize the (relatively) new Thunderbolt 5 standard, which has a theoretical maximum transfer rate of 80 gigabits per second (Gbps). (You may see it advertise speeds up to 120 Gbps, but that boost doesn’t apply to storage devices.) But portable SSDs that support this tech only just started to trickle out toward the end of 2024, and the market for devices with Thunderbolt 5 ports is still fairly limited, with the most notable exceptions being Apple’s top-end Macs with an M4 Pro or M4 Max chip.\nThunderbolt 5 is built on a spec called USB4, which can technically reach up to 80 Gbps as well but is more typically available in a flavor that tops out at 40 Gbps. Portable SSDs based on that standard started to roll out toward the end of 2023 but are still relatively infrequent. The older Thunderbolt 3 and Thunderbolt 4, which other high-end external SSDs continue to use, support the same 40 Gbps maximum.\nA third version of USB4, meanwhile, maxes at 20 Gbps, as does an older yet more frequently used standard called USB 3.2 Gen 2x2. Below that is USB 3.2 Gen 2, which maxes at 10 Gbps. Then there’s USB 3.2 Gen 1, which is capped at 5 Gbps. Lastly, we’ll bundle together SSDs that use older standards and aren’t worth considering here.\nTo make this easy: For everyday folks, a good USB 3.2 Gen 2 drive is the sweet spot between fast-enough performance, wide-enough compatibility and cheap-enough price, so those make up our primary recommendations above. If you work in a creative field or don’t mind paying extra to shave seconds off your large file transfers, though, a “higher-tier” model would make sense. However, note that actual computers that utilize USB 3.2 Gen 2x2 aren’t super common — no Mac supports it, for one — and the interface is effectively being replaced by USB4.\nIn general, your chain is only as strong as its weakest link: If your computer only has USB 3.2 Gen 2 ports, for example, you could still use a Thunderbolt SSD, but you won’t get beyond Gen 2 speeds. Make sure you know what you’re working with before you buy.\nAs a refresher, storage devices are broadly measured in terms of read speeds and write speeds. The former refers to how long it takes to access something from the drive; the latter, how long it takes to save something to it. From there, you can break these metrics into sequential and random performance. Sequential speeds tend to matter more with portable SSDs, since most people use them to save or access long, constant streams of data such as a bunch of high-res photos. Random speeds would be important if you want to run video games or apps off the drive, since that’d involve reading and writing smaller, more scattered files. Either way, how well an SSD can sustain its performance with extended use is also critical.\nOther performance factors and enclosures\nA modern portable SSD’s speeds aren’t just about its USB interface, though. Its performance can also depend on how advanced its controller is, whether it has a native USB flash controller or a separate bridge chip to communicate with a host device, the kind and quality of NAND flash memory it uses, whether it has a DRAM cache or it’s DRAM-less, and more.\nWe’re simplifying things, but here are some quick tips: Drives with triple-level cell (TLC) memory aren’t as cheap as quad-level cell (QLC) SSDs, but they’re generally more reliable and they offer better write performance. Having a dedicated DRAM cache helps if you plan to hit your drive with more intense, sustained workloads, but may not be worth the extra cost for most people. Some models with native flash controllers may not perform as well as those with a bridging chip, depending on the SSD inside, but they typically draw less heat and are physically smaller. All of this is to say that an external SSD’s speeds aren’t quite as straightforward as what the manufacturer chooses to advertise on the box.\nIt’s also worth remembering that you can turn an internal SSD into a portable solution with a good enclosure. If you have a spare drive and don’t mind going the DIY route, this can be a cheaper and more flexible solution, though we’ve stuck to pre-built models for this guide for the sake of simplicity.\n\n\n\n\n   Photo by Jeff Dunn / Engadget \n \n\nSize, durability, endurance and warranty\nMost portable SSDs are impressively small and light, so they won’t be difficult to tuck in a bag (or even a pocket) and take on the go. We note above if any drive is bulkier than usual.\nNothing we’re talking about matters if your drive can’t last in the long term. It’s hard to definitively say which external SSDs are the most reliable, but we scoured through user reviews and feedback while researching this guide to ensure none of our picks show a pattern of catastrophic errors. If there was too much smoke around a particular model, we steered clear. We ruled out certain drives from SanDisk and Western Digital, for instance, after reports from Ars Technica and The Verge noted an issue that led to data loss (and lawsuits) in 2023.\nThat said, one of the big reasons you’d buy an SSD in general is its superior durability. Because it has no moving mechanical parts inside, an SSD has far fewer avenues to failure than an external hard drive. You still don’t want to be careless with them, but an accidental drop shouldn’t be the end of the world.\nSome portable SSDs build on this inherent ruggedness with plastic or rubberized casings and more robust waterproofing. These aren’t necessary for everyone, but if you’re a frequent traveler or someone who often works outdoors, there are options for you.\nStill, all drives can fail. If you have any sort of data you’d be distraught to lose, you should back it up regularly, then make a second backup, ideally with a cloud service. Along those protective lines, we also took note of the warranty policy for each drive we tested. Just about all of them are backed for either three or five years; of course, longer is better.\nEncryption and software\nIt’s not uncommon to store sensitive data on a portable SSD, so some models offer extra security features like hardware-based encryption — i.e., direct scrambling of data stored on the drive itself — built-in keypads and fingerprint readers to protect against unauthorized access if the drive is lost or stolen. While not top requirements, perks like these are certainly good to have. Some SSDs also come with companion software to further manage the drive. The best of those can be handy to have around, but we wouldn’t call them essential.\nHow we test external SSDs\nUnfortunately, we did not have access to a device that can make full use of USB 3.2 Gen 2, USB 3.2 Gen 2x2 and Thunderbolt/USB4 speeds interchangeably, so we had to split our testing across multiple devices, including an M1 Pro MacBook Pro and an Alienware gaming PC running Windows 11. Because of this, we primarily compared the portable SSDs within each “class” against one another. Before switching OSes, we reformatted each drive to each platform’s standard file system format: APFS for macOS and NTFS for Windows.\nAfter researching which SSDs had enough positive feedback to be worth testing in the first place, we put 13 drives through a range of synthetic and “real-world” benchmark tests. On Windows, these included CrystalDiskMark, PCMark 10’s Data Drive Benchmark and 3DMark’s gaming-focused Storage Benchmark. On macOS, we used AmorphousDiskMark (effectively a Mac version of CrystalDiskMark), BlackMagic Disk Speed Test and ATTO Disk Benchmark.\nWe also timed how long it took for each drive to read and write a custom 70GB folder filled with roughly 11,500 different files, including photos, videos, music files, PDFs and other large and small data types scattered across numerous subfolders. We performed multiple passes for each test to avoid irregularities, and we kept track of each SSD’s heat levels over the course of the whole suite. Our process wasn't a perfect science, but it gave us a general sense of how each drive compares to other models in its price and performance range.\nRecent updates\nFebruary 2025: We’ve checked to ensure the pricing info and links in this guide are still accurate. We’ve also added details on the (relatively) new Thunderbolt 5 interface, which has been implemented in a couple recent portable SSDs like the OWC Envoy Ultra and LaCie Rugged SSD Pro5. We’ll look to include testing notes for those for our next update, as they should be faster than the ADATA SE920, our current premium pick, albeit for a much higher price. For now, though, our top picks remain the same.\nOctober 2024: We’ve taken a sweep through this guide to ensure all pricing and availability info is still correct. Our recommendations are unchanged.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-portable-ssd-120043652.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Welcome to Video Games Weekly on Engadget. Expect a new story every Monday or Tuesday, broken into two parts. The first is a space for short essays and ramblings about video game trends and related topics from me, Jess Conditt, a reporter who's covered the industry for more than 13 years. The second contains the video game stories from the past week that you need to know about, including some headlines from outside of Engadget.\nPlease enjoy — and I'll see you next week.\n\nThis week, I’m fried. Maybe it’s the plodding and ever-present crumbling of society and human decency, or maybe it’s because Love Island USA just ended so I’m feeling extra listless. It’s a familiar summer sensation, but this year everything is exaggerated and extra tense, the stakes of every action seem higher, and instead of melting into the warmth of the season with a popsicle and a smile, I often find myself frozen and numb. I am the popsicle, coo coo ca choo.\nI’m not sure exactly what I’m trying to convey here, but I think it’s clear that I shouldn’t be writing anything too serious at the moment. I’m working on a few reports and trying to keep my composure amid the chaos, and all the while, the video game headlines keep rolling on. I’ve included a few more than usual this week, as penance for my popsicle state.\n\nThe news\nThe Chinese Room escapes from Tencent\nUK studio The Chinese Room, creator of Still Wakes the Deep and Everybody’s Gone to the Rapture, is independent once again. The Chinese Room leaders completed a management buyout with help from VC firm Hiro Capital to fully split the studio from Tencent subsidiary Sumo Digital, which acquired it in 2018. A number of people were laid off as part of the transition and the studio is left with a total of 55 employees. The Chinese Room is still working on Vampire: The Masquerade — Bloodlines 2 for Paradox Interactive, and it also has original projects in development.\nStill Wakes the Deep was one of my absolute favorite games of 2024. Whether you’re a fan of beautiful paranormal horror or you're just really into oil rigs, give it a go.\nRead these stories that Vice censored\nVice’s owner, Savage Ventures, doesn’t want you to read this story. Or this one.\nVice removed two articles about Steam’s new ban on certain “adult-only” content and the organization that pushed for the change, Collective Shout, which has the support of prominent anti-pornography groups with conservative religious foundations. The stories were written by contributor Ana Valens, who said the removals were “due to concerns about the controversial subject matter — not journalistic complaints.” Valens has vowed to never write for Vice again and a handful of reporters there have resigned in solidarity.\nCensoring stories about censorship is certainly a choice, Vice.\nSupermassive delays Directive 8020 and shrinks its team\nThe home of Until Dawn and The Dark Pictures Anthology, Supermassive Games, is laying off 36 people, restructuring its team and delaying one of its projects into 2026. A statement from the studio says the decisions were in response to the video game industry’s “challenging and ever-evolving environment.” It’s estimated that Supermassive had more than 300 employees before the layoffs.\nDirective 8020, the fifth installment in the Dark Pictures Anthology, is now due to come out in the first half of 2026, rather than this fall. Honestly, I’m not surprised to hear Supermassive needs more time to work on Directive 8020. I watched Engadget UK bureau chief Mat Smith play the demo at Summer Game Fest in June, and while it looked great, we were both surprised by how short and non-interactive the segment was. He summed up this feeling in his preview with the line, “Finally, I got to play (but only for a few minutes).”\nSupermassive is also working on Little Nightmares III, a series that it took over from Tarsier Studios. Tarsier created Little Nightmares and its sequel, but lost the rights to the IP when the team was acquired by a subsidiary of Embracer Group in 2019. Series publisher Bandai Namco kept the Little Nightmares brand and commissioned Supermassive to build the third game, while Tarsier is working on its own project, Reanimal.\nIt makes sense that Supermassive would prioritize Little Nightmares III in order to fulfill its obligations with Bandai. The game has already been delayed once, and it’s set to hit PC and consoles on October 10.\nFBC: Firebreak is getting less busted\nI still have high hopes for FBC: Firebreak to be the Left 4 Dead revival we’ve always wanted, but fact is, it’s not quite there yet. Remedy Entertainment is aware of this hard truth and has a plan to fix it. The studio laid out its pipeline for making FBC: Firebreak easier to jump into, more fun to play and less confusing overall, with most major changes coming in an update this winter.\nValve is still the best retirement community in game development\nPCGamesN published an interview with Counter-Strike co-creator Minh Le, who left Valve years ago to try out independent development. One sentiment stuck out to me.\n“They didn't force me out or anything,” Le told PCGamesN. “But a part of me kind of regrets it. Looking back, my decision to leave Valve was, financially, kind of a poor decision. If I had stayed with Valve, I would have been able to retire by now.”\nIt’s not presented as an indictment of Valve, but I find it notable that Le describes the studio as a place to retire, rather than a space to innovate and create the next generation of video games. At this rate, Valve will never outrun its reputation as the studio where talented game developers go to die (professionally speaking). \nBut, hey, at least they're not getting laid off en masse. Which, unfortunately, brings us to the next headline.\nYour favorite studio’s favorite studio faces layoffs\nCyberpunk 2077, Sea of Thieves and Dune: Awakening support studio Virtuos is laying off 270 developers, which is about seven percent of its staff. Virtuos is currently best known as the studio behind The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remastered alongside Bethesda, and it has more than 4,000 employees across Asia, Europe and North America. The cuts affect developers in Asia and Europe, with “fewer than 10” in France, where work on Oblivion Remastered was headquartered.\nHeck yeah, there’s gonna be a Hellraiser game\nMake sure to pin this one on your calendar. Saber Interactive is making Clive Barker's Hellraiser: Revival, a first-person, action-survival horror game that features actor Doug Bradley as Pinhead for the first time in nearly 20 years. Barker himself provided input on the story, too. It’s coming to PlayStation 5, PC and Xbox Series X/S, with no release date yet.\n\"The Hellraiser universe is defined by its unflinching exploration of pain, pleasure, and the thin and terrifying line that separates the two,\" a description from Saber Interactive reads. \"That essence is at the heart of our game.\"\n\nAn inside look at the fallout of the Zenimax layoffs\nGame Developer reporter Chris Kerr spoke with a number of employees at Zenimax who are still reeling from the layoffs that Microsoft enacted in early July. The vibes there sound pretty terrible.\n“This carcass of workers that remains is somehow supposed to keep shipping award-winning games,\" one senior QA tester told Kerr. The developer continued, “Microsoft just took everything that could have been great about the culture and collaboration and decimated it. Morale is terrible. It's grotesque. People are stressed. They're crying.”\nXbox cloud play anywhere\nWhen Xbox isn’t firing thousands of employees in one blow, it’s quietly laying the groundwork for the future of video game distribution. An update for Xbox Insiders this week introduces cross-platform cloud support, bringing your cloud library and play history to the Xbox PC app. This means you can access cloud activity on an Xbox console, PC or Windows handheld, and seamlessly play cloud games across devices. This is just how video games are going to work in the coming decades, and it’s interesting to watch our future slowly roll out in blog posts and software updates.\nSubnautica 2 scandal catch-up\nDid you miss all of the mess around Subnautica 2 last week? Or, more accurately, this past month? To quickly summarize, Subnautica publisher Krafton is being sued by the series creators after it fired them and then delayed their game, allegedly sabotaging a $250 million bonus payout due to developers. To not-quickly summarize, see my complete breakdown of the drama.\nMy Melody & Kuromi hits Netflix this week\nI don’t know who else needs a little levity in their life right now, but I certainly do.

    "full_text": "The first is a space for short essays and ramblings about video game trends and related topics from me, Jess Conditt, a reporter who's covered the industry for more than 13 years. I’ve included a few more than usual this week, as penance for my popsicle state. Supermassive is also working on Little Nightmares III, a series that it took over from Tarsier Studios. It makes sense that Supermassive would prioritize Little Nightmares III in order to fulfill its obligations with Bandai. Remedy Entertainment is aware of this hard truth and has a plan to fix it. PCGamesN published an interview with Counter-Strike co-creator Minh Le, who left Valve years ago to try out independent development. It’s not presented as an indictment of Valve, but I find it notable that Le describes the studio as a place to retire, rather than a space to innovate and create the next generation of video games. At this rate, Valve will never outrun its reputation as the studio where talented game developers go to die (professionally speaking). Game Developer reporter Chris Kerr spoke with a number of employees at Zenimax who are still reeling from the layoffs that Microsoft enacted in early July . “This carcass of workers that remains is somehow supposed to keep shipping award-winning games,\" one senior QA tester told Kerr."

If cybercriminals know a ransomware attack against a UK school or hospital won't get them paid, they'll look somewhere else for a more lucrative target. Security Minister Dan Jarvis said that the government is \"determined to smash the cyber criminal business model,\" and added that laws in the proposed package will require even private businesses to seek guidance from the government before paying a ransom.\nSince the WannaCry attack on the NHS in 2017 launched the modern era of ransomware attacks, the UK has suffered a number of serious incidents.

    "summary": "Meta is no longer paying creators to post on Threads. The company quietly ended the Threads bonus program, which offered some creators thousands of dollars a month in bonuses, earlier this year, Engadget has confirmed.\nThe company hasn't officially commented on why it stopped the payments, but an Instagram support page that once listed details about the creator incentives no longer references Threads at all. In posts on Threads, creators who were once part of the program have said they stopped receiving payments around the end of April. That's roughly one year after Meta first started paying creators for popular posts. Though Meta never publicly shared a lot of details about how the program worked, creators who previously spoke with Engadget reported that they were able to earn monthly bonuses ranging from $500 to $5,000 in exchange for hitting specific metrics around post counts and views.\nIt's not clear what Meta's strategy for creators on Threads is going forward. The company is still trying to lure more brands and notable faces to the platform, and has tested features to help people find popular creators they previously followed on X. Meta has also added creator-friendly tools, like the ability to add more links to profiles and more detailed analytics for the app.\nBut Meta has yet to clearly explain what it can offer creators in return. The platform is hardly driving any traffic to outside websites. It's also much harder to build a following on Threads, since the platform defaults to an algorithmic timeline consisting mainly of recommended content. This means that it's easier for a post from an unknown account to go viral, but viral posts rarely lead to an influx of new followers.\nMeta may simply be calculating that Threads already has enough momentum without paying people for viral content. At the same time, Mark Zuckerberg has repeatedly said he believes the app can be Meta's next billion-user platform.

    "summary": "Gamers aren't usually known for their sartorial elegance. But that doesn't mean we don't deserve nice things. So after checking out a very utilitarian carrying case for the Switch 2, I wanted to explore the other side of things with a more lavish travel bag. And while Waterfield's Magnetic case for Nintendo's latest console certainly isn't the most rugged or affordable way to lug a handheld console around, it might just be the most luxurious.\nDesign: Drape me in this leather\nCompared to most Switch 2 travel bags that are made out of materials like plastic and polyester, Waterfield's case is an exercise in opulence. It's crafted from buttery full-grain leather that's softer than than a perfectly worn in baseball mitt or fancy Dior gloves. It really is that nice. \n \nI've been using the white leather model as I love how clean and simple it looks while still giving you that irresistible pillowy exterior. But for the kind of folk who get excited about patina, the chocolate model features a more distressed look that isn't afraid to show off oil, scuffs and blemishes. And if the need arises, you can always hit the case with hot air from a hair dryer to reduce the appearance of scratches.\nBut the thing that sets Waterfield's case apart from its competition is that instead of relying on a zipper, the pouch has a series of magnets to keep everything together. And honestly, there's just something really nice about not having any sharp objects near or around the case, so there's no fear of your Switch 2 getting nicked. This enclosure system also makes it super simple to thread a cable inside, allowing you to charge Nintendo's latest handheld without it needing to leave the safety of its case. On a practical level, I've also found that because taking the console in and out is so quick and easy, I'm much better about putting things back when I'm done gaming.\nThe obvious downside to this is that it's easier for stuff like sand to get inside and if you're storing tiny accessories like a microSD Express card, there's no real guarantee it won't fall out while you're in transit. Additionally, the trade-off for the case's fancy leather exterior is that it doesn't have the hard, rigid panels used in a lot of competitors, so it's not the most rugged travel companion. If you press down on the outside of the case, you can feel things like console's buttons and joysticks, so this definitely isn't something you'll want to cram into an already stuffed piece of luggage.\nOn the inside, Waterfield's case is lined with a plush microfiber fabric that will keep the Switch 2 nice and cozy. There are also two pockets for stashing small items like charging cables, game cartridges or Joy-Con straps. But I do mean small, because anything larger will cause the case to bulge, which may put undue stress on the console.\nOptional accessories\n\n\n\n\n   Sam Rutherford for Engadget \n \n\nThis case doesn't come with much in the way of bundled extras. Though like a lot of luxury products (just look at the options list on a Porsche or Ferrari), you can purchase additional accessories such as cord clips, AirTag holders and more. But the most important of these are Waterfield's game card holders, which are available in several sizes (4, 10 and 20). So I went and bought a 10-slot sleeve and it really is the perfect complement to the case. Cartridges fit snug and the holder itself nestles neatly into the pouch's built-in pockets. I just wish one came included, as you're looking at an extra $10 to $30 on top of an already pricey travel protector.\nWrap-up\nStarting at $90 for the nylon or waxed canvas models or $120 for the leather versions, Waterfield's Magnetic Case for the Switch 2 certainly ain't cheap. That's more expensive than Belkin's Charging Case, which comes with its own battery pack. And that's before you factor in a game card holder.\n\n\n\n\n   Sam Rutherford for Engadget \n \n\nBut the sheer suppleness of its leather and its super soft interior might be the comfiest cocoon Nintendo's handheld will ever experience. Then you add in a magnetic enclosure system and it feels like Waterfield has managed to transform a product that might normally be an afterthought into something that's a joy to use all by itself. So for those who want a travel pouch that looks and feels just as good as the console it's protecting (if not better), this case is in a class of its own.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/waterfield-magnetic-case-review-the-most-lavish-way-to-carry-your-switch-2-around-200052731.html?src=rss",

This goes live on July 31, allowing folks to juice up at more than 12,000 Supercharger stations throughout North America. Some of the company's vehicles can already use these charging stations, with the Gravity SUV gaining access earlier this year.\nThat leaves the Air line of luxury EV sedans. These vehicles will be able to roll up to a Tesla Supercharger for a top-off at the end of the month, but there are some major caveats. First of all, Lucid Air EVs will require an official adapter that costs $220, as they don't ship with a built-in NACS ports. This adapter won't work with V1 or V2 charging stations, which whittles down the convenience factor a bit.\nThere's another problem for Air owners. The adapter is limited to a 50kW peak charge rate, which provides around 200 miles of range per hour of charging. The Air can typically achieve a 300kW peak charge rate. Not only is this hobbled charge rate bad for Lucid Air devotees, it's also annoying for people that own other EVs. Remember, the Air will have to sit at the charger for an entire hour, which will increase traffic at the station.\nLuckily, there are other charging stations available that make use of that 300kW peak rate. Air owners can use stations by Electrify America, EVgo and ChargePoint for a quick jolt. It's good to know that the Tesla Superchargers will be there in a pinch, which could come in handy during a road trip.\n\n\nThe company also recently unveiled the 2026 lineup of Air EVs. There's the Lucid Air Pure, which is a relatively streamlined option. Prices for this one start at $70,900. The Lucid Air Touring boasts an estimated range of 431 miles per charge, which is a decent metric. It starts at $79,900. Finally, the Lucid Air Grand Touring is the baddest of the bunch, with an estimated range of 512 miles per charge.

    "summary": "The Chinese Room, maker of Still Wakes the Deep, has bought back its independence. The studio will continue developing new franchises after splitting from the Sumo Group. The latter said earlier this year that it's pivoting away from original games and toward co-development work. Tencent bought the British studio Sumo for $1.27 billion in 2021.\nGame Developer reported that VC firm Hiro Capital facilitated the Chinese Room's independence deal. Studio head Ed Daly told the publication on Monday that the company is open to partnering with other developers moving forward.\nUnfortunately, the studio's good news is tainted with an all-too-familiar story. The studio confirmed to Game Developer that it will lay off an undisclosed number of employees as part of the split. \"Following the divestment process, a number of roles were regrettably made redundant,\" a company spokesperson said. \"The specifics are confidential, but the studio is currently 55 developers. This was a very difficult process as we sought a future for the studio outside of Sumo.

The Game Capture 4K S works with just about any modern console, PC or handheld gaming device, including the Switch 2.

Elgato's higher-end 4K X supports 4K capture at 144 fps but costs quite a bit more.\nThough a more affordable model, the 4K S doesn't skimp where it matters. The new capture card features zero-latency passthrough to your main display, and Elgato says latency in software previews can be as low as 30 milliseconds. Short of the most competitive FPS games, this is fast enough to play on a single screen if you must. If you are trying to capture a game like Valorant or CS2 and care more about frame rate than raw resolution, the 4K S can record at 1440p120 or 1080p240.\nThe 4K S also supports HDR10 passthrough up to 4K60, HDR10 capture to 1080p60 on Windows, VRR support and it has an analog audio jack for native team chat. The device is plug-and-play over USB-C for Windows 11, macOS and iPadOS. For those whose creative workflow lives on iPad, the 4K S can capture directly to iPad models with a USB-C port. Thanks to UVC compliance, the device is compatible with OBS Studio, Streamlabs, Zoom, TikTok Live Studio and other major broadcast apps.\n\nElgato is also releasing its newest capture application, Elgato Studio, which will replace 4KCU in the coming months.

You can also use AI to generate custom watch faces using the Watch Face Studio, in which you’ll find more than 120 styles premade out of the box. Widgets can be applied for fitness, weather, music or reminders, with a full-screen option available.\nCMF’s latest wearable has a 1.43-inch AMOLED, always-on display, and you’re getting a 10 percent increase in screen-to-body ratio compared to the Watch Pro 2 before it. Battery life is 13 days with \"typical\" use, which Nothing says is a two-day improvement over its predecessor. If you're hitting the tracking hard you can expect around 11 days of juice on a full charge. With the always-on display enabled, battery life unsurprisingly takes a significant hit to around 4.5 days.\nNothing says the Watch 3 Pro and all other smartwatches in the CMF lineup now use the Nothing X app, with the new control centre promising improved stability and a more intuitive UI. It also plays nice with Strava, Apple Health, and Google Health Connect\nYou’re getting a fair bit of bang for your buck, then, but we’ll have to wait and see how the Watch 3 Pro fares against pricier alternatives where everyday performance is concerned. When TechRadar reviewed the Watch 2 Pro earlier this year, it had lots of positive impressions of the watch, but noted some spotty fitness tracking and sensor detection. 9to5Google was even more critical, finding fault with the heart rate tracking and concluding that the product felt unfinished. And while the Watch 3 Pro covers a lot of the bases for fitness watches with its various sensors, it still lacks NFC for payments, which could be a deal-breaker for some people.\nAvailable in Dark Grey, Light Grey, and Orange colorways, the CMF Watch 3 Pro costs $99 (a not insignificant $30 bump on the Watch Pro 2) is available to buy now.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wearables/nothings-99-cmf-watch-3-pro-offers-better-battery-life-and-ai-fitness-coaching-151058055.html?src=rss",

But to get the most out of it, you’ll need the right accessories to match. That’s where AirTag accessories come in, helping you attach, protect and style your tracker in a way that suits your daily routine.Whether you're looking for a low-profile AirTag wallet insert, a rugged AirTag mount for your bike or pet’s collar or an Apple AirTag holder with multiple color options that adds a personal touch, there’s no shortage of great options. Some accessories come in hard plastic or hard shell designs for extra durability, while others double as a sleek protective case or minimalist tag holder.

If you're comfortable slipping an AirTag into an interior pocket of a bag or coat, you can do so without an extra accessory. But if you want to use one to keep track of your keys, wallet, backpack or even your pet on their collar, you'll need an accessory that can accommodate that use case.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-apple-airtag-cases-holders-accessories-123036404.html?src=rss",

But if you’d rather hook the tracker to the outside, you’ll need something a bit larger and more flexible than a standard key ring. Belkin’s Secure Holder with Strap is a good option: it comes in different colors and it’s budget friendly at only $13. The case opens up into two pieces, allowing you to sit the AirTag inside the circle and twist and snap the two halves together to lock it in. You can then attach the AirTag to your luggage handle, dog collar, water bottle or other item with the strap, which feels quite strong. I appreciate the unique design of Belkin’s Secure Holder, although it was hard to twist open when the AirTag was inside of it. But that’s a good thing for daily use; your AirTag isn’t going anywhere when in the Secure Holder. I also liked its slightly raised edges, which provide extra protection against impacts and bumps."

    "summary": "As is tradition, Google has already shown off at least one of its new Pixel phones before it's announced. The front page of the Google Store currently features a short video teasing one of the Pixel 10 smartphones the company is announcing on August 20.\nIf you take the webpage literally, then Google's video is showing off the base Pixel 10, which has a similar look to the Pixel 9, with some key differences. Those include a new grayish-blue finish, a tweaked back design that makes the back of the phone looks like it's rising out of the frame and an additional camera. If you haven't gotten to try a Pixel 9, last year's phone only had wide and ultrawide cameras, with the telephoto lens exclusive to the Pixel 9 Pro models. Leaks suggest Google is giving all of its phones telephoto cameras in 2025, though it's still possible the phone in the video is a Pixel 10 Pro.\nThere's not much to glean from the video beyond that. Some of that could be because of the more modest approach Google is rumored to be taking with its new phones, focusing on technical improvements — like a new Tensor chip — rather than radical new designs.\nGoogle runs a leaky ship when it comes to hardware, with most of its new products reported on well in advance of the company actually announcing them.

    "full_text": "As is tradition, Google has already shown off at least one of its new Pixel phones before it's announced. The front page of the Google Store currently features a short video teasing one of the Pixel 10 smartphones the company is announcing on August 20. If you take the webpage literally, then Google's video is showing off the base Pixel 10, which has a similar look to the Pixel 9, with some key differences. Those include a new grayish-blue finish, a tweaked back design that makes the back of the phone looks like it's rising out of the frame and an additional camera. If you haven't gotten to try a Pixel 9, last year's phone only had wide and ultrawide cameras, with the telephoto lens exclusive to the Pixel 9 Pro models. Leaks suggest Google is giving all of its phones telephoto cameras in 2025, though it's still possible the phone in the video is a Pixel 10 Pro. There's not much to glean from the video beyond that.

    "summary": "Whether it’s your nephew who wants a new iPad, your sister who needs a new pair of AirPods or your parent who could benefit from an easy-to-use MacBook, Apple devices are some of the most in-demand devices you can get today. That means, unfortunately, that big discounts are few and far between, and they’re often the first to sell out when sales do arise. But make no mistake: you can find good Apple deals across the web, you just have to know where to look.\nEngadget keeps track of deals like these regularly, so we’re here to help. We’ve collected the best Apple deals on items like AirPods, MacBooks, iPads and more that you can get right now. Just note: you’ll find the best Apple deals from retailers like Amazon, Best Buy, Walmart, Target and others — not directly from Apple. Unless you shop refurbished, you’ll always pay top dollar direct at Apple, and for some things (like iPhones), that might be the best route to take.  \nBest Apple Watch deals\n \nApple Watch SE for $169 (32 percent off): We wouldn’t be surprised to see an update to Apple’s budget smartwatch sometime soon (and we have a few suggestions on the matter). But thanks to some serious discounts, the Apple Watch SE has turned out to be the most affordable way to get an iPhone companion for your wrist. Despite the lackluster screen and limited extra features, it handles the basics well. Also at Best Buy and Walmart.\nBest AirPods deals\n \nBest iPad deals\n \niPad Pro (M4, 11-inch) for $899 ($100 off): The most powerful iPad is the iPad Pro, and it’s the one to get if you’re even toying with the idea of using your new slab as a laptop replacement. Both the 11- and 13-inch models have gorgeous displays, thinner and lighter designs, a repositioned front camera and the excessively powerful M4 chip inside. Also at Best Buy. \nBest MacBook deals\n \nApple MacBook Air (15-inch, M3, 24GB RAM) for $1,299 ($400 off): The last-gen M3 MacBook Air has officially been discontinued, but it remains a superb laptop while the last bits of stock remain available. We gave this 15-inch model a score of 90 in our review — outside of its slower chip (which is still plenty fast for everyday use), marginally improved camera and inability to power two external displays with the lid open, it's virtually identical to the newer version. This deal applies to the model with the larger 24GB of memory in the Starlight colorway. \nMacBook Air (M3, 15-inch) for $949 ($350 off): The base model M3 MacBook Air is also available at a sizeable discount..\nApple MacBook Air (15-inch, M4) for $1,049 ($150 off): The 15-inch MacBook Air is nearly identical to the smaller version but features more robust speakers and a more spacious trackpad alongside its roomier display. Also at B&H.\nBest Apple accessories deals\nApple Pencil (USB-C) for $69 ($10 off): This more affordable Apple Pencil doesn’t support pressure sensitivity, but it still makes for a useful stylus for the basics. If you’re a casual note-taker and can live without wireless charging, you’ll save a few bucks by picking this one up. Also available at Walmart.\nApple Pencil (2nd gen) for $90 ($39 off): The Second gen Pencil both attaches and charges magnetically, supports tilt and pressure sensitivity and allows for tool changes with a tap of the flat edge. It’s an older pencil and isn’t compatible with the latest iPad models. This is the lowest price we’ve tracked this year, but it went as low as $80 for last year’s Black Friday sales.\nRead more Apple coverage:\n\nThe best AirPods\nThe best Apple Watches\nThe best MacBooks\nThe best iPhones\nThe best iPads\n\nFollow @EngadgetDeals on X for the latest tech deals and buying advice.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/best-apple-deals-150020110.html?src=rss",

This reminds me of the first installment of the Final Fantasy VII remake that was entirely set in Midgar.\nUnfortunately, we have some time to wait before we get our hands on this mod. The trailer indicates a release date in 2027. There's also the Bethesda-sized elephant in the room. Who knows if the company's lawyers will go on a letter-writing spree to get this project shut down. \nReally been pushing Alexander to make sure we've got a living, breathing, retro-futuristic (but sometimes seedy) world for NB RPG.

    "summary": "We are mere days away from the official launch of the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 on July 25. Amazon is enticing customers to try out the foldable handset by throwing in a $300 gift card with every pre-order. This can be used to purchase anything on the platform and is available with every color and both the 256GB and 512GB versions of the Z Fold 7.\nWe strongly recommend going for the 512GB model, as the two storage options are the same price ($2,000) during this pre-order period. Samsung is offering a similar promotion, but that $300 gift card can only be used on the company's official store. This could be a good fit for those looking for accessories, but Amazon offers more bang for your buck. \n \nDespite not actually being out yet, the Z Fold 7 is already making a splash in the foldable scene. We were so impressed with our review unit that we placed the gadget at the top of our list of the best foldable phones. It's a remarkably thin device, with a sleekly-designed hinge that stays out of the way when opened.\nThe 200MP main camera is fantastic, the specs are unparalleled and both displays are gorgeous. We called it a \"stunning device\" in our official review, going on to praise the 120Hz refresh rate of both screens and the peak brightness of 2,600 nits.
