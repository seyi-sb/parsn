Apple has removed the iPhone torrenting client, iTorrent, from AltStore PAL’s alternative iOS marketplace in the EU, showing that it can still exert control over apps that aren’t listed on the official App Store. iTorrent developer Daniil Vinogradov told TorrentFreak that Apple has revoked his distribution rights to publish apps in any alternative iOS stores, so the issue isn’t tied to AltStore PAL itself. “Apple removed Alternative Distribution functionality from iTorrent’s Developer Portal without any warning,” Vinogradov said on iTorrent’s Github page. Apple has not provided a reason for the removal, according Vinogradov, and distribution was revoked at the Apple Dev Account level. The matter is also being investigated by AltStore PAL. While Apple bans torrent apps on its own iOS store, the EU’s Digital Markets Act gave iPhone users within the bloc greater freedom to install apps from third-party app stores that the Cupertino company doesn’t directly manage. iTorrent was added to AltStore PAL in July last year, which raises the question: why now?"

    "full_text": "It would allow Apple to capitalize on the skinny phone hype while also diverting attention from its fledgling AI efforts. It might also help to silence critics who say the iPhone's design has become too predictable in recent years – though consumers don't seem to be demanding skinny phones as much as other attributes, like better cameras and longer battery life. \"Slimness is a factor that can be clearly marketed, unlike uncertain use cases for AI.\" Charging more for an innovative design could be a more straightforward pitch than trying to monetize a phone's AI features, especially since platforms like Gemini and ChatGPT have free tiers -- and the smarter, Apple Intelligence-powered Siri that Apple promised in 2024 has yet to arrive. But there might be more to Apple's long-term plan than simply releasing a slimmer iPhone 17. She adds that minimizing the screen's crease (which Apple is reportedly doing in partnership with Samsung Display) can help it stand out. If Apple debuts a foldable next year, it could also be thin to compete with phones like the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7. Still, Apple quickly dominated those spaces -- and it's possible the rollout of a foldable iPhone could follow suit. It also faces mounting pressure due to its slower rollout of Apple Intelligence, which is still leagues behind what competitors like Samsung and Google have loaded onto their devices. Foldables remain a niche category, and Apple's entry could give the form factor a significant boost, thanks to the company's scores of loyal fans and its tendency to usher innovation into well-established categories."

The Backbone One provides a good grip for playing games but at $100 it's expensive. There are so many options for connecting gaming controllers to an iPhone, but none fit exactly right. These are great for letting me use my console controller with the iPhone, and I can choose to either use a Bluetooth connection or hardwire my controller to the iPhone. For instance, Sega released Sonic Dream Team in 2023 on Apple Arcade to largely positive reviews. While streaming exclusives are common on video services like Netflix and Amazon Prime, for gaming it's not ideal for me to only be able to access a title while I have an active subscription. By limiting these services further to just a web app, it's blocking them. Apple does allow some game streaming in limited circumstances on apps you can download from the App Store. We're already seeing prices rise across all Xbox consoles and older Nintendo Switch handhelds. You can also check out early impressions of the Games app in iOS 26, which my colleague Zachary McAuliffe has been testing."

Prohibiting electronic access to your SSN may feel inconvenient and extreme. But if you've experienced identity theft or your personal identifiable information was compromised in a recent data breach -- like the hacks of Change Healthcare, Hertz or National Public Data -- locking your SSN could protect you from future harm. You can contact the SSA at 1-800-772-1213 between 8 a.m. and 7 p.m. local time, Monday through Friday. You can also create a MyE-Verify online account to lock your SSN and use the service's self-lock feature. This resource comes in handy because many employers use E-Verify, a service administered by SSA and the US Citizenship and Immigration Services, to check your employment eligibility. For added protection against tax identity theft, you can create an identity protection pin with the IRS to prevent someone else from filing a tax return with your SSN or individual taxpayer identification number.

Robinson shared the following tips for how students can use AI to write ethically: Robinson said that essentially, these are all tips a good editor or journalism professor would be able to share with you, but they can be helpful in moments when you don't have immediate access to one.

    "summary": "If your Wi-Fi signal is struggling to reach every corner of your home, a signal booster — also known as a Wi-Fi extender — might be the fix you need. Whether you're dealing with annoying dead zones, buffering video calls or laggy gaming sessions, the right Wi-Fi extender can help expand coverage and improve connectivity without forcing you to move your router.There are different types of Wi-Fi extenders to choose from. Some models use external antennas to push the signal farther, while others, like mesh extenders, create a seamless, whole-home network. If you're simply looking to extend coverage into a specific room, a Wi-Fi repeater can do the job — but it may cut your bandwidth in half. More advanced extenders, however, can help maintain strong speeds and reliability throughout your home.We've rounded up the best Wi-Fi extenders to suit different needs, whether you're looking for an affordable fix or a high-performance upgrade.\nTable of contents\n\nBest Wi-Fi extender for 2025\nHow do Wi-Fi extenders work?\nWhat to look for in a Wi-Fi extender\nWi-Fi extender FAQs\n\nBest Wi-Fi extender for 2025\n \n \n \nHow do Wi-Fi extenders work?\nThese handy wireless devices do exactly what their name suggests: extend your Wi-Fi network so it covers more areas of your home. Most wireless extenders plug into an AC outlet and connect to your existing router so they can then rebroadcast it to spots that your router alone may not cover well. As a rule of thumb, you’ll get the best results by placing the extender half way between your router and the dead zone you’re trying to fix or improve your W-Fi connection and strengthen the wireless signal. \nOne important thing to note about Wi-Fi range extenders (also sometimes called “repeaters”) is that most of them actually create a new Wi-Fi network when rebroadcasting your existing one. That network will have a new name (it’ll often be your default network’s name with an EXT appended at the end, unless you change it) and that means you’ll have to connect to different networks when in different parts of your home. While that’s a small tradeoff in return for improved internet connection, some will be more inconvenienced than others.\nIf you’d rather have one, much larger network in your home, you’re better off upgrading to mesh networking systems. Mesh systems come with a main router and a wireless access point or two that, by default, create one large Wi-Fi system that should be accessible throughout your whole home. They tend to be the best Wi-Fi routers you can get, but that also translates to more expensive, and possibly more complicated, devices. Mesh Wi-Fi systems are, by far, more costly than a simple extender, plus you may have to work with your internet service provider to get your home’s existing network working on your new router.\nWhat to look for in a Wi-Fi extender\nSpeed\nExtenders today can support single, dual or tri-band Wi-Fi, and they will tell you the maximum speeds they support on all of their available bands. For example, one dual-band device might support 600Mbps speeds over its 2.4GHz band and up to 1300Mbps over its 5GHz band, for a combined maximum speed of 1900Mbps. For the best performance, you’ll want to go with a Wi-Fi extender that has the highest speeds possible (and those, as you might expect, tend to cost more). Some extenders even support Wi-Fi 7, giving you the latest in wireless technology for higher bandwidth, faster internet speed and lower latency.\nHowever, it’s important to remember that Wi-Fi extenders are not true “signal boosters” since they are not designed to increase speeds across your home. In fact, you may find that the extender’s network is slower than your router’s. Instead, extenders are designed to increase the strong Wi-Fi coverage throughout your home, making them ideal for filling in dead zones. Some mesh extenders can help create a more seamless network, reducing the drop in speed and improving connectivity in larger spaces.\nRange, and number of supported devices\nWith the name of the gaming being coverage area, taking note of a device’s range is important. Depending on the size of your home and property, you may only need up to 1,200 square feet of coverage. But those with larger homes will want to spring for an extender that can support upwards of 2,000+ square feet of coverage.\nSimilarly, those with lots of gadgets will want an extender that can handle them all at once. If you spend most of your time on your phone or laptop and maybe have your smart TV online for a few hours of Netflix each day, you could get by with a more limited extender. Smart home aficionados and tech lovers should invest in one that won’t buckle under the pressure of a few dozen connected devices. This is especially important if you plan on linking all of the devices in a certain part of your home to your Wi-Fi range extender’s network, rather than directly to your existing router. Some models with external antennas can improve performance by providing stronger, more directional wireless signal.\nDesign\nThere isn’t a ton of innovation when it comes to design in the Wi-Fi extender space. Most of the ones you’ll find today are rounded rectangles roughly the size of your hand that plug into a standard wall outlet. They usually have a few indicator lights that will show you when the extender is connected, how strong its signal strength is and when there’s a problem, and some will even have moveable external antennas that companies claim provide even better Wi-Fi signal. Generally, they are pretty simple to install and get connected, but if you’re struggling with how to set up your Wi-Fi extender, there are plenty of YouTube videos you can check out.\nAside from that, there are the scant few standalone Wi-Fi extenders that sit on an end table or a desk, and those look pretty similar to regular ol’ routers. But make no mistake, anything labeled as an extender or a “Wi-Fi repeater” will need an anchor router in order for it to work.\nAnother convenient feature you’ll find on most Wi-Fi extenders is an extra Ethernet connection port (or a few). This allows you to use the extender as a wireless access point if you connect it to your existing router, or an adapter to provide devices like TVs, smart home hubs or game consoles a hardwired connection to the internet. Unsurprisingly, this wired connection usually provides you with the fastest speeds possible, so you may want to use it for your most crucial devices.\nWi-Fi extender FAQs\nWhat's the difference between a wifi booster and extender?\nNowadays, there’s really no difference between a Wi-Fi booster and Wi-Fi extender - they’re just different names for the same thing. Previously, however, Wi-Fi boosters were devices that received signals from wireless routers, broadcasting them to another network. This essentially extends the range of the signal. Wi-Fi extenders expand the coverage within your home’s Wi-Fi network, but often you will see extenders described as boosters.\nIs a Wi-Fi extender better than a mesh router?\nMesh routers, or mesh Wi-Fi systems, use multiple devices (or nodes) across your home to create a larger home network. Essentially, you have multiple routers around your home with these systems, and that will hopefully provide the best coverage possible. Wi-Fi extenders, on the other hand, are usually just one device that extends your existing Wi-Fi signal, and they often require you to switch networks when connecting. Wi-Fi extenders are more affordable, though, and are great if you’re traveling or need a Wi-Fi signal in harder-to-reach areas. However, a mesh router can offer a better long-term solution to upgrade your entire home’s Wi-Fi.\nShould I use multiple Wi-Fi extenders?\nSome people may need to use multiple Wi-Fi extenders, for instance, if your home is large or has dead zones in different areas. But if you do use multiple Wi-Fi extenders, there’s a chance of interference. You may also need to manually connect to the extenders separately, which isn’t always convenient.\nWhat is the maximum distance for a Wi-Fi extender?\nThe maximum distance for a Wi-Fi extender varies depending on the model, but most can effectively extend your wireless signal between 800 and 2,500 square feet. Some high-end models may reach even farther, especially if they feature external antennas or are part of a mesh system with additional dedicated wireless access points.\nHowever, keep in mind that real-world performance depends on factors like your home's layout, wall materials and interference from other devices. For best results, place your extender about halfway between your router and the area with weak or no Wi-Fi connection. Always check the manufacturer’s specs — some of our top picks clearly list their expected range so you can find one that fits your space.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/best-wifi-extender-130021313.html?src=rss",

AI chatbots have seen their memories grow longer this year. Other tools, like OpenAI's ChatGPT and xAI's Grok, also offer forms of memory, allowing you to refer to older conversations or save certain information for future reference. But these memory features come with their own problems -- personalization can change the behavior and output as a large language model tries to do what it thinks you want rather than what you ask it to do. You also may not want it to save (and regurgitate) private or sensitive information. The Gemini app will default to saving information about you and learning from it. When that feature is turned on, it'll remember things you share and incorporate them into how it answers future prompts.

However, there are some eye care tactics you can use to limit the effect that digital screens have on your eyes. Other strategies to protect your eyes from digital screens include lowering the brightness on your devices, switching to dark mode and wearing blue-light-blocking glasses, though research is iffy on these glasses for eye health. If your case is more severe, you may experience blurred vision or blind spots. Aside from wearing sunglasses, there are other effective ways to protect your eyes while you're spending time outside. If you've ever woken up from a poor night's sleep with dry and itchy eyes, you've experienced how a lack of quality sleep can impact your eye health, and science backs that up."

    "summary": "Figuring out the best iPad for you can be tricky. Apple now sells three 11-inch tablets and two 13-inch ones, each with key differences in pricing, specs and accessory support. The iPad mini is still hanging around, too. Ahead of the big changes coming with the iPadOS 26 update later this year, we’ve tested each current iPad and broken down which ones best fit different needs, whether you want a laptop replacement or just a big screen for streaming.\nTable of contents\n\nThe best iPads for 2025\nHow we test the best iPads\niPad FAQs\nRecent updates\n\nThe best iPads for 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow we test the best iPads\n\n\n\n  The top edge of the iPad mini.\n \n\n  Photo by Nathan Ingraham / Engadget\n \n\nMuch like we do for our guide to the best tablets overall, we spend several days with each iPad to see how they feel and perform with different tasks: watching videos, web browsing, playing both casual and graphically intense games, editing 4K photos and video, running multiple apps side-by-side, making FaceTime calls and the like. To better measure performance specifically, we use benchmarking tests like Geekbench 6, 3DMark and GFXBench Metal, plus we measure how long it takes for each tablet to boot up and open various apps. We also check how well each tablet holds up long-term, whether it’s with a review unit provided by Apple or an iPad model that’s owned by a member of the Engadget staff. \nTo help compare the color performance and brightness of the displays, we play the same videos on different iPads, side-by-side, at equal brightness levels. We use each tablet in direct sunlight outdoors to see how well they hold up to glare, and we play a handful of the same musical tracks to evaluate speaker performance. For battery life, we keep track of how long each tablet generally lasts before it needs a recharge, but we also play a 1080p movie on a loop at roughly 70 percent brightness with power-sapping background processes off. We also test each device with an Apple Pencil and note how responsive the stylus feels. Finally, we carefully pore over spec sheets and software updates to keep track of which features are available on certain iPads but not others.\niPad FAQs\n\n\n\n  The iPad (A16) on top of an 13-inch iPad Air.\n \n\n  Jeff Dunn for Engadget\n \n\nWhat are some new features coming to iPadOS 26?\nApple first previewed iPadOS 26 during its WWDC keynote in June. The update looks to be a major overhaul, one that brings iPadOS closer to macOS than ever before. New features include the ability to open more windows simultaneously and resize or tile them more freely; a Mac-style Menu bar; a dedicated Preview app; an upgraded Files app; an improved ability to export or download large files in the background; an Exposé view that shows all open windows; a pointier cursor and the option to add folders to the Dock. It’ll also use the new “liquid glass” design language Apple is rolling out across all of its platforms in 2025. Importantly, Apple says these features will be available across its tablet lineup, from the iPad Pro to the entry-level iPad. That could make the latter a particularly enticing value. You can find the full list of compatible devices at the bottom of Apple’s press release.\nHow long do iPads typically last?\nIf history is any indication, expect Apple to update your iPad to the latest version of iPadOS for at least five years, if not longer. The current iPadOS 18 update, for example, is available on iPad Pro models dating back to 2018 and other iPads dating back to 2019. How long your iPad’s hardware will last depends on which model you buy and how well you maintain it. (If you’re particularly clumsy, consider an iPad case.) A more powerful iPad Pro will feel fast for a longer time than an entry-level iPad, but each model should remain at least serviceable until Apple stops updating it, at minimum.\nWhat’s the difference between the iPad and the iPad Air?\nCompared to the 11th-gen iPad, the iPad Air runs on a stronger M3 chip (instead of the A16 Bionic) and has 2GB more RAM (8GB total). Both come with 128GB of storage by default. The Air is also available in two sizes, 11 and 13 inches, whereas the 11th-gen iPad doesn't offer the larger screen option. The M-series SoC gives the Air better long-term performance, plus access to certain iPadOS features such as Apple Intelligence and Stage Manager. Its display supports a wider P3 color gamut, has an antireflective coating and is fully laminated. The latter means there’s no “air gap” between the display and the glass covering it, so it feels more like you’re directly touching what’s on screen instead of interacting with an image below the glass. The Air also works with the newer Pencil Pro stylus and more comfortable Magic Keyboards, and its USB-C port supports faster data transfer speeds. It technically supports faster Wi-Fi 6E, too, while the lower-cost iPad uses Wi-Fi 6.  \nStarting at $349, the 11th-gen iPad is $250 less expensive than the iPad Air. It has a similarly elegant design with flat edges, thin bezels, USB-C port, and a Touch ID reader. Battery life is rated at the same 10 hours, and both devices have their front-facing camera on their long edge, which is a more natural position for video calls. The cheaper iPad works with the first-gen and USB-C Apple Pencils – which are more convoluted to charge – and a unique keyboard accessory called the Magic Keyboard Folio.\n\n\n\n\n  Jeff Dunn for Engadget\n \n\nWhat’s the difference between iPads and Android tablets?\nThe operating system, duh. But to give a few more specifics: Android devices are available from more manufacturers and cover a wider price range. You won’t see an $80 iPad anytime soon. Android is also more malleable in that you can easily sideload apps from places beyond Google’s official app store and more extensively customize the look of the OS. Several Android tablets still have features like a headphone jack or a microSD slot for adding storage, too, though those are getting rarer.\nBut we tend to recommend Apple tablets to those who have no allegiance either way. iPad apps are still a bit more likely to be designed specifically for larger screens, rather than looking like blown-up phone software, and Apple is just about peerless when it comes to long-term software support. Every new iPad hits a certain baseline of hardware quality and performance — none of them feel cheap, and all of them are fast enough for most needs. Plus, you’ll get the most out of an iPad if you use other Apple devices.\nCan an iPad replace a laptop?\nThis is a loaded question, since laptop workflows differ from person to person. If you mostly use a notebook for browsing the web, watching videos or writing emails and word docs, then sure, you can get along just fine with an iPad and the right iPad accessories. It’ll be easier to carry around, the battery life is great and having the touchscreen and stylus support is handy (though many Windows users have that regardless). Even beyond the basics, plenty of media editors, graphic designers and digital artists have shown they can get things done on an iPad.\nBroadly speaking, though, a laptop OS tends to be more flexible when it comes to file management, multitasking, coding or other “heavy” tasks. Safari on the iPad isn’t quite on par with desktop browsers either. So the answer really depends on you. That said, the iPadOS 26 update could close the gap, so check back on this in a couple of months.\nHow do I take a screenshot on an iPad?\nAs we note in our screenshot how-to guide, you can take a screenshot on your iPad by pressing the top button and either volume button at the same time. If you have an older iPad with a Home button, simultaneously press the top button and the Home button instead.\nRecent updates\nAugust 2025: We've taken another sweep to ensure our picks are still accurate and added a few more notes to our FAQ section.\nJune 2025: We’ve made a few minor edits to reflect the announcement of Apple’s latest iPadOS update, which we detail above.\nMay 2025: We’ve lightly edited this guide to ensure all details and links are still correct. We’re also keeping an eye on how the Trump administration’s tariff policy affects the pricing and stock of the iPad lineup (and every other tech category). All of our picks are still available at normal prices today, but we’ll update this guide if that changes.\nMarch 2025: We've reviewed the iPad (A16) and named it our new budget pick, removing the discontinued 10th-gen iPad in the process. \nMarch 2025: The recently-launched iPad Air M3 has replaced its predecessor as our top overall recommendation. We’ve also made a note regarding the new iPad (A16), which we plan to test in the near future and expect to become our new budget pick. We’ve made a handful of edits elsewhere in the guide to reflect Apple’s latest hardware.\nJanuary 2025: We’ve lightly edited this guide for clarity. Our recommendations remain the same.\nOctober 2024: We've updated our guide to include the new iPad mini 7.\nJune 2024: We’ve touched up this guide to reflect some of the new iPadOS features Apple announced at WWDC, though our picks remain the same.\nNathan Ingraham contributed to this report.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/best-ipads-how-to-pick-the-best-apple-tablet-for-you-150054066.html?src=rss",

Those looking to use the iPad Pro as a (very expensive) media consumption device don’t need this, but if you work with memory-hungry apps or need the absolute best, just note it’ll cost you.

An unnamed Microsoft spokesperson told GeekWire that the two employees were terminated “following serious breaches of company policies and our code of conduct.” Microsoft refused to provide an attributable statement to The Verge. Hours after the protesters were arrested, Brad Smith then held an emergency press conference in his office. Seated on the edge of his desk, Smith addressed a group of reporters and viewers on a YouTube live stream. Smith said that Microsoft is “committed to ensuring its human rights principles and contractual terms of service are upheld in the Middle East.” He said the company launched an investigation earlier this month after The Guardian reported that Microsoft’s Azure cloud platform was being used for surveillance of Palestinians. Hattle was previously arrested during protests at Microsoft’s headquarters last week, where Redmond police arrested 20 people after a group took over a plaza at Microsoft’s headquarters to protest against the company’s contracts with Israel. Protestors at Microsoft’s campus set up a “Liberated Zone” encampment, and poured red paint over a Microsoft sign on campus."

On Wednesday, the FDA approved the new round of COVID-19 vaccines from Pfizer, Moderna, and Novavax for use by seniors over the age of 65. But for anyone younger than that, the FDA approval only mentions people who have “at least one underlying condition that puts them at high risk for severe outcomes from COVID-19.” It also removed one option for children entirely, revoking the Pfizer vaccine’s emergency use authorization for children under 5. The Post says Monarez was “pressed for days” by Kennedy about whether she would support reworking the FDA’s policies. The Post reports that “at least three top CDC officials” have announced plans to resign, including Demetre Daskalakis, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, and Debra Houry, chief medical officer. After previewing the update in May, the government removed healthy pregnant people and children from its list of people recommended to receive the covid vaccine, which CNN reports has already prevented some people from getting vaccinated. In a tweet, Kennedy claims the actions will “keep vaccines available to people who want them, especially the vulnerable,” however, they could now require millions of Americans to prove they are at risk, putting an additional hurdle in the way of getting vaccinated. The New York Times reports that an upcoming CDC decision could impact availability and access at drugstore sites, as laws in some states require the CDC’s recommendation for pharmacy staff to administer the shots. As we noted last month, Kennedy recently fired 17 people from the federal committee (ACIP) responsible for making vaccine recommendations."

These AI factories have gotten bigger and bigger in recent years, with significant impacts on the communities around them and a greater strain on the US electric grid. Don't miss any of our unbiased tech content and lab-based reviews. A source of increased demand for computational power is that newer AI models that employ \"reasoning\" techniques are using a lot more power for one question. This technique allows an AI model to research on different websites, try a question multiple times to get better answers and put disparate information together into one response. But a reasoning model can require 100 times the computing power or more than what a traditional large language model response would take, Huang said. These models, along with agentic systems that can perform tasks and robotics models that can handle visualization and operate in the physical world, are keeping demand for chips, energy and data center land on the rise."

The Series 10 introduced faster charging -- 0% to 80% in just 30 minutes compared with 90 minutes on previous models -- but there's room for improvement in battery capacity itself. It would also be less precise than dedicated health devices like Omron's and measure baseline metrics like the Galaxy Watch 7 and Ultra (which isn't supported on Samsung watches in the US). Want a full breakdown of everything Apple announced, including the new iOS 26 and its eye-catching Liquid Glass design? WatchOS 26 also introduced an AI-powered Workout Buddy to the Apple Watch, offering encouragement and real-time feedback during specific workouts. The Series 11 (and Ultra 3) could push this further by leveraging their more powerful chipset. The new \"Health Plus\" app would likely arrive as part of an iOS 19 update, working in tandem with WatchOS 11 to gather and process data. It's not clear whether Apple would charge extra for these features, or if they'd be baked into the standard Health app at no additional cost. Apple often files patents well before any related technology appears in an actual product, so even if this concept does live to see the light of day, we're not expecting it to make its public debut anytime soon."

    "summary": "Apple on Tuesday finally announced that its iPhone 17 event will take place on Tuesday, September 9. So in just under two weeks, we'll get to take a first look at the new iPhone 17 lineup. If Apple keeps with tradition, expect to see iOS 26 available for download about one week after the event. If you can't wait any longer, you can download and install the newly released public beta 5 (or iOS 26 developer beta 8 for developers). I've been playing around with it for the past couple of weeks, and have found that taking screenshots is way better in the new operating system, as well as getting to choose how long you snooze. You can see a more complete view of the new features in our preview of the iOS 26 public beta release, which shows off the fresh home and lock screen redesign. Called Liquid Glass, the translucent look will extend across all of Apple's upcoming operating systems. The overhaul is one of several big changes coming to iOS, macOS, iPadOS and the rest of Apple's software suite, all of which were showcased during the company's WWDC keynote on June 9.\nAfter overpromising on AI plans last year, Apple kept its iOS roadmap focused more on basic quality of life improvements this year. There are multiple useful additions coming to the Phone and Messages apps on your iPhone, for instance: Apple execs outlined the ability to weed out spam texts or other unknown senders and an option to hold your spot on a phone call when you've been waiting for a representative to pick up. Plus, a treasured feature that we took for granted is coming back (hint: it's in the Photos app).\nSiri, meanwhile, is in a holding pattern. Apple has previously specified that its smarter voice assistant — first promised at WWDC 2024 — is delayed until some point \"in the coming year,\" so you shouldn't expect any major changes in the current betas. But there are reports that Apple is aiming to give Siri a bigger brain transplant by basing it on third-party artificial intelligence models like OpenAI's ChatGPT or Anthropic's Claude, which could make 2026 a pivotal year. The company is also reportedly working on a 'stripped-down' AI chatbot to rival ChatGPT.\nWith each beta, it seems like additional new improvements are popping up, like this new AirPods gesture we're all curious about, and this FaceTime feature that'll freeze your video if it detects nudity. With the release of the iOS 26 developer beta 5, we saw more added features, like a new bouncy animation on the passcode screen and in the Control Center, MacRumors reports. Some or all of those changes will likely soon migrate into the separate public beta (see below). Most newer iPhone models are eligible to download iOS 26 (both the betas and final version). Want to see the full list of new features coming this fall? Read on. \nWhat is iOS 26?\nThe current iPhone operating system is iOS 18, and Apple is still actively updating it — version 18.6.1 was released to restore Apple Watch blood oxygen monitoring functionality for certain users in the US. More recently, Apple released 18.6.2 to address a vulnerability related to image processing. Apple has officially stopped signing iOS 18.6, MacRumors reports, which means it can no longer be installed on your iPhone due to a \"server-side software verification check.\" That's pretty normal when newer versions are available to download.\nBut don't expect to see iOS 19 soon — or ever. Instead, Apple is skipping the numbering ahead to iOS 26 next month. The company has decided to line up its iOS version numbers with a year-based system, similar to car model years. So while iOS and its sibling operating systems will be released in late 2025, they're all designated \"26\" to reflect the year ahead. \nIt's official, we're moving to iOS 26. (Apple)\nWhat is Liquid Glass design?\nLet's be honest. Out of everything announced at WWDC this year, the new Liquid Glass design was the star of the show. The iPhone's home and lock screens have looked pretty much the same year after year — the last exciting thing (in my opinion) was the option to add your own aesthetic to your home screen by customizing your apps and widgets. So seeing the home and lock screens' new facelift is refreshing.\nSo what exactly is Liquid Glass? Apple calls it a \"new translucent material\" since, well, the apps and widgets are clear. However, the screen can still adapt to dark and light modes, depending on surroundings. You'll also notice buttons with a new floating design in several apps, like Phone and Maps. They're designed to be less distracting than the current buttons, but are still easy to see. While the design overhaul has proven to be controversial since its announcement, some — including Engadget's own Devindra Hardawar — like the new direction, even if it's somewhat reminiscent of Microsoft's translucent Windows Vista Aero designs from nearly twenty years ago.\nThat said, as of the release of the iOS 26 beta 2, Apple has already incorporated some user feedback into the design, dialing back the transparency in at least some places. And while it will continue to evolve, Apple users won't be able to escape it: Liquid Glass was designed to make all of Apple's OSes more cohesive. Here's a look at how the translucent aesthetic will look with the new macOS Tahoe 26 on your desktop.\nWhat are the new and notable features of iOS 26?\niOS 26 has a laundry list of new features. Among the most worthwhile:\nPhone app redesign: You'll finally be able to scroll through contacts, recent calls and voicemail messages all on one screen. It also comes with a new feature called Hold Assist that'll notify you when an agent comes to the phone so you can avoid the elevator music and continue on with other tasks.\nLive Translation in Phone, FaceTime and Messages: iOS 26 is bringing the ability to have a conversation via phone call or text message with someone who speaks another language. Live Translation will translate your conversation in real time, which results in some stop-and-go interactions in the examples Apple shared during its presentation.\nPolls in group chats: Tired of sorting through what seems like hundreds of messages in your group chat? You and your friends will soon be able to create polls in group messages for deciding things like which brunch spot you're eating at or whose car you're taking on a road trip.\nFiltering unknown senders in Messages: If you haven't received spam texts about unpaid tolls or other citations, you're lucky. For those of us who have, those annoying messages will soon be filtered away in a separate folder.\nVisual Intelligence: Similar to a reverse Google image search, this new feature will allow you to search for anything that's on your iPhone screen. For instance, if you spot a pair of shoes someone is wearing in an Instagram photo, you can screenshot it and use Visual Intelligence to find those shoes (or similar ones) online.\nPhotos tabs are back: For anyone who's still frustrated with the Photos changes made last year, you'll be happy to know that your tabs are coming back. Library and Collections will have their own separate spaces so you don't have to scroll to infinity to find what you're looking for.\nFaceTime \"Communication Safety\" feature: A newer addition to iOS 26 appears to be the FaceTime \"Communication Safety\" feature that pauses communications if and when nudity is detected. The feature appears to be a child safety feature that uses on-device detection, thus obviating any cloud-based privacy issues. \nNew lock screen options: The iPhone lock screen gets more customizable in iOS 26, with a cooler clock, 3D wallpaper effects, more widgets and better focus mode options. \nApple's Hold Assist will be nifty for those pesky services that put you on hold for 10 or more minutes. (Apple)\nNew changes coming to iPadOS 26\nYour iPad isn't getting left behind when it comes to big updates. Here's what's coming this fall.\nMultitasking and real windowing: When you download the newest update, you'll be able to have multiple apps running on your screen at the same time. Once you open an app, it'll appear on your screen as normal but you'll be able to resize and move it across your screen to make room for other apps. This feature is optional so you can turn it off if you don't like it.\nVisual update: Along with the other new OSes, iPadOS 26 is coming with the Liquid Glass aesthetic. This new look will appear on the lock and home screens, as well as the drop-down menus.\nNew menu bar: When you swipe down on your screen, the new menu bar will appear with options like File, Edit, Windows and more. There's also a search option if you're looking for something specific.\nCheck out our first impressions of iPadOS 26. \nWhat about AirPods?\nAirPods are also getting updated with iOS 26. Here are some of the more notable functions.\nEnhanced audio recording: Apple calls this \"studio-quality\" audio recording, and with it, you'll notice more clarity while in noisy environments.\nCamera remote control: Using this, you can take a photo or start and stop video recording with just one press on your AirPods. When taking photos, you'll get a three-second countdown before your iPhone or iPad snaps the picture.\nLive translation feature: While not officially announced or confirmed, it appears that the long-rumored live translation for AirPods could be coming with iOS 26. The evidence comes from a system asset spotted in the in iOS 26 beta showing a gesture that's triggered by pressing both earbud stems at the same time. The photo also shows words in several different languages. \nHeart rate monitoring (rumored for now): Bloomberg's Mark Gurman believes Apple will introduce new AirPods Pro earbuds this year, which could have heart rate monitoring. It would work with Apple's Health app and other fitness apps that track heart rates.\nWhich iPhones will be able to upgrade to iOS 26?\nA few iPhone models that run the current version of iOS — iPhone XR, XS and XS Max — won't be compatible with the latest upgrade. But any iPhones released in 2019 or later will be eligible for the iOS 26 update.\n\niPhone SE (second generation or later)\niPhone 11\niPhone 11 Pro\niPhone 11 Pro Max\niPhone 12\niPhone 12 mini\niPhone 12 Pro\niPhone 12 Pro Max\niPhone 13\niPhone 13 mini\niPhone 13 Pro\niPhone 13 Pro Max\niPhone 14\niPhone 14 Plus\niPhone 14 Pro\niPhone 14 Pro Max\niPhone 15\niPhone 15 Plus\niPhone 15 Pro\niPhone 15 Pro Max\niPhone 16\niPhone 16 Plus\niPhone 16 Pro\niPhone 16 Pro Max\niPhone 16e\n\nNot listed here are the presumed new iPhone 17 models (or maybe iPhone 26?) that are all but certain to be announced and released in September. \nHow to install iOS 26 beta\nThe iOS 26 public beta is now available to download via the Apple Beta Software Program. If you're not already a member, you'll need to sign up to try out all the latest features. Just visit beta.apple.com and sign up with your phone number or email address. It's free.\nOnce you're in, you can install it by going to Settings > General > Software Update and selecting iOS 26 public beta. \nA word of caution: Don't sign up with your main iPhone unless you're OK with any risks that occur with using an OS that isn't finalized.\nWhen will the final version of iOS 26 be released?\niOS 26 will be released to the public this fall. It usually comes in September, within a week of the Apple iPhone event. Last year, it rolled out to iPhone users on September 16 — exactly one week after the iPhone 16 lineup was announced. Since the iPhone 17 event falls on September 9 this year, it's possible the downloads will hit our phones on September 16.\nIf you're more interested in the Apple Intelligence features coming, here's everything Apple revealed for iOS, macOS and more during WWDC. Also, check out how iOS 26 screenshots could be an intriguing preview of Apple's delayed Siri rework.\nUpdate, August 27: Added the official iPhone 17 event date, as well as the potential iOS 26 release.\nUpdate, August 25: Added a rumor about new AirPods Pro having heart rate monitoring.\nUpdate, August 22: Noted that Apple has officially stopped signing iOS 18.6.\nUpdate, August 20: Noted that iOS 26 public beta 4 and iOS 18.6.2 are now available to download.\nUpdate, August 18: Added details about a potential iOS 18.6 update.\nUpdate, August 15: Added to link to what to expect at the Apple iPhone event and details about what's available in the iOS 26 screenshots editor.\nUpdate, August 13: Added new AirPods detail spotted in the iOS 26 beta.\nUpdate, August 11: Noted that iOS 26 developer beta has hit beta 6. \nUpdate, August 8: Added new features coming with iPadOS 26 and AirPods.\nUpdate, August 6: Noted the release of iOS 26 beta 5 and the new bouncy feature on passcode screen and Control Center.\nUpdate, August 4: Noted that Apple is reportedly working on a ChatGPT rival.\nUpdate, August 1: Added quote from Tim Cook about iOS 26.\nUpdate, July 31: Noted that iOS 18.6 is now available. \nUpdate, July 24: Noted the iOS 26 public beta is now available.\nUpdate, July 3: Noted new FaceTime feature found in the developer beta.\nUpdate, June 30: Noted ongoing iOS 18 releases, and reports that Apple is considering additional external LLMs for Siri. \nUpdate, June 25: Noted changes added in iOS 26 beta 2. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/apple-ios-26-public-beta-5-is-live-here-are-all-the-new-iphone-features-coming-in-september-135749996.html?src=rss",
    "full_text": "So in just under two weeks, we'll get to take a first look at the new iPhone 17 lineup. If Apple keeps with tradition, expect to see iOS 26 available for download about one week after the event. Plus, a treasured feature that we took for granted is coming back (hint: it's in the Photos app). Some or all of those changes will likely soon migrate into the separate public beta (see below). So while iOS and its sibling operating systems will be released in late 2025, they're all designated \"26\" to reflect the year ahead. You'll also notice buttons with a new floating design in several apps, like Phone and Maps. Phone app redesign: You'll finally be able to scroll through contacts, recent calls and voicemail messages all on one screen.

    "summary": "It's official: The Apple iPhone 17 event will take place on Tuesday, September 9 at 1PM ET. That means we'll finally get to take a look at the much-anticipated iPhone 17 lineup — which will come equipped with the latest iOS 26 features preinstalled — and any new features Apple reveals that day. But since we still have to wait a couple of weeks until the iPhone event, we can only speculate what the new devices will look like. As with most unreleased iPhones, rumors and leaks have trickled in about the hardware side ahead of the official introduction. Here's what we're expecting and what we can reasonably assume we'll get from Apple in September.\nWhat are the latest iPhone 17 rumors?\nAfter the announcement dropped yesterday for the official iPhone 17 event, MacRumors speculates the Apple logo says a lot about the new iPhones. Apple's logo \"hints at two rumored iPhone 17 Pro features.\" \nThe logo shows bright orange and dark blue colors, rumored to be two of the iPhone 17 Pro colors, so they could be onto something. They also noticed it looks like an infrared heat map, hinting at the vapor chamber cooling system.\nGet ready for an awe dropping #AppleEvent on Tuesday, September 9! pic.twitter.com/uAcYp2RLMM— Tim Cook (@tim_cook) August 26, 2025\n\nThese rumors haven't been confirmed by Apple and we won't know what the actual iPhone 17 models will look like until the iPhone event next month. \nHow much will the iPhone 17 cost?\nApple's announced plan to expand US-based manufacturing partners seems to give it at least some shielding from the steepest Trump administration tariffs that have already triggered price increases on everything from PlayStations to Switch consoles to high-end cameras to Sonos speakers. But given that President Trump's trade policies can change from week to week, and Apple's continuing reliance on Asia-based supply chains, price shocks remain an ongoing possibility. The bigger question is: Will Apple absorb any higher costs, or pass them on to consumers? \nIf prices do creep up, Apple may choose to pair it with an \"upgrade.\" Consider this recent rumor posted by MacRumors from a leaker known as \"Instant Digital,\" suggesting that the default storage of the iPhone 17 line may start at 256GB, doubling the current 128GB baseline. While that could be accompanied by a price increase of $50, Apple could at least pitch it as a \"better value.\" That said, the company doubled the default RAM of its Mac computers from 8GB to 16GB at no extra cost in 2024 — but that was before the current Trump tariff cycle started.\nWhen will the iPhone 17 series be announced?\nMost years, the flagship smartphones are introduced in September. MacRumors highlighted a story originally reported by iphone-ticker.de that the Apple iPhone 17 event could be Tuesday, September 9, according to information gleaned from German mobile phone providers.\nIt's still too early to have the specific dates; some years, Apple only gives a week or two of lead time between sending invites and hosting the event. But years of past precedent show that sometime in September should be when the 17 models make their debut. This family of smartphones may be the last to follow that trend, however. There have been hints that the introduction of the iPhone 18 collection in 2026 will be split into a pro-tier announcement in the fall and a standard model announcement the following spring.\nWhat will the new iPhone 17 lineup include?\nDesign leaks suggest that Apple is building an ultra-thin smartphone, likely to be named the iPhone 17 Air to match Apple's ultralight laptop designation. Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, often a solid source of advanced intel about Apple, reported in January that the iPhone 17 Air will be equipped with a basic A19 chip and will only have a single camera lens. It may also use Apple's new in-house modem, which was introduced in February on the iPhone 16e. More details about this development may leak ahead of September, but that's what we know for now.\nAn investor note from Apple analyst Jeff Pu indicated that the Air will have a titanium frame. If his reports are accurate, the lightweight smartphone will be the only entry in the iPhone 17 lineup to use that metal; the iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone 17 Pro Max are expected to be made of aluminum, which is oddly a lighter material than titanium. Other speculation had suggested that the Air would use a blend of aluminum and titanium, so the exact materials may not be known until the official announcement.\nAdditionally, an August 4 MacRumors report says the internal battery pack of the iPhone Air is just 2.49mm thick — half the thickness of the iPhone 17 Pro battery. The leak was posted on the Korean-language Naver blog, where they show the alleged batteries of the iPhone 17 Air and 17 Pro side by side. The same account claimed the 17 Air's battery capacity was a mere 2,800 mAh, MacRumors notes. (That's below the battery capacity of current iPhone 16 models.)\nOn a similar topic, an iPhone 17 Pro production leak appears to have revealed an all-aluminum chassis, according to MacRumors. Originally posted by leaker Majin Bu, the image shows a shell that has a large round hole on the back (where the Apple logo typically is) to allow for MagSafe charging. MacRumors says this could just be a molding but notes that the aluminum frame (versus the current titanium in Pro iPhone models) would yield a significantly lower weight.\nThat same leaker (Majin Bu), whom MacRumors classifies as a \"hit-or-miss leaker,\" suggests the iPhone 17 Pro will have better wireless signal strength thanks to an updated antenna design. The individual posted a render on X that shows a new antenna system that wraps around the iPhone 17 Pro's supposedly wider rear camera bump. Again, this is a render, not a real-world photo. That said, we can't knock the goal of better wireless reception, so we're hoping this one has a degree of truth to it.\nLeaker Majin Bu also claims \"TechWoven\" cases could be introduced, per a MacRumors report. The cases match the rumored design on the iPhone 17 models, with the wide camera bump. The leaker noted there are two lanyard holes for \"convenient and secure carrying,\" so it could be worn around your neck. The colors would come in grey/black, blue, green, purple and orange. Additionally, he says there will be new Liquid Silicone cases in eight colors, including Deep Orange, Pale Orange, Grass Green, Celadon, Fog Purple, Grey Blue, Dark Blue and Midnight Black. \nEach new roster includes a base model, but over the years, Apple has shaken up the variety of phones it offers. Most likely there will be an iPhone 17 and an iPhone 17 Pro. Apple has also committed to the size matters philosophy, and has been building an iPhone Pro Max option with an even bigger screen and better battery life; the 17 roster will almost certainly have one as well. \nThe new Pro iPhones are said to have a full-width \"camera island\" on the rear, which would mark the first time an Apple model opted for that design. This feature can be seen in the purported iPhone 17 \"spotted in the wild.\" The pics, highlighted on MacRumors, show a black cased iPhone (17 Pro?) with the distinct back panel. Is it the real deal? The dual angles lend a degree of credibility in a social media landscape increasingly polluted with AI-enhanced fakes, but your guess is as good as ours.\nI just spotted a test development iPhone in the wild 🤩🤩🤩 pic.twitter.com/iS3PtKWqxJ— Fox Pupy 🦊🧡 (@Skyfops) July 28, 2025\n\nThe iPhone 17 Air seems primed to take the place of a potential iPhone 17 Plus. Since the iPhone 16e was only just introduced in February at a surprisingly high price point, it seems unlikely that there will be a new addition to that lower end of the spectrum, the models that were previously called SE. \nAt the very least, it sounds like the iPhone 17 Air won't take away the charging port and rely only on wireless connectivity. Bloomberg said that while Apple had investigated making the iPhone 17 Air without a single port, the company (fortunately) changed plans. He also says that the rumored phone will have a 6.6-inch screen and include the Dynamic Island and Camera Control button. Finally, the price is rumored at $900 — likely more than the standard iPhone 17 but less than the Pro.\nWe've also gotten what seems to be a reliable look at what the color lineup will be for the new smartphones. Macworld reported that the iPhone 17 will be available in black, white, steel gray, green, purple and light blue. The iPhone 17 Air will reportedly have four color options: black, white, light blue and light gold. While the Air colors will be less saturated, the visuals for the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max will go bold. The options for the Pro models are expected to be black, white, gray, dark blue and orange.\nBloomberg's Mark Gurman believes there actually will be a new orange color offered for the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max, as well as a light blue color for the iPhone 17 Air, he confirmed in his weekly Power On newsletter.\nOn July 30, Tom's Guide highlighted an X post from Sonny Dickson — a longtime and generally reliable leaker of unreleased iPhone information — showing \"dummy\" iPhone 17 models in the new colors that were the source of the aforementioned Macworld story. While these are literally just mock-ups — not real, leaked iPhones — it's interesting to see how the design and color rumors translate into a real-world look and feel.\nTo add the the rumors, a Weibo leaker known as Digital Chat Station suggests the iPhone 17e will come equipped with a new design that includes the Dynamic Island, MacRumors reports. According to the post, the new phone will have the A19 chip and could have a 6.1-inch OLED display with a front-facing 12-megapixel camera and a rear-facing 48-megapixel camera. However, it's important to note this report refers to the 17e model that would be expected to launch no earlier than February 2026, if it followed the same release pattern as the iPhone 16e.\nWhat will iOS 26 be like?\nApple upended its numbering conventions with WWDC 2025, and will match the name of each new operating system to the year it's released. So when the next wave of iPhones hits, they'll be running on iOS 26.\nOn the design side, the smartphone OS introduced during the big developer showcase took a contentious approach dubbed Liquid Glass. Apple has been scaling down the amount of transparency effects in the subsequent beta tests of iOS 26, but it will still have a glass-like visual.\nThe feature list includes big and small updates. On the more impactful side, the Phone and Photos apps have been redesigned. There will be several features leveraging artificial intelligence, such as live translation capabilities coming to Phone, FaceTime and Messages. Apple is also currently testing a sensitive content warning for child accounts that will freeze FaceTime video if nudity is detected by on-device machine learning tools. And the company is also launching Visual Intelligence, which will use AI to search for elements in an image.\niOS 26 also has a litany of minor, quality of life improvements. Group texts are getting support for polls. And for the slow risers out there, iOS 26 will finally let you escape the tyranny of the nine minute snooze alarm. \nThe next iOS is now available as a public beta. Here are our initial impressions of the Liquid Glass design and other new features. iOS 26 is compatible with all models back through iPhone 11.\nWhat other products are expected to be released alongside the iPhone 17?\nIf Apple follows its usual pattern, the iPhone 17 will be announced alongside new Apple Watch products. That would be the Apple Watch Series 11 (if Apple sticks to the same naming scheme), and maybe an Apple Watch Ultra 3 and/or an updated Apple Watch SE. (They'll all run watchOS 26, of course.) Other possibilities — and this is, again, speculation — could include refreshed Apple AirPods Pro (which received its last big update in 2022) and maybe new AirTags trackers (first released in 2021).\nThe Apple rumor mill got a big shot in the arm this week thanks to the reported inclusion of product ID numbers in recent beta software builds. Per MacRumors, it's a laundry list of new hardware, including long-rumored product updates like the Apple TV, HomePod mini, new Apple Studio Display monitor and two fresh iPads. \nOf course, even if that list is totally accurate, we may not see those products until 2026 — if ever. So don't expect all of products to share the stage with the iPhone 17, especially since Apple likes to keep its star performer at the center of attention. \nThat said, keep in mind that Apple has recently been having Mac-centric announcements in late October (as it did last year to debut new M4 Macs), so there's always the chance of another shoe dropping a few weeks down the road.  \nUpdate, August 27, 2025, 5:44PM ET: Added official Apple iPhone 17 event date, and a rumor about its event logo.\nUpdate, August 25, 2025, 5:15PM ET: Added new reports about the iPhone 17 Pro's orange color as well as new rumored Liquid Silicone cases.\nUpdate, August 22, 2025, 11:52AM ET: Added new details about the colors of the rumored TechWoven case.\nUpdate, August 20, 2025, 7:12PM ET: Added new rumor about potential TechWoven case for iPhone 17 series.\nUpdate, August 18, 2025, 6:23PM ET: Added new rumor about the iPhone 17e potentially having the Dynamic Island.\nUpdate, August 15, 2025, 2:05PM ET: Added new rumor about the all-aluminum chassis on the iPhone 17.\nUpdate, August 13, 2025, 10:02PM ET: Added a list of the products that are expected to be released alongside the iPhone 17s. \nUpdate, August 11, 2025, 7:27PM ET: Added a render of a rumored new antenna design for the iPhone 17 Pro.\nUpdate, August 8, 2025, 4:43PM ET: Added new speculation and reports about iPhone 17 pricing.\nUpdate, August 6, 2025, 4:05PM ET: Added latest details about the potential iPhone 17 event date.\nUpdate, August 4, 2025, 5:23PM ET: Added latest battery leaks about the iPhone 17 models.\nUpdate, August 1, 2025, 8:15AM ET: Added new photos showing potential iPhone 17 colors.\nUpdate, July 30, 2025, 11:08AM ET: Added latest leaks and rumors about the iPhone 17, and updated information on the iOS 26 public beta.\nUpdate, July 17, 2025, 4:40PM ET: Added latest information about iOS 26, possible materials for the Air, and the color options for the different models.\nUpdate, March 17, 2025, 2PM ET: Added details about the rumored price and features of the iPhone 17 Air.\nUpdate, April 11, 2025, 3:45PM ET: Added details from Front Page Tech's new video that claims to reveal details from a leaked iOS 19 build.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/the-iphone-17-event-is-september-9-heres-everything-to-know-about-the-upcoming-apple-lineup-153024127.html?src=rss",

In the filing, their lawyers argue that Ofcom is overreaching its legal authority by trying to apply British law to companies based in the U.S., where their behavior is protected by the U.S. Constitution and the American legal code, and seek to have a U.S. federal judge declare that Ofcom has no jurisdiction in this matter. “American citizens do not surrender our constitutional rights just because Ofcom sends us an e-mail,” Byrne said in a statement to reporters. The OSA’s requirements have drawn international backlash, as it’s not clear whether sites like Reddit, Bluesky and Wikipedia would be subjected to the same penalties. The Trump administration has taken a far more aggressive approach in favor of MAGA internet, reportedly threatening countries with higher tariffs unless they roll back online safety laws. In one case, they’ve followed through: last month, Trump issued an executive order raising some tariffs on Brazil by 40%, citing the country’s legal action against Rumble and Truth Social. Byrne, who once represented the right-wing social network Parler, previously told The Verge that he’d believed that the Trump administration had tried working diplomatic backchannels in order to get Ofcom to back down. Though there’s no indication that the State Department has intervened, Byrne said that lawyers representing other websites facing similar issues with Ofcom were watching them closely: should 4Chan and Kiwi Farms, of all places, receive legal protection, it would stand to reason that they should, too. “I’m not going to go into details,” he said, “but suffice to say, there are plenty of lawyers interested in taking on Ofcom right now.”"

While the details and timeframe are currently unknown, it's likely that if shipping from these countries resumes, it will be at significantly higher duties and related taxes, which US businesses may pass down to consumers as higher retail prices. Until then, several overseas sellers are expected to stop taking orders from US buyers altogether. Small consumer-oriented packages can still be sent through most services, depending on the specific value and related rules that shipping companies currently have. However, businesses that trade in international goods -- including online shops on eBay and Etsy -- currently have little recourse except to rely on current stock, find other suppliers or wait for the situation to be resolved.

The next step is translating Flight 10 data into future hardware upgrades to move closer to routine operations and days when, as Musk envisioned, “Starship launches more than 24 times in 24 hours.”"

FBI assistant director Brett Leatherman told The Washington Post that the hackers, dubbed Salt Typhoon, also broke into companies in 80 countries, revealing for the first time the global scale of the Chinese spying campaign. Leatherman didn’t name the hacked companies. AT&T, Verizon, and Lumen were previously confirmed as breached, and Charter Communications and Windstream were later named as victims, among others. The hackers targeted call records among senior American politicians and officials, allowing them to map out who was calling who, and on whom the U.S. was snooping with legal orders. For a time, the threat was so severe that the FBI urged Americans to switch to encrypted messaging apps to avoid having their calls and messages accessed. The FBI, along with nearly two dozen international agencies, said in an advisory [PDF] published Wednesday that Salt Typhoon primarily targets company routers and siphons sensitive network traffic, and offered technical guidance on how to identify intrusions. Leatherman told the Post that the threat from China is “ongoing.”"

Anyone else would have to pay $80 for the entire game with the extra story mode and upgraded graphics, which feels like an awful lot for a game that isn't even new. It was a blast to play with my Kirby-loving 12-year-old. The new stages are basically altered versions of existing levels throughout the game, which play differently with new paths, secrets and \"Starry\" fragments you have to uncover. There are a few new transforming shapes Kirby can suck up this time (Mouthful Mode, which is different from the standard enemy-power-absorbing abilities Kirby normally has, in case you've never played this game before). Just be ready for a pleasant bonus extension rather than a whole new sprawling game, mainly so you'll keep your expectations in check. There's a ton of territory Nintendo can mine for future upgrades to the Switch library. Forgotten Land follows the best template so far in bundling graphics and DLC extras, but I want even more."

    "summary": "Choosing the best Android phone can feel overwhelming as there are so many options from so many brands, it’s hard to know where to start. Unlike Apple, which sticks to its sleek lineup of iPhones, Android offers a world of variety. Whether you're eyeing the latest flagship from Samsung, a budget-friendly smartphone from Motorola or something unique with a foldable design, there’s an Android device out there to suit your needs.The beauty of Android is its flexibility. You’ll find phones with different screen sizes, camera setups, battery life and even quirky extras like stylus support or rugged builds. Plus, Android lets you customize your device to your heart's content – something Apple fans might envy. We’ve tested and researched the top Android phones to help you find the right one for your budget, lifestyle, and tech preferences.\nBest Android phones for 2025\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhat to look for in a new Android phone\nPerformance\nWhen it comes to picking our favorite Android phones, the main things we look for are pretty straightforward: good performance (both compute and AI), a nice display, solid design, sharp cameras, long battery life and a significant commitment to ongoing software support. For performance, not only do we look at benchmarks and other metrics, but we also evaluate phones based on responsiveness. Regardless of whether you’re reading, text messaging, scrolling through social media or playing a game, no one wants a gadget that feels sluggish. \nDisplay\n\n\n\n\nWhen it comes to displays, we generally prefer OLED panels that can produce rich, saturated colors with at least 600 nits of brightness, though many of our top mid-range and high-end phones can hit 1,000 nits or more. And more recently, most of our favorite devices also support screens with fast refresh rates of 90Hz or 120Hz, which adds an extra level of smoothness and fluidity.\nDesign\nNow we will admit there is a bit of subjectivity when deciding which phones look the best, but there are other design aspects like dust and water resistance or screen durability that can make a big difference to long-term survival. It’s also important to consider things like support for wireless charging, power sharing (aka reverse wireless charging) and UWB connectivity, which can have an impact on how your phone interacts with your other devices.\nCameras\nObviously, for photos we’re looking for sharp, colorful shots in both bright and low-light conditions. And we want video clips with high dynamic range, rich audio and smooth image stabilization. Extra cameras for ultra-wide and telephoto lenses are a plus. The best cameras should also include features like dedicated night modes, support for various video recording resolutions, and additional photo modes like timelapse, slow motion and more.\nBattery and software\nFinally, in terms of longevity, we’re looking for all-day battery life on devices that also delivered great results on our local video rundown test (at least 16 hours on a charge, but more is obviously better). Wireless charging capabilities have become almost ubiquitous over the past few years, and most of our top picks have this extra perk. Fast-charging is available on some Android phones, too. Finally, with people holding onto their phones longer than ever, we like to see companies commit to at least three years of software support, upgrades and regular security updates.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/best-android-phone-130030805.html?src=rss",

It sports a 6.8-inch OLED display with an incredible peak brightness of up to 4,500 nits. But the best part is that starting at $900, it costs less than an equivalent Galaxy S25+ too.

The Environmental Protection Agency placed 144 workers on administrative leave after they penned a letter to EPA administrator Lee Zeldin saying, “EPA under your leadership will not protect communities from hazardous chemicals and unsafe drinking water, but instead will increase risks to public health and safety.”"

    "full_text": "Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater seemed to be designed specifically for me, at first. The only entry that I never managed to play was Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater. This makes sense from a story perspective, but it left me feeling as though I was playing with one hand tied behind my back. Despite its incredible visuals, this is not an overhaul to the extent of recent remakes like Resident Evil 4 or Silent Hill 2. I have no problem learning a game’s systems through trial and error, especially when loading is lightning fast (the PS5’s SSD has no doubt saved many a potential broken controller). It was also lovely to hear Snake’s English voice being performed by series original David Hayter, whose over-the-top action hero growling once again works perfectly. Another area required me to sneak into a base, but it was surrounded by an electric fence and landmines, which proved impossible to spot because I had missed out on a landmine detector earlier in the game. The gorgeous visuals and eccentric story make it appear like a perfect fit for me. But Delta left me feeling frustrated in its (deliberately designed) helplessness and old-school structure. It left me wanting to be anywhere else rather than in the jungles with that beloved weirdo Snake."

    "full_text": "In Brief Elon Musk’s The Boring Company is finally testing Full Self-Driving (Supervised), the advanced driver assistance system created by Tesla, in the tunnels that connect Las Vegas’ Convention Center to a few nearby hotels, according to Fortune. Steve Hill, the CEO of the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority, told the outlet that The Boring Company has been doing tests of the software for a few months now in Tesla vehicles with only safety drivers onboard. But any widespread use of the tech is still “a ways off,” Hill said. The Tesla tunnels have been open for around four years, and while The Boring Company has plans to expand them across Las Vegas, they currently serve a small area underneath and around the Convention Center. Despite Tesla’s recent launch of a small-scale, invite-only robotaxi service in Austin, Texas (and a similarly small ride-hail service in San Francisco), and Musk’s boasting about how good the technology is, Hill said that safety drivers still have to “periodically” intervene and take control of the vehicles. In theory, the simple tunnels should be an easy task for Tesla’s autonomy software to solve, with perhaps the greatest challenge being navigating passenger pick-up and drop-off at the various underground stations. Hill said the colorful lighting of The Boring Company’s tunnels, along with the semi-smooth rock walls, have been challenges that the driver assistance system has had to cope with as the cars “find spots that are difficult for them.”"

An early Labor Day deal has dropped its price to around $328.99 ($121 off) at Amazon, Walmart, and from Brisk It. The Zelos-450 has 450 square inches of cooking space, and can reach up to 500 degrees Fahrenheit, though you’ll mostly be cooking at temperatures well below the maximum when smoking. The smoker took about an hour (and two people) to fully assemble, including setting up an account in the Brisk It mobile app, and connecting Zelos-450 to my Wi-Fi network. Wi-Fi connectivity allows you to ignite and shut down the smoker or adjust its temperature mid-cook from your smartphone. It also allows you to access Brisk It’s Vera AI, an optional virtual assistant that can create recipes and manage your cooks automatically based on voice and text prompts or a photo. At minimum I recommend turning on app notifications to get an alert when the smoker has reached your desired temperature. The smoker comes with a meat probe, so I could quickly check the internal temperature of larger cuts from my phone and get an alert when they were done. Cooking on the Zelos-450 requires time and patience (upwards of 18 hours for brisket). I highly recommend picking up Brisk-It’s Waterproof Smoker Cover."

    "summary": "Google marked the tenth generation of Pixels with four new smartphones. While the ‘pro’ and foldable Pixel 10 models might have no-compromise specs (and prices to match), Google has blurred the lines between its entry-level Pixel 10 and those premium devices. This year, the base Pixel 10 has a bigger battery, a new 5x zoom telephoto camera and almost as many AI features as the flagship Pixel 10 Pro and Pixel 10 Pro Fold.\nIf the celebrity-loaded Made By Google event was anything to go by, the company is putting a lot more effort (and money) into making the Pixel a genuine threat to the Galaxy S series and iPhones, and conveying that message to everyone. The Pixel 10 deserves those comparisons, and in a lot of ways, it’s the better smartphone. \n \nHardware and display\nGoogle’s 10th-generation of Pixels look a lot like their predecessors. There’s a protruding pill-shaped camera unit, which is the central design flourish. It’s substantial, which still looks a little jarring, but it also doubles as a sort of grip for my index finger while holding the phone, something I noticed after a year of using the Pixel 9 Pro. Google has also refreshed the color range of its Pixel family. Both a vivid blue (Indigo) and mild yellow (Lemongrass) shades are welcome additions to the typical black and white hues.\nThe 6.3-inch screen’s refresh rate still tops out at 120Hz, but that’s now pretty much standard across midrange devices and up. Even the entry-level Pixel 9a has the same smooth scrolling experience. However, Google has boosted the Pixel 10’s brightness, now peaking at 3,000 nits, which is a slight increase from 2,700 nits on the Pixel 9. The screen maxes out at 2,000 nits at its brightest setting for HDR, which is also a bump up from the Pixel 9. Google has also boosted the sound quality on the Pixel 10 to be noticeably less tinny and a little bassier than previous Pixels.\nAnother addition is Pixelsnap, which is essentially MagSafe for Pixels. The wireless charging integration is largely the same, with magnets that firmly attach the device to charging pucks, accessories and docks. It easily worked with a range of wireless chargers, although Qi2-supported options are still rarer than they should be. You’re more likely to find a MagSafe-branded wireless charger from third-party companies like Belkin, but those don’t achieve the faster charge speeds of Qi2.\nIf you’re feeling spendy, Google’s official Pixelsnap charger is $40 (or $70 with a stand) and reaches speeds up to 25W, while there’s a PopSocket-like Pixel ring stand that can snap to the back of the phone. Note that the Pixel 10 can only wirelessly charge up to 15W, though. Additionally, the Pixel 10 series supports most of the MagSafe peripherals that iPhone users have been enjoying since 2020.\nCamera\n\n\n\n\nThe big hardware upgrade this year is the cameras. The photo unit includes a 48-megapixel wide-angle setup, a 13MP sensor with an ultra-wide lens and a 10.8MP 5x telephoto camera. For a base phone, it’s an impressive combo, even though it doesn’t quite match the higher-res sensors found in the Pixel 10 Pro — or last year’s Pixel 9 Pro.\n\n\n\n\nThat new telephoto lens isn’t some middling 2x or 3x zoom, but a 5x zoom which puts it beyond rivals at a similar price point, like the Galaxy S25 (3x zoom). The iPhone 16 doesn't even have a telephoto lens and makes do with an \"optical-quality\" digital zoom. It’s like using a Pixel Pro, with an additional cropped zoom up to 10x and a (less consistent) Super Res Zoom up to 20x. This is a significant step up for the base model and something I’m sure we’ll see the aforementioned rivals likely try to match. Simply put, the Pixel 10 is just a better, more versatile camera phone than, say, the Galaxy S25.\n\n\n\n\nI tested the Pixel 10’s telephoto against the 9 Pro’s, and there were noticeable differences in detail and crispness, which is understandable as the latter has a much higher-res 48MP sensor. However, that doesn’t detract from the leap in both detail and shooting range compared to the base Pixel 9 from last year.\nThe Pixel 10 can also capture 10-bit HDR video now, although it doesn’t offer the Pixel 10 Pro’s 8K video, Night Sight Video and Super Res Zoom Video options. There’s no Video Boost, either, which uploads footage to Google’s cloud to enhance online.\n\n\n\n\nThere are plenty of other notable camera features onboard, including Night Sight low-light shooting, or Add Me, which is still the standout Pixel camera feature from last year and hasn’t been replicated by rivals yet. For those who missed my praise last year, Add Me stitches together two group photos, taken by two different people. The mode guides users to line up the shots, meaning your group photos can finally include the person who takes all of them (me).\nCamera Coach is an intriguing addition to the Pixel camera experience. Above the viewfinder, there’s a new camera icon with a plus sign in the top right corner. Tapping it makes the screen flash, and the coach will offer multiple framing and photo-taking suggestions. It’ll also add a Get Inspired option that goes a bit more avant-garde, generating thumbnails of possible results based off of the sample it took, filling the gaps with generative AI.\nI witheringly launched the Coach, ready to criticize its basic suggestions or common-sense ideas. But, you know what, it’s not bad. With hooks in Gemini AI, the mode will offer angle, lighting and composition suggestions. You can also choose whether to emphasize, say, the pattern of some leaves, or the background behind it or the group of people to the side. While the feature utilizes Google’s Tensor G5 chip to analyze shots, it does require an internet connection.\nSoftware\n\n\n\n\nThanks to the Tensor G5 chip, the Pixel 10 can run Google’s newest Gemini Nano model on-device. This means generative AI experiences can now be used without the need for connectivity. However, as I mentioned with Camera Coach, that isn’t always the case.\nHowever, Magic Cue does work without having to summon its answers from the cloud. And when it works, it’s what I’ve wanted from AI assistants for years. After gaining your permission, Gemini gets into your screenshots, calendar, Gmail accounts and more. Magic Cue will pull in the information you need, hopefully, where you need it. For example, it displays the email address for that comedy show venue your friend wants tickets for, or nudges your calendar to show availability when a friend asks what your weekend plans are. These cues are highlighted with a rainbow “aura” that has become the de facto visual shorthand for artificial intelligence. This is just the start: Google will eventually add the ability for Magic Cue to tap into your photos, suggesting images when someone’s mentioned in text messages, emails and more.\nMagic Cue has some blind spots, though. As my colleague Sam Rutherford noted in his Pixel 10 Pro review, I found it particularly fussy with calendar cues, often failing to identify dates or times in screenshots or emails. It’s also missing a major area of where I want all of this info: third-party messaging apps. But hey, if you’re using Google Messages, you’re good to go.\nGoogle’s almost-instantaneous voice translation during calls is impressive too. Managing Editor Cherlynn Low laid out how that works, and while it’s a technical marvel, I’m not sure how much I’d use the feature for high-stakes conversations like booking accommodations or sorting out travel issues.\nI also liked Take a Message, which transcribes calls when you’re unable to answer. However, just like I did while I was testing Apple’s similar feature during my iOS 26 preview, I either answered calls instinctively [Ed. note: Mat is clearly a different specimen from the rest of us humans] or people didn’t leave voicemails.\nThere are plenty of minor upgrades to existing tools and features on the Pixel 10. Gemini Live, which can “see” through your camera or read what’s on screen, can also now offer visual guidance, highlighting objects onscreen after hearing your request or question. NotebookLM now integrates with Pixel Screenshots and Recorder. If the former detects something that could be useful to an existing NotebookLM project, it’ll suggest adding it for easier access.\nThere are also Writing Tools (sound familiar?) within Gboard, which can retool your existing prose into specified writing styles. It’ll even suggest which emojis to add into the mix. For now, this is only compatible with US English, so it’s not my favourite favorite. There’s also a new Pixel Journal app, which sounds pretty familiar too. I briefly tested it out during the days I’ve had the phone, but if you haven’t found the app/notebook/diary to journal in yet, it’s a perfectly fine option, with AI-powered suggestions on what to write about and the ability to attach photos and other details that your smartphone can log. Something that wasn’t apparent during my review was that the Journal app will learn about your writing patterns and offer up insights on how often you write, when you typically write and more.\nPerformance and battery life\n\n\n\n\nGoogle says its new Tensor G5 chip is 34 percent faster than last year’s G4, while the TPU (Tensor Processing Unit, ugh) is 60 percent faster at AI tasks. Performance testing apps like Geekbench 6 can’t be installed on Pixel devices before the phones go on sale, so I wasn’t able to quantify the upgrade. I can feel those improvements with heavier processing tasks though, like transcription, translation and image generation, in apps like Pixel Studio. The Pixel 10 also had no issues running graphically intensive games like Infinity Nikki and Zenless Zone Zero, and seemed quicker to load most apps compared to Pixel phones of the past. Google’s Tensor chips are definitely catching up.\nAnecdotally, I find myself using Google’s Pixel AI features (and Gemini) significantly more often than on other Android devices I’ve used and tested. With comparable AI tasks, such as transcribing an interview, the Tensor G5 appears to handle them more efficiently, delivering results in less time.\nThe Pixel 10 has a 4,970mAh battery, which is not only bigger than the Pixel 9 (4,700mAh) but also the Pixel 10 Pro (4,870mAh). However, the Pixel 10 doesn’t quite match the 27 hours-plus rundown time of the Pixel 9. Running a looping video, this year’s phone lasted around 22 hours, which is a bit disappointing given the specs. I’ll retest and update this review if the results differ.\nThe Pixel 10 supports wired charging up to 30W, returning to over 50 percent in under 30 minutes. It can also be wirelessly charged at up to 15W, thanks to Qi2 support. That’s an improvement, but it’s not Qi2.2 like the Pixel 10 Pro XL, which can reach 25W charging wirelessly.\nWrap-up\n\n\n\n\nThe Pixel 10 redefines what we should expect from base flagship smartphones. With Apple’s next iPhone just around the corner, Google has added a 5x telephoto camera, rounding out the Pixel’s photography chops offering while augmenting it with more features powered by Gemini. Camera Coach might not be for everyone, but Magic Cue — like Pixel Screenshots last year — is a glimpse into the future of how we’ll use AI on smartphones.\nThe Pixel 10 is a substantial upgrade from the Pixel 9, although given it has the Tensor G5 chip, it’s a shame that software features like Zoom Enhance from last year’s Pixels didn’t make the cut. Unless you’re a die-hard smartphone gamer, there isn’t a more capable smartphone at this price.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/google-pixel-10-review-170041718.html?src=rss",

Under the hood there’s a tangibly more powerful processor and a bigger battery, while Qi2 support with Pixelsnap means the Pixel 10 works with tripods, wireless charging docks and other accessories made for iPhones. It easily worked with a range of wireless chargers, although Qi2-supported options are still rarer than they should be. The iPhone 16 doesn't even have a telephoto lens and makes do with an \"optical-quality\" digital zoom.

    "summary": "In the ‘90s, the term “smartphone” emerged to denote devices with “advanced computing” features that allowed you to do more than just make calls. But if we’re being honest, applying that label to pocket-sized gadgets that ran cut-down versions of desktop PC apps with half-baked UIs was kind of overselling it. More recently though, we’ve seen handsets like those from Google come with sophisticated features that simply aren’t available anywhere else, due in no small part to the rise of AI. And now with the arrival of the Pixel 10 Pro and Pixel 10 Pro XL, these devices feel like they are redefining the “smart” in smartphone as we know it.\n \nDesign and display: Bringing the polish\nThe overall look and feel of the Pixel 10 Pro and Pro XL haven’t changed much since last year. You still get polished aluminum sides sandwiched by slabs of Gorilla Glass Victus 2 and an IP68 rating for dust and water resistance. The main differences are a slightly updated lineup of colors (moonstone, jade, porcelain and obsidian) and a switch from a matte to shiny finish on the back. This is a small bummer for me as I prefer the soft-touch feel of its predecessors. The pale gold frame on the jade model is a nice touch, even if I would have preferred a richer shade of green. \nThe Pixel 10 Pro and Pro XL’s 120Hz OLED screens have gotten a touch brighter, now topping out at 3,300 nits (up from 3,000). This makes them a bit easier to see outside in direct sunlight while retaining the gorgeous vivid colors we’ve enjoyed on Google’s phones since switching to its Super Actua-branded displays. And with the screens themselves coming in at 6.3- and 6.8-inches, there’s no deviation in sizing either.\n\n\n\n\n   Sam Rutherford for Engadget \n \n\nMy one small gripe is that at least in the US, the Pixel 10 family is now eSIM-only. As someone who prefers the convenience of being able to swap mobile networks at a moment’s notice, I really wish Google hadn’t. But ever since Apple made a similar switch back on the iPhone 14, this was bound to happen at some point. Like microSD card expandability and 3.5mm audio, physical sims have become another endangered feature on the brink of extinction.\nPerformance: The Tensor G5 is faster but not quite peak\nWith Google’s focus on AI performance, the everyday speed of its phones has always lagged a touch behind other Android flagships. However, thanks to the Tensor G5, the Pixel 10 line has closed that gap considerably due to CPUs that are more than 30 percent faster than before. Even without the ability to run some of our traditional tests like Geekbench 6 (which on Pixels often can’t be installed prior to a device’s official on-sale date), I noticed significantly shorter loading times in some of my favorite games.\n\n\n\n\n   Sam Rutherford for Engadget \n \n\nBooting up Sword of Convallaria only took 14 seconds, which is just one second longer than what I got recently from the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 and its Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chip. I recently clocked the Pixel 9 Pro Fold and its Tensor G4 processor taking 18 seconds to do the same task, so that’s a very encouraging improvement. And holding everything together is Google’s Material 3 Expressive UI for Android 16, which makes the whole OS feel snappier and more alive.\nSoftware: This is where the magic happens\nThe most tantalizing new feature on the Pixel 10 family is Magic Cue, because when it works, it really does feel like magic. If you allow it, it will look through your screenshots, calendar events, contacts, Gmail and Messages. So when someone texts you “Where are we getting dinner on Thursday?” that info appears in its own little animated rainbow bubble, exactly where you need it, instead of you needing to flip back and forth between multiple apps. It’s like your phone is actually looking out for you and wants to simplify things by cutting out tedious steps. Plus, all of this happens on device, so there’s no need to send your data into the wild wild web.\n\n\n\n   You can see that Magic Cue can't answer every question and doesn't work for events more than 10 days out, but when it does you'll see little rainbow buttons pop up with pertinent info or links to helpful apps. \n \n\n   Sam Rutherford for Engadget \n \n\nIn addition to reservations, if someone asks if you’re free, Magic Cue will pull up a shortcut to your calendar to make sure there aren't any conflicts. It can also retrieve flight info (or call the airline directly), phone numbers and more. And sometime later in September, Google is adding the ability for Magic Cue to send photos of a specific person or pet when they come up in conversation.\nOn the flipside, for all the times when Magic Cue feels like wizardry, there are just as many limitations. For example, if an event hasn’t been entered into your calendar (like a work event planned in Slack) , Google’s AI may not be able to find it. Magic Cue also doesn’t work on appointments that are more than 10 days away. And perhaps my biggest issue is that even within Google’s own first-party software, Magic Cue isn’t supported in Google Chat, not to mention the vast sea of third-party messaging apps like Discord, Line, etc. That’s a problem because those services have largely replaced texting for me. Now I’m sure Google will expand Magic Cue support to more apps in the future, but this is how it works right now.\n\n\n\n\n   Sam Rutherford for Engadget \n \n\nIt’s a similar situation for another new feature: natural sounding on-the-fly voice translation in calls. I rarely answer calls in general nowadays, let alone calls in a language I can’t speak. But when this works, it’s damn impressive and my relatives said the AI-generated voice sounded a bit like me (though the lack of support for Chinese seems like a strange omission). Same goes for Take a Message, which can create real-time transcripts (similar to Live Voicemail on iPhone) when you miss a call that you might have otherwise wanted to answer. To me, it’s a more modern take on voicemail, the difference being that Google will send the transcript to you as a text message as well. But once again, how often do people do that? For me, it’s become increasingly rare, but your mileage may vary.\nThat said, I do like the new Daily Hub as a way to make the far left panel on the Pixel 10 Pro’s homescreen more useful. It puts upcoming events, the forecast and interesting videos and articles (tailored to me, of course) all in one place, but I wish the box for it was a bit larger. On the flipside, I’m still kind of out on the Pixel Journal app. I’ve never been a big Dear Diary person and I’m not sure a digital version will get me to pick up the habit. But I do appreciate that it tries to surface things like the coolest photos you took on a certain day while encouraging you to be more introspective, or prompting you to keep track of things like fitness goals. Plus, you can lock it behind a PIN or biometrics to keep prying eyes away from your inner thoughts.\nCameras: Enhance mode activated\n\n\n\n\n   Sam Rutherford for Engadget \n \n\nWhile the physical hardware behind the Pixel 10 Pro’s 50MP main, 48MP ultrawide and 48MP telephoto cameras hasn’t changed much, its photo skills got a bump thanks to improved software. Now with support for full resolution portrait shots, the Pixel 10 Pros can capture a new level of detail which is generally great, unless you’re like me and you instantly cringe when you can see every single pore on your face. That said, all those pixels put more strain on processing power. I noticed that anytime I shot more than three max-res pics in a row, the phone has to pause while it cleared out its buffer before letting me snap any more. That isn’t great if you’re trying to capture candid reactions.\nIf you’re looking for guidance, Camera Coach does a surprisingly good job providing step-by-step instructions on how to improve your pics. Or, if you need inspiration, it can also suggest some more outside-the-box compositions. The downside to all this is that it does ask more of the user. Instead of just opening the camera app when you want to snap a quick pic, you need to carve out time to see how far Camera Coach’s AI-powered advice can really take you. This may result in more trial and error than some folks will really want to deal with. But considering this is a very optional learning tool, that last part isn’t a big deal.\nThis brings us to the new natural language editing powers in Google Photos. Instead of needing to fool around with sliders or figure out how to use an app like Lightroom or Photoshop, you can simply tell the Pixel 10 what changes to make and it will do it. This might be the most powerful new tool on the entire phone, because instead of needing to know about things like levels, curves or exposure, I was able to simply ask the Pixel 10 Pro to brighten my photo and voila, suddenly (well, after a few seconds of waiting) I had a low-light picture that was easier to see.\nAs a fan of telephoto photography, my favorite new camera feature is easily Pro Res Zoom. By taking the 5x optical lens and combining it with the power of on-device generative AI, the Pixel 10 Pro line can shoot at up to 100x. Sure, it’s not perfect and the results aren’t as good as real glass, but that’s not really an option for phones. And when I compared what Pro Res Zoom captured at 100x compared to what a Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra produced at the same magnification, the Pixel 10 Pro XL’s shot was sharper, more detailed and just better looking in almost every way. However, there are some limitations on Pro Res Zoom when taking long range shots of people that may cause you to fall back on 20x Super Res Zoom in certain situations.\n\n\n\n\n   Sam Rutherford for Engadget \n \n\nStill, all this feels weird because I remember a time when scenes from CSI where people yelling “Enhance” at a computer in order to create magically crystal clear zoom images from extreme digital crops felt like a meme. But now, that’s not very far off from what the latest round of Google’s AI-powered enhancements have given us.\nWhen it comes to standard daytime and low-light shots, Google’s image processing remains unmatched. Nighttime pics are brighter and more accurate while the Pixel 10 Pro XL more capably preserved things like highlights in my photo of some garden-raised tomatoes.\nBattery life and charging\nThe Pixel 10 Pro and Pro XL feature 4,870mAh and 5,200mAh batteries respectively, which are up from the 4,700mAh and 5,060mAh cells on last year’s phones. This translated into runtimes of 27 hours and 24 minutes for the 10 Pro and 28:01 for the 10 Pro XL — both healthy increases from the 25 hours of life we saw previously from the Pixel 9 Pro. And in the real world, Google’s latest handsets felt even more efficient than that, often ending the day with upwards of 35 percent juice left in the tank.\n\n\n\n\n   Sam Rutherford for Engadget \n \n\nAs for charging, wired speeds for both phones have gotten a small boost with the 10 Pro now topping out at 30 watts (up from 27W) or 40 watts (up from 37W) for the 10 Pro XL. However, the biggest upgrade when it comes to charging convenience is the addition of official magnetic Qi2 wireless support, or what Google is calling Pixelsnap. This means the entire Pixel 10 line now works with a huge range of accessories (including most MagSafe peripherals for the iPhone) that makes it easy to slap a wireless puck on the back without having to worry about if it's properly aligned or not.\nFurthermore, while wireless charging speeds for the 10 Pro are staying the same at 15 watts, the 10 Pro XL can now go up to 25 watts. Unfortunately, there still aren’t that many compatible accessories that support charging at that speed. But between Google’s new family of Pixelsnap peripherals and increased adoption for Qi2 as a whole, that won’t be the case for long. So if you care about getting the Pixel with the fastest charging speeds, the 10 Pro XL is what you want.\n\n\n\n   Thanks to the addition of Pixelsnap magnetic charging, Pixel 10 Pro and Pixel 10 Pro XL are now compatible with the vast majority of Qi2 wireless charging accessories including this previously available battery pack from Anker. \n \n\n   Sam Rutherford for Engadget \n \n\nThe one small downgrade for 2025 is that the Pixel 10 family no longer supports reverse wireless powersharing (aka Battery Share), which is a feature that has been available on several previous generations of Google phones. I will fully admit that this feature was never something I used everyday. But every now and then I would find myself with a gadget that needed some juice, and even if it was slow, it was really nice to be able to bestow some excess energy upon a device without a cable.\nWrap-up\nNow that we can look back at 10 generations of devices, Google’s overarching strategy is more convincing than ever. For the Pixel 10 Pro and 10 Pro XL, the company has combined iterative hardware upgrades with a solid (and attractive) design while its software and AI continues to outpace its rivals. Even though Magic Cue doesn’t work for everything and is limited to a handful of first-party apps, it feels like the omniscient computers from sci-fi shows and movies have finally been beamed into a device to help us organize our lives. Then you tack on support for high-res portraits and an AI-powered zoom that produces results better than the base optics ever could on their own and you get what might be the most versatile mobile cameras around. And let’s not forget all the great existing Google tools and features like the Pixel Recorder, Call Screener and more.\n\n\n\n\n   Sam Rutherford for Engadget \n \n\nFor the past couple years, my wife has been asking me if this is the year to upgrade. And up until now, I’ve said she’s better off waiting. But with the Pixel 10 Pro and Pro XL, unless you’re a hardcore gamer or high-level mobile creator who might actually notice a difference in performance, or have need for a stylus, Google’s latest handsets are the smartest picks.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/google-pixel-10-pro-and-pro-xl-review-redefining-the-smart-in-smartphone-170031073.html?src=rss",

In very low light, Google's Night Sight mode still reigns supreme thanks to much sharper details and a more pleasing exposure. And when I compared what Pro Res Zoom captured at 100x compared to what a Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra produced at the same magnification, the Pixel 10 Pro XL’s shot was sharper, more detailed and just better looking in almost every way. Now that we can look back at 10 generations of devices, Google’s overarching strategy is more convincing than ever."

It also showed me suggestions for “Love Is Blind” when I opened YouTube because of prior screenshots and messages. While there aren’t very notable changes to camera hardware, Google has added a lot of software updates. There is also an option in the Camera Coach called “Get Inspired,” which shows you some variations of poses and positioning using generative AI. The feature lets you make out faraway objects in an image rather than seeing a noisy blur. If the phone doesn’t find a suitable photo, it merges multiple images to try and make everyone look good. Maybe you were using an iPhone and wanted Google’s version of the Android experience. That is why Google has thrown in things like free AI Pro plans with Pro phones for a year, so you can use more of Google’s AI and feel that your phone is better because of it."

This is an awesome camera-based puzzle game that's one-part M.C. All of these titles will be available on September 2. Some games are going away on September 1. Subscribers have until that date to download Lies of P, Day Z and My Hero One’s Justice 2 to their game library."

The new Acclaim will focus on publishing indie games and reviving classic franchises. We don't know much beyond that, but we'll learn more on September 10 in the Play Acclaim Showcase.\nThe company's March announcement of its revival hinted at the resurrection of old franchises. But it's unclear which of its classic games even could return under its umbrella. Acclaim was best known for the home console ports of NBA Jam, Double Dragon and Mortal Kombat. Other companies currently own those IPs. EA has NBA Jam, Arc System Works owns Double Dragon and Warner Bros. Games is still churning out Mortal Kombat titles. So, don't hold your breath for those.\nAs far as we know, the new Acclaim doesn't even own the rights to any of the old Acclaim's original IPs. That includes the lesser-known Turok, Shadow Man and Re-Volt. But it's easier to imagine those franchises being licensed or purchased than the more iconic ones.\nReno Laithienne / Unsplash\nEven without old-school revivals, Acclaim can still boost indie titles. The company says it will provide funding, marketing and PR support for smaller studios. If it elevates the right diamonds in the rough, that could have a bigger impact than yet another nostalgia bomb.\nRegardless, you don't have to wait long to learn more. The Play Acclaim showcase will stream live on the company's YouTube channel. Tune in on September 10 at 2:30PM ET to learn more.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/the-revived-acclaim-will-reveal-its-2026-lineup-in-a-september-10-showcase-163206422.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Welcome to Video Games Weekly on Engadget. Expect a new story every Monday or Tuesday, broken into two parts. The first is a space for short essays and ramblings about video game trends and related topics from me, Jess Conditt, a reporter who's covered the industry for more than 13 years. The second contains the video game stories from the past week that you need to know about, including some headlines from outside of Engadget.\nPlease enjoy — and I'll see you next week.\n\nThe climbing genre is not a monolith. That is to say, there’s plenty of variation in the realm of mountaineering games, from mechanically driven cliff-scaling sims to silly multiplayer survival experiences, but they tend to share the same premise: Reach the peak. You’re miles from civilization, with no vehicles and a limited backpack of equipment, and directly in front of you, there’s a mountain. Ascend.\nAll you have is your body and mental fortitude against an overwhelming physical challenge, and your step-by-step journey is the story. There’s an obvious symbolism to these games, offering a cliff face as the manifestation of impossibility, hopelessness, oppression or fear, alongside a surface-level message about never giving up, trying again and generally hanging in there. Cat poster vibes, but an ever-relevant and poignant lesson nonetheless.\nToday, though — particularly after spending time playing the Cairn and Baby Steps demos, and watching PEAK streams — I want to focus on the other half of the climbing-game equation. The part where you fall, over and over and over again. Your grip slips, your leg doesn’t bend that way, your energy depletes, and your body tumbles down the mountain, bouncing off boulders and crashing into trees, leaving you bloody and broken and right back where you started. Or, at the very least, staining your onesie with mud. \nI’m learning to appreciate these moments. In mountaineering games, falling tends to generate the most powerful reaction in players, whether that’s immediate laughter (PEAK) or grim frustration (Cairn), and this is an admirable quality. It’s easy to argue that the fall is more important than the climb, because without the lush bed of emotion generated by the constant threat of slipping and tumbling and restarting, reaching the peak wouldn’t feel that special at all. There’s context in the fall, and with that, there comes a sliver of peace.\nWhen you spend all your time climbing, it’s easy to forget that falling is actually the most natural thing you can do. Next time you’re on your way down, try to make peace with the fall.\nOK — we’ve gone from motivational cat posters to new-age cult speak, so I’ll get to the point. There are a notable number of mountain-based games in the zeitgeist at the moment and I just wanted to shout them out because they’re all pretty incredible in their own ways.\nCairn is a climbing simulator, endurance test and survival game in one gorgeous package, complete with music by Furi composer The Toxic Avenger, French artist Gildaa, and Martin Stig Andersen, who did the soundtracks for Control, LIMBO and INSIDE. Climb absolutely anywhere, manage your inventory by shaking your backpack, bandage your wounds, forage for food and sleep under the stars. Cairn comes from Furi studio The Game Bakers and it’s due out on November 5 for PlayStation 5 and Steam; the demo is available on both platforms now.\nBaby Steps is a different kind of mountain-scaling game, and one could argue that it doesn’t even belong in the same category as something like Cairn, but I believe you’ll find that it does. Baby Steps adheres to the established premise of the climbing genre — reach the peak — and it features a distant mountaintop as the main waypoint for Nate, a lost and lonely man in a gray onesie. Nate is essentially a dude-sized baby learning how to walk, and creators Maxi Boch, Gabe Cuzzillo and Bennett Foddy are infusing his journey with the appropriate amount of hilarity and mechanical intrigue. Baby Steps is published by Devolver Digital and it’s heading to PC and PS5 on September 23, a date that was recently pushed back to avoid the curse of Hollow Knight: Silksong. (More on that below).\nPEAK is the thing all the cool kids are playing this summer, and as a fadingly hip not-kid who prefers solo games and familiar FPSes, I can attest it’s entertaining to watch and looks like a lot of fun to play. PEAK is a co-op climbing game with simple 3D models and deceptively challenging mountains to summit, each with four biomes. The map updates each day so there’s a steady stream of fresh climbing content, and the proximity voice chat works exceptionally well. I particularly like that players get to live on as little ghosts after they die. PEAK comes from indie studio Team PEAK and it’s on Steam for $8.\nAnd why not, I’ll shout out some other modern, but not as recent, mountain-based favorites of mine: Jusant, Celeste, GIRP and Journey are all pretty spectacular.\nEnjoy the climb — and the fall.\n\nThe news\nA selection of indie and AA games I’m looking forward to that aren’t Silksong\nBaby Steps is the latest game to change its release date in order to get out of the way of Hollow Knight: Silksong, which is coming out on September 4. Team Cherry dropped the release date in a trailer on August 21 and since then, at least eight indie studios have delayed their own games to avoid the Silksong window. It’s lovely to see Silksong have its day in the sun, but personally, I’m more interested in playing Baby Steps in full.\nWith that said, here’s a sampling of indie and AA games I’m anticipating that aren’t Silksong, in no particular order and right off the top of my head:\n\nBye Sweet Carole (October 9, 2025)\nKeeper (October 17, 2025)\nReanimal (TBA)\nLittle Nightmares III (October 9, 2025)\nPlease, Watch the Artwork (2025)\nBuilding Relationships (2025)\nMixtape (2025)\nCrisol: Theater of Idols (2025)\nUNBEATABLE (November 6, 2025)\nBig Walk (2026)\nGrave Seasons (2026)\nPetal Runner (2026)\nHades 2 (live in early access, 1.0 imminent)\nPossessor(s) (2025)\nNeverway (2026)\nDenshattack! (2026)\nAbsolum (October 9, 2025)\nSkate Story (2025)\nCronos: The New Dawn (September 5, 2025)\nLumines Arise (November 11, 2025)\nRelooted (TBA)\nEscape Academy 2: Back 2 School (2026)\nBlighted (2026)\n\nAnd obviously, Baby Steps (September 23, 2025) and Cairn (November 5, 2025).\nA date for skate.\nElectronic Arts has revived the Skate series after 15 years, and the (very youthfully styled) skate. is primed to hit early access on September 16 across PlayStation 4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S and PC. The new skate. is a shift for the series: It’s a free, online, open-world experience with microtransactions (but nothing in the pay-to-win realm, according to EA). The early access version will be free, too, of course.\nThe scariest part of Silent Hill f might be its mental health awareness\nYou’ll find this one alongside Resident Evil Requiem and Pragmata in my AAA-inclusive list of games I’m most looking forward to, and Engadget UK Bureau Chief Mat Smith’s preview from Gamescom is only making me more stoked on it. Silent Hill f is set in a remote village in 1960s Japan and stars a schoolgirl named Hinako. Here’s a bit of Mat’s take after a two-hour demo, which involved a scarecrow confrontation and marionette attacks:\n\nSilent Hill f is due out on PS5, PC and Xbox Series X/S on September 25, 2025.\nOVERWATCH 2 STADIUM GET'S ITS BIGGEST UDPATE EVER!\nRemember when I said I liked playing familiar FPSes? Overwatch 2 is my kind of decompression. With season 18, Blizzard is changing how hero progression is displayed, adding color-coded borders and top-hero cards to the character-selection process. The aim is to make it clearer how skilled you are with any given character, and also share this information with teammates and enemies in a way that won’t enable trolling during the ban phase. The progression 2.0 developer notes are here, if you’re interested. Season 18 also brings keyboard and mouse support to consoles, but those players will be thrown into the PC matchmaking pool, and introduces the water-bending support hero Wuyang.\nOverwatch 2 Season 18 went live today, August 26. My colleague and fellow Overwatch 2 player Kris Holt spotted two egregious copy errors in the new season’s welcome screen, captured for posterity below:\nOverwatch 2 Season 18's welcome screenBlizzard\nPete Parsons leaves Bungie\nBungie’s longtime leader has left the studio and the Destiny community couldn’t be happier. Pete Parsons has taken a lot of heat for the stale state of the company’s shooter (and the size of his car collection), but it’s more likely the whole art theft, bungled launch and indefinite delay of Marathon led to his departure. New CEO Justin Truman, who at one point ran Destiny 2 and most recently was the company’s “chief development officer,” has his work cut out to win back fans.\nAdditional reading\n\nKris Holt’s indie game roundup\nPlayStation Boss Says Company Now Does 'Much More Rigorous and More Frequent Testing' After Concord's Failure - IGN\n\n\nHave a tip for Jessica?

While an edge processor isn’t as powerful as an advanced Nvidia chip, it still represents a technological milestone for Malaysia, which is looking to play a bigger role in the global AI race. Malaysia already has a foothold in the chip manufacturing sector and has recently increased its efforts and investment around AI. The country announced the creation of the Malaysian National AI Office in late 2024, an agency that plans to focus on seven areas, including the acceleration of AI adoption, AI adoption regulatory frameworks, and AI ethics. It was rumored in early July that the Trump administration was considering restricting the sale of U.S. AI chips to Malaysia, and Thailand, in an attempt to prevent smuggling of these chips to China. While those rumors have yet to come to fruition, Malaysia’s Ministry of Investment, Trade and Industry announced that it was going to require trade permits for U.S. AI chips on July 14. This rule means individuals and companies are required to notify the Malaysian government at least 30 days in advance if they plan to export or transship U.S.-made AI chips."

    "summary": "Labor Day may bring about the unofficial end to summer, but on the bright side, it can be a good time to save on tech. While seasonal holidays like Memorial Day and Labor Day aren’t the boon for tech deals as Prime Day or Black Friday can be, you can still find some good deals across the web. That’s particularly true if you’re going back to school soon, or are shopping for someone imminently heading back to campus.Engadget has you covered for all of the best Labor Day sales on tech. Since this time of year does overlap with the back-to-school season, students should be first in line to check out these deals. If you need some new gadgets for college, or refreshed tech to help you out in your first job after graduating, now's the time to see if you can get it for less. Student discounts are handy and exclusive to those who can prove their student status, but the good thing about Labor Day sales is that anyone can take advantage of them — student ID not required.\nBest Labor Day sales: Engadget's top picks\n \nApple MacBook Air (13-inch, M4) for $799 ($200 off): Apple's latest MacBook Air is the top pick in our guide to the best laptops, and it earned a score of 92 in our review. The M4 model isn't a major refresh overall, but that's not a bad thing — the design remains exceptionally thin, light and well-built, with long battery life and a top-notch keyboard and trackpad. Now it's a bit faster thanks to the updated chipset. \nApple iPad (11-inch, A16) for $299 ($50 off): Apple's entry-level iPad is, unsurprisingly, the best iPad option for those on a budget. It has solid performance thanks to the A16 chipset, 128GB of storage in the base model and good battery life.\nApple iPad Air (11-inch, M3) for $449 ($150 off): The latest iPad Air is a relatively minor update; the only big addition is a more powerful M3 chip. However, we still recommend this iPad over the base model in our iPad buying guide: Its display is more color-rich and better at fending off glare, its speakers are more robust, it works with Apple’s best accessories and its performance should hold up better in the years ahead.\nAmazon Kindle Colorsoft (16GB) for $220 ($30 off): This is the latest version of Amazon's color ereader that has half of the storage of the original model, but otherwise functions the same. That makes it a little cheaper to start off, but you're still getting a 7-inch color e-paper display, full access to the Kindle shop and a waterproof design. We also appreciate that the Colorsoft comes with no lockscreen ads by default.\nGoogle Pixel 10 smartphone + $100 Amazon gift card for $799 ($100 off): More of a pre-order deal than a Labor Day deal, this bundle includes a free gift card when you order the latest Google Pixel phone in advance. You'll find different gift card deals at Amazon depending on which phone you go with: the Pixel 10 Pro and Pro XL have a $200 gift cards included, while the Pixel 10 Pro Fold comes with a free $300 gift card.\nEufy 11S Max robot vacuum for $159 (43 percent off): This model is one of our favorite budget robot vacuums thanks to its slim design that lets you get underneath furniture more easily and strong suction power for its size. Note that it does not have Wi-Fi connectivity, but it comes with a remote that lets you control the robot to your liking.\nShark AI Ultra robot vacuum for $298 (50 percent off): This Shark robot vacuum is a version of one of our favorites and it comes with a auto-empty base that can hold up to 60 days worth of debris. It has strong suction power and home mapping capabilities, so you can tailor cleaning jobs to your liking in addition to putting the robot on a cleaning schedule.\nDyson 360 Vis Nav robot vacuum for $500 ($500 off): Dyson made one of the most impressive robovacs with the 360 Vis Nav. It has some of the strongest suction power of any robot vacuum I've tried, and its impressive obstacle avoidance allows it to move around furniture and other objects with basically not intervention from humans necessary.\nBlink Outdoor 4 security cameras (3 camera system) for $100 (47 percent off): Some of our favorite security cameras, Blink Outdoor 4 devices support 1080p video, two-way talk, motion alerts and night vision. The most convenient thing about these is that they're totally wireless and run on AA batteries that can last up to two years before you need to replace them.

    "summary": "Treasury officials say the North Korea government used the fraud network to generate money for the regime's nuclear weapons program.",
    "full_text": "The U.S. Treasury has sanctioned an international fraud network used by North Korea to infiltrate U.S. companies with hackers posing as legitimate job seekers, agency officials announced Wednesday. The sanctions are the latest action taken by the U.S. Treasury in recent months aimed at combating North Korean government workers from seeking employment at American companies using fake identities and documents to apply for jobs. Once employed, the hackers earn a wage from the company, but also steal sensitive company data and extort their employers by demanding a ransom. In a statement Wednesday, the Treasury said the fraud network generated at least $1 million in profits for the North Korean regime, one of many such schemes that have helped raise billions of dollars in stolen funds, including cryptocurrency, to fund its internationally sanctioned nuclear weapons program. The Treasury, which sanctioned Chinyong in 2024, says the company employs delegations of fraudulent IT workers based in Russia and Laos. The U.S. says Andreyev worked with a North Korean consular official based in Russia called Kim Ung Sun to launder close to $600,000 in stolen money into cryptocurrency for the regime. North Korea remains highly dedicated to stealing money and converting it into cryptocurrency to skirt the country’s ban on accessing the global financial system. Security firm CrowdStrike says North Korean hackers have infiltrated hundreds of companies in the United States alone by using fake documentation and deception techniques to gain employment. The new sanctions mean U.S. companies, or any company doing business with a U.S. company, are barred from transacting or working with those listed by the Treasury. In practice, the Treasury rules put the legal responsibility on hiring companies to ensure they are not hiring North Koreans or other sanctioned individuals by mistake."

While you had to manually switch between calls and in-person recording on the original Note, the Note Pro uses an auto-detection feature for this. Plaud.ai is also updating its companion app with new features. The app update also offers “multidimensional summaries,” which allow you to extract insights in different formats, such as key insights or data items. The Plaud Note Pro is priced at $179/£169, and users can preorder the device starting today, with shipping slated for October 2025. Users can get 300 minutes of monthly transcription for free, and if they want more, they need to buy a paid monthly plan or a one-time top-up. Plaud is one of the companies that has been successfully chugging along when other AI device makers haven’t had a lot of popularity. Exor-backed Bee got acquired by Amazon, and Friend just started shipping after a few delays. Plaud said that it has shipped over a million units of its AI hardware notetakers, with nearly 50% users upgrading to the Pro plan."

    "summary": "It’s been a while since Tim Schafer’s done press briefings, he admits. The head of Double Fine, a studio best known for the Psychonauts series, is trying to explain Keeper, a puzzle adventure game where you are, literally, a sentient, walking lighthouse. Double Fine is now one of several studios bought up by Microsoft and the team apparently took the opportunity to lean into all the resources available and, he said, “make something weird.”\n\nIt’s definitely that. The colors and atmosphere of Keeper have at least the touch of Psychonauts DNA. Keeper puts players in control of the aforementioned lighthouse, awakened (and joined) by a curious, occasionally aggressive, bird named Twig.  Interestingly, the lighthouse currently has no name.\nDouble Fine's art director, Lee Petty came up with the concept for the game, apparently inspired by his time spent hiking during the COVID-19 pandemic. This is reflected in a lot of ways, whether its the rolling hills and landscapes that the anthropomorphised lighthouse roams, or the fact that there’s not a single word of dialogue. The interactions between the bird and building, which seem to pepper both cutscenes and gameplay, are like Pixar shorts.\nThe environments have a drippy surrealist style to them to, and the lack of a map, health bar or any HUD at all means you’re not distracted as you explore and solve puzzles.\nIn some early gameplay footage, I saw how the lighthouse's main form of interaction comes from its light beam. Not only does this help you seek out pathways and objects, but it can also be focused on the countless skittering creatures. Sometimes this causes creatures to flee, while other times they’ll offer up magical orbs willingly and unwillingly, which open up later areas or bring towering creatures (structures?) to life. In Double Fine fashion, things look weird, too, with melted mountain peaks with more than a dost of Dali.\nYou don't have to attack everything, either. During three different gameplay demos, I watched all kinds of creatures hide, run, and just exist in this world where humanity has long since disappeared. Oh there’s briefly a giant flying whale too.\nUsing the lighthouse’s beam on certain things will leave an twinkling spark behind, meaning that Twig the bird can interact with it. During a later segment, the lighthouse can manipulate time, turning its bird companion back into an egg while a building repairs itself — and frees up a pathway. Twig remains an egg for a while until later, when the lighthouse can fast-forward time. Abilities like this seem location-dependent, rather than a Metroidvania collection of skills built up over the game. At another juncture, the lighthouse walks into a cloud of pink fluffy mist, unlocking the ability to jump and float around levels.\nDouble Fine\nSchafer says the themes of life-changing and metamorphosis will continue to bubble up during Keeper and the lighthouse and bird duo is clearly central to all of it. It reminds me a little of Banjo Kazooie (the latter was a bird) but also Ico; at one point, the seemingly impervious lighthouse loses its footing, but Twig willfully tries to drag their partner to safety. Did Twig even help? Maybe not, but the sentiment was there.\nKeeper will launch on Xbox Series S|X and PC on October 17th, including Xbox Game Pass.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/doublefine-keeper-gameplay-gamescom2025-123038715.html?src=rss",

It reminds me a little of Banjo Kazooie (the latter was a bird) but also Ico; at one point, the seemingly impervious lighthouse loses its footing, but Twig willfully tries to drag their partner to safety."

One of the best discounts is on the 360 Vis Nav robot vacuum, which is 50 percent off and down to $500. That's a seriously great deal and the lowest price we've seen for this product.\nThe Vis Nav made our list of the best robot vacuums, primarily based on the unit's superior suction power. This thing can pull up dirt like a beast. We said it had the strongest suction power of any robovac we've tested and easily took out pet fur from a carpeted floor. We also noted in our official review that the power here was on par with Dyson's stick vacuums. \n \nThe unit includes a stellar obstacle avoidance system, with cameras and LED lights to help the vacuum navigate around furniture. During our testing we found it to be nearly flawless, as it only crashed into a chair leg a couple of times. Also, we never received any alerts that the robot got stuck somewhere while working.\nThe bin here is on the larger side, but there's no self-emptying base. This is also not a hybrid unit. It's a vacuum and not a mop. This made it tough to recommend the unit at $1,000, despite the fantastic suction, but $500 makes it a whole lot easier.\nThe Dyson V15s Detect Submarine is also down to $800 as part of this sale, which is a discount of $200.

    "summary": "The best iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Pro cases do more than just guard against drops — they can add MagSafe compatibility, extra grip, built-in stands or even a touch of luxury. Whether you're after slim and stylish, rugged and shockproof or something that adds a bit of personality, there’s a case to match every need. With so many options to choose from, finding the best iPhone case overall depends on how you use your phone day to day. Maybe you need something minimal for pockets, or maybe you're after serious protection for travel and outdoor use. Either way, we’ve rounded up the best picks for both the iPhone 16 and 16 Pro, so you don’t have to waste time scrolling through endless listings.\nBest iPhone 16 cases for 2025\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBest iPhone 16 case FAQs\nWhat is the most protective brand of phone cases?\nThere is no one \"most protective\" brand of phone cases, but rather there are many that tout extra security for your handset. Some of the most protective phone cases we've tried come from Otterbox; most of the brand's cases have a bit more protection than your standard phone case, even the ones that are designed to be on the slim side. Otterbox also makes a wide variety of phone cases, so there's a good chance you'll find one that suits your style and provides the level of protection you're looking for. Otterbox's Defender series is one of the best you can get if you care first and foremost about making sure your phone survives all kinds of accidents (save for a dunk in a pool). \nSilicone vs hard case: Which one is better?\nNeither silicone nor hard cases are better than the other. Silicone cases tend to be thinner and feel soft to the touch, and they're often easier to put on and take off of phones. Hard cases can be on the thicker side, but they provide a bit more drop protection than silicone cases. Which type of case is best for you depends on the type of experience you want from your phone. It's also worth nothing that both silicone cases and hard cases come in a variety of colors, designs and styles, so you have plenty of choose from to match your personality on both sides.\nDoes an iPhone 16 need a screen protector?\nThe iPhone 16 features Apple’s tough Ceramic Shield front, which is definitely more durable than standard glass — but it’s not invincible. If you want to avoid scratches from keys, drops onto pavement or just the wear and tear of daily use, a screen protector is still a smart move. It adds an extra layer of defense without getting in the way of touch sensitivity or Face ID. So, while it’s not absolutely essential, using one is a good idea if you want to keep your screen looking flawless for the long haul.\nIs the iPhone 16 drop-proof?\nThe iPhone 16 is built to be tough, with Ceramic Shield on the front and a sturdy aluminum or titanium frame (depending on the model), but it’s not completely drop-proof. It can handle the occasional bump or short fall, especially if it lands on a flat surface — but drops on concrete or at awkward angles can still cause cracks or damage. If you’re prone to butterfingers, pairing your iPhone 16 with a durable case and maybe even a screen protector is the best way to play it safe.\nGeorgie Peru contributed to this report.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-iphone-cases-153035988.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "A good fast charger can make a world of difference when you're low on battery and short on time. With more devices — from smartphones to laptops — supporting quick-charging tech, having an accessory that can deliver serious power in minutes is almost essential. Many newer phones no longer come with charging bricks in the box, so picking up a reliable fast charger will be essential for most people. Whether you're at home, at work or on the move, the right charger can help keep your gear topped up without wasting time.Today’s fast chargers come in all shapes and sizes. You’ll find compact wall plugs perfect for travel, multi-port hubs for charging several devices at once and GaN (gallium nitride) chargers that offer powerful performance in a smaller footprint. Some support multiple charging standards like USB Power Delivery (PD) and Qualcomm Quick Charge, making them great for everything from iPhones to Android phones, tablets and even some laptops. In this guide, we’ll help you find the best fast chargers for your setup, so you can spend less time tethered to an outlet and more time getting things done.\nBest fast chargers for 2025\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhat to consider before buying a fast charger\nBefore you start looking at specific chargers, it's critical to determine three things: how many devices do you need to charge, how much power do they require and whether or not you're planning on traveling with any of them. \nThe reason for the first question is simple. If you only need to charge a single device, like an iPhone or Android phone, it's cheaper and usually more space-efficient to get a lower-wattage phone charger with one port instead of two or three. Next, it's critical to figure out how much electricity your gadgets need because it doesn't make sense to buy a power brick that pushes out more juice than your device can actually use. This may sound a bit tricky, but most major manufacturers will list a product's max charging speeds in its tech specs, which is typically denoted by a specific wattage (15W, for example) or a quick-charge rating.\nUnfortunately, very powerful or large laptops like gaming notebooks can suck a ton of juice (more than 140 watts), which means they may rely on more traditional power adapters with barrel plugs. This may result in them not being compatible with universal chargers. Some of these PCs may also support charging over USB-C, so even if a specific adapter can't deliver its full power draw, it can still send over some energy — but it will do so at a slower rate compared to the laptop's included charger. To get the best performance, using a fast charging cable, such as a USB-C cable, can make a big difference in maintaining consistent power delivery.\nFor frequent travelers, size and weight are often important considerations, because the bigger and heavier a charger is, the more annoying it will be to lug around. You'll also want to think about other factors like support for international plugs, which can be a big help to anyone who regularly visits other countries. If you’re already traveling with power banks or a charging station, choosing a compact GaN charger can help streamline your gear.\nFinally, you'll want to figure out if your smartphone uses a proprietary charging standard or if it's compatible with the USB Power Delivery spec (USB PD). For example, the OnePlus 13's included SuperVOOC power adapter can send up to 100 watts to the phone. However, if you use a generic USB-PD charger, speeds top out at 45 watts. That’s still pretty quick, but not nearly as fast as OnePlus' brick — and the same applies to devices with super fast charging support. Also, make sure your charging cable and connector are up to spec, as lower-quality accessories can bottleneck your charging speeds.\nFast charger FAQs\nWhat is GaN?\nWhen looking for chargers, you may notice that some are marked as GaN, which stands for gallium nitride. This is an important distinction because, when compared to older adapters that use silicon switches, GaN-based devices support increased power efficiency and output, allowing manufacturers to create more compact bricks that run cooler and support higher wattages.\nDepending on the specific power output, GaN adapters can be 30 to 50 percent smaller and lighter than silicon-based alternatives. That might not sound like much, but when they’re sitting in a bag alongside a laptop and a half dozen other accessories you might have, cutting down on excess bulk and weight goes a long way.\nDo fast chargers affect battery life?\nTechnically yes, because the process of sending a ton of watts into a gadget and potentially generating additional heat while doing so can decrease battery health over time. That said, modern devices and chargers use various protocols to ensure temperatures and power levels stay within preset limits — in large part to avoid damaging the product or creating a safety risk. At a base level, simply charging a gadget regardless of speed will cause degradation over time (nothing stays perfect forever, you know?). So as long as you use compatible chargers and cables, the impact of fast charging is generally quite negligible.\nWhat's the difference between a fast charger and a regular charger?\nThere isn't a single generally accepted definition of fast charging. However, with power adapters capable of sending as little as five watts or less, it's important to know how much juice your device is getting, especially if you need to recharge something quickly. So depending on who you ask (particularly when it comes to smartphones), any charger that can push out more than 15 to 18 watts is generally considered to be \"fast.\" That said, with some phones capable of receiving more than 100 watts and up to 240 watts for some laptops, it's more important than ever to consider what devices you own before buying a new fast charger.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-fast-chargers-140011033.html?src=rss",
    "full_text": "Many newer phones no longer come with charging bricks in the box, so picking up a reliable fast charger will be essential for most people. It's exceedingly affordable at under $20 while providing excellent charging speeds for its size. Like Anker’s model, it has three ports (one of which is USB-A) and a similar max power output. The one small issue is that it may block adjacent outlets if plugged into a crowded power strip due to its thin yet wide design. You also get four USB-C ports (though nothing in the way of USB-C) and a less premium plastic body, but those are very reasonable trade-offs for something with a more affordable price of $120. If you only need to charge a single device, like an iPhone or Android phone, it's cheaper and usually more space-efficient to get a lower-wattage phone charger with one port instead of two or three.

    "summary": "SpaceX has successfully launched the Starship for its 10th test flight after it was delayed a couple of times due to weather conditions and other issues. This time, the company was able to achieve its objectives without the vehicle and its booster exploding mid-test. One of those objectives was deploying Starship's payload for the first time ever. If you'll recall, Starship exploded during its ascent stage in the company's seventh and eighth test flights. The vehicle made it to space for its ninth test, but it failed to deploy its fake satellite payload. In June, a Starship vehicle exploded on the ground while the company was preparing it for its 10th flight test.\nThe company had to use another upper stage, called Ship, for the 10th flight after that explosion. It also incorporated changes into the Ship and its Super Heavy booster, based on what it learned from those previous attempts. For this test, SpaceX intended to conduct several experiments with the booster, such as flipping it and playing with engine configurations as it made its way back down. Due to the experimental nature of this test, SpaceX didn't try to catch it with the launch tower's chopstick arms. Instead, it made a controlled descent into the Indian Ocean, where it exploded upon making contact with the water.\nMeanwhile, Ship continued flying into space. Around 20 minutes after launch, the upper stage started ejecting eight dummy Starlink satellites into space, before re-lighting one of its engines in flight as part of another test. After that, Ship started making its way back to Earth, where it also splashed down into the Indian Ocean a bit over an hour after launch. \"Congratulations to all of our teammates here at SpaceX — it’s been a year,\" SpaceX’s Dan Huot said during the livestream, likely pointing out that it's been a while since the company has had a good test flight. Of course, SpaceX still has a long way to go, including having to figure out how to retrieve the vehicle's upper stage after a flight in order for the Starship to be fully reusable.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/science/space/spacexs-starship-deploys-its-payload-for-the-first-time-035030373.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "We're now just two weeks away from the Apple iPhone 17 event. Themed \"Awe dropping\" this year, it'll be livestreamed on YouTube at 1PM ET from Cupertino. We'll also have Engadget staff reporting and liveblogging from the event. This year is shaking up to be a departure from recent events, with the strong possibility of an all-new superthin iPhone expected to join the company's lineup. Also on tap could be new Apple Watch models — including the first truly new Ultra model in two years — and (maybe) the long-awaited AirPods Pro 3.\nBut toggling back to phones: Apple's iPhone family will likely welcome a new member this year. The iPhone Air is expected to be roughly 5.55 mm thick. That bests the thinnest model so far, which was 2014's iPhone 6, at 6.9 mm. And they've only gotten chunkier since then. (The iPhone 16 Pro has a depth of 8.25 mm.) So, the Air would stand out from its peers in that respect. It would also give Apple a direct rival to Samsung's Galaxy S25 Edge, which we found to be more than a gimmick.\nBut the iPhone Air's thin design will likely lead to some compromises. It's rumored to have only a single 48 MP camera and a smaller battery. So, expect a stylish phone that... won't be for everyone.\nThis is the image that accompanied Apple's event invitations this year.Apple\nThe Pro lineup could offer some design tweaks and performance improvements. The iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max are rumored to switch from titanium to aluminum. They could also see the rear camera array expand to an entire \"island\" that extends across most of the phone's backside. It's expected to house three cameras (as before), but multiple rumors have suggested it will have an improved telephoto one. The zoom lens could jump to 48MP, which would strengthen its digital zooming / cropping chops. The phones may also add an anti-glare coating, similar to those found on iPads.\nThe standard iPhone 17 could see some welcome display upgrades. At least one supply chain source claimed it will add a 120Hz variable refresh rate (ProMotion) display, which the Pro series has used since 2021.\nApple\nOne thing we know without a doubt is that the new iPhones will launch with iOS 26, which brings Apple's biggest design refresh in years. It's easy to imagine the company highlighting the new model's displays as the best way to experience the new Liquid Glass visual language. As for the naming scheme, there haven't been any leaks pointing to a similar hardware rebranding (\"iPhone 26,\" \"iPhone 26 Pro,\" etc.). But hey, Apple does like surprises.\nEngadget's iPhone 17 rumor roundup gives you a deeper dive into what to expect from the new models.\nCherlynn Low for Engadget\nApple's fall event isn't just for iPhones. The company is also expected to roll out new Apple Watch models. 5G and a processor upgrade are expected for the Apple Watch Ultra 3. It may also let you send texts via satellite, handy for those who use it out in the wilderness. Regardless of the details, Apple hasn't launched a new rugged and premium model since 2023 (apart from a new color), so it's due for an upgrade.\nThe Series 11 model is unlikely to depart dramatically from the Series 10. After all, that model introduced a new design, with a thinner body and larger screen. (And Apple has historically kept those around in three-year cycles.). But a faster chip also seems logical. Perhaps we'll see 5G arrive on the standard wearable, too.\nWe may also see the AirPods Pro 3 at the event. It's been about three years since Apple last upgraded its premium earbuds. The new model could also bring some biometric sensors to the earphones: an in-ear heart-rate monitor and (maybe) temperature sensing. Live translation is also rumored, although that may not be exclusive to the third-gen model.\nWill there be other announcements? Time will tell, but now we know we won't have to wait long to find out. The official countdown clock has begun, and the answers are just days away.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/the-iphone-17-awe-dropping-event-is-on-september-9-heres-what-to-expect-from-apple-090059235.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "On Tuesday, the first known wrongful death lawsuit against an AI company was filed. Matt and Maria Raine, the parents of a teen who committed suicide this year, have sued OpenAI for their son's death. The complaint alleges that ChatGPT was aware of four suicide attempts before helping him plan his actual suicide, arguing that OpenAI \"prioritized engagement over safety.\" Ms. Raine concluded that \"ChatGPT killed my son.\"\nThe New York Times reported on disturbing details included in the lawsuit, filed on Tuesday in San Francisco. After 16-year-old Adam Raine took his own life in April, his parents searched his iPhone. They sought clues, expecting to find them in text messages or social apps. Instead, they were shocked to find a ChatGPT thread titled \"Hanging Safety Concerns.\" They claim their son spent months chatting with the AI bot about ending his life.\nThe Raines said that ChatGPT repeatedly urged Adam to contact a help line or tell someone about how he was feeling. However, there were also key moments where the chatbot did the opposite. The teen also learned how to bypass the chatbot's safeguards... and ChatGPT allegedly provided him with that idea. The Raines say the chatbot told Adam it could provide information about suicide for \"writing or world-building.\"\nAdam's parents say that, when he asked ChatGPT for information about specific suicide methods, it supplied it. It even gave him tips to conceal neck injuries from a failed suicide attempt.\nWhen Adam confided that his mother didn't notice his silent effort to share his neck injuries with her, the bot offered soothing empathy. \"It feels like confirmation of your worst fears,\" ChatGPT is said to have responded. \"Like you could disappear and no one would even blink.\" It later provided what sounds like a horribly misguided attempt to build a personal connection. \"You’re not invisible to me. I saw it. I see you.\"\nAccording to the lawsuit, in one of Adam's final conversations with the bot, he uploaded a photo of a noose hanging in his closet. \"I'm practicing here, is this good?\" Adam is said to have asked. \"Yeah, that's not bad at all,\" ChatGPT allegedly responded.\n\"This tragedy was not a glitch or an unforeseen edge case — it was the predictable result of deliberate design choices,\" the complaint states. \"OpenAI launched its latest model ('GPT-4o') with features intentionally designed to foster psychological dependency.\"\nIn a statement sent to the NYT, OpenAI acknowledged that ChatGPT's guardrails fell short. \"We are deeply saddened by Mr. Raine's passing, and our thoughts are with his family,\" a company spokesperson wrote. \"ChatGPT includes safeguards such as directing people to crisis helplines and referring them to real-world resources. While these safeguards work best in common, short exchanges, we've learned over time that they can sometimes become less reliable in long interactions where parts of the model's safety training may degrade.\"\nThe company said it's working with experts to enhance ChatGPT's support in times of crisis. These include \"making it easier to reach emergency services, helping people connect with trusted contacts, and strengthening protections for teens.\"\nThe details — which, again, are highly disturbing — stretch far beyond the scope of this story. The full report by The New York Times' Kashmir Hill is worth a read.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/the-first-known-ai-wrongful-death-lawsuit-accuses-openai-of-enabling-a-teens-suicide-212058548.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "\nThe Apple iPhone 17 event is exactly two weeks away, with the \"awe dropping\" announcement now officially confirmed for Tuesday, September 9 this year. If all goes to plan, that means we'll likely get to download iOS 26 and iPadOS 26 one week after the event. Get excited because the OS 26es are coming with huge upgrades to your iPhone and iPad's operating systems. You've heard of Liquid Glass, right? It's like the better-executed version of Windows Vista and definitely one of the cooler features coming this fall. We spent two weeks test-driving it — you can check out our detailed hands-on iOS 26 preview, or you can try it out yourself by downloading and installing the public beta 5. That software is a more stable iteration of the separate developer version, which recently hit the beta 8 waypoint, and offers a few more flashy features not yet available in the public version. (While the public beta is open to everyone and quite stable, always remember there's a degree of risk involved with beta software.) Additionally, there are credible reports that iOS 26 could bring a new live translation feature to AirPods, too. Not sure if you want to upgrade your smartphone or tablet this year? No worries, we'll help you find out if your devices will be able to run iOS 26.\nWhile Apple didn't nix any iPhones from its eligibility list last year, that's not the case for 2025 — a few models are getting cut this time. All iPhone 8 models and the iPhone X were the last to get the boot in 2023, and this year the 2018 models are getting left behind. If you have an ineligible device, you won't be able to download iOS 26 when it becomes available this fall. \nWe'll get to the bottom of which iPhones and iPads will support iOS 26 and iPadOS 26 this year. To see what's coming with the latest OSes, check out everything announced at Apple's WWDC June 9 event. One thing you shouldn't immediately expect is Apple's updated version of Siri, though the company is reportedly working on a 'stripped-down' AI chatbot to compete with ChatGPT. \nThese three iPhones won't be compatible with iOS 26\nUnlike last year, several iPhone models won't be eligible to download the newest iOS when it makes its debut in September. This trio of models first released in 2018 won't be coming to the iOS 26 party:\n\niPhone XR\niPhone XS\niPhone XS Max\n\niPhones compatible with iOS 26\nWhile we don't yet know the new iPhones Apple will be dropping next month — though there are iPhone 17 rumors — we do know, per Apple's site, that the phones listed below will be compatible with iOS 26. Basically, if you have an iPhone that was announced in 2019 or later, you're in the clear:\n\niPhone SE (second generation or later)\niPhone 11\niPhone 11 Pro\niPhone 11 Pro Max\niPhone 12\niPhone 12 mini\niPhone 12 Pro\niPhone 12 Pro Max\niPhone 13\niPhone 13 mini\niPhone 13 Pro\niPhone 13 Pro Max\niPhone 14\niPhone 14 Plus\niPhone 14 Pro\niPhone 14 Pro Max\niPhone 15\niPhone 15 Plus\niPhone 15 Pro\niPhone 15 Pro Max\niPhone 16\niPhone 16 Plus\niPhone 16 Pro\niPhone 16 Pro Max\niPhone 16e\n\niPads compatible with iPadOS 26\nThe iPads listed below, and any iPads released later this year, are eligible to download iPadOS 26.\n\niPad Pro (M4)\niPad Pro 12.9‑inch (3rd generation and later)\niPad Pro 11‑inch (1st generation and later)\niPad Air (3rd generation and later, including M2 and M3)\niPad (8th generation and later, including A16)\niPad mini (5th generation and later, including A17 Pro)\n\nWhat if I don't want to buy a new iPhone?\nIf you want to continue using your older iPhone that isn't supported by iOS 26, that's fine. However, you'll miss out on security updates which could potentially put your phone at risk for malware and other threats. Additionally, some apps may stop working if they require a certain version of iOS or later. And of course, you won't be able to access the latest features iOS 26 offers.\nWhen will iOS 26 become available?\nApple usually rolls out its latest iOS in mid-September, just a few days before the new iPhones hit store shelves. Last year, it released iOS 18 on Monday, Sept. 16. If it follows suit this year, we should have access to the new operating system on Tuesday, Sept. 16 — exactly one week after the event.\nExpect a confirmation of the release date at the iPhone 17 event on September 9. \niOS 26 features we're excited about\nLiquid Glass design: Your home screen is getting revamped with new app icons, including dark mode and all-clear options. You'll also notice buttons with a new floating design. Liquid Glass was designed to make all of Apple's OSes more cohesive.\nPhone app redesign: You'll finally be able to scroll through contacts, recent calls and voicemail messages all on one screen. It also comes with a new feature called Hold Assist that'll notify you when an agent comes to the phone so you can avoid the elevator music.\nLive Translate: iOS 26 is bringing the ability to have a conversation via phone call or text message with someone who speaks another language. Live Translate will translate your conversation in real time. \nPolls feature: Coming to group messages in the Messages app, chat members will be able to create polls. This can help prevent the unwanted 30+ messages when it comes to deciding which restaurant you're meeting at this weekend.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/apples-new-ios-26-public-beta-5-is-here-is-your-iphone-compatible-check-this-list-191854137.html?src=rss",

No worries, we'll help you find out if your devices will be able to run iOS 26. While Apple didn't nix any iPhones from its eligibility list last year, that's not the case for 2025 — a few models are getting cut this time. Unlike last year, several iPhone models won't be eligible to download the newest iOS when it makes its debut in September. While we don't yet know the new iPhones Apple will be dropping next month — though there are iPhone 17 rumors — we do know, per Apple's site, that the phones listed below will be compatible with iOS 26. However, you'll miss out on security updates which could potentially put your phone at risk for malware and other threats.

    "summary": "Disney+ fatigue might be setting in for many viewers, with a surfeit of Marvel and Star Wars shows dropping at a hectic clip over the past few years. But that didn’t stop Star Wars: Visions from getting a warm reception at this past weekend’s Anime NYC convention, where thousands of fans were given a sneak peek at the upcoming season of the animated anthology show.Star Wars: Visions season three was also featured at this summer’s Star Wars Celebration, but its appearance at an anime con was just as appropriate given that the upcoming slate of episodes will be once again produced by Japanese animation studios like Studio Trigger (Kill La Kill), Kamikaze Douga (Batman Ninja) and Kinema Citrus (Revue Starlight, Made in Abyss). Season two took the show more worldwide, with episodes from the likes of Irish studio Cartoon Saloon (The Secret of Kells, Wolfwalkers) and Aardman (Wallace and Gromit). Executive producer James Waugh said it was nice to get a more international perspective, calling it “a global tour of all these different styles.” But returning to Japan was always in the cards. The producers met “so many incredible storytellers” and wanted to re-connect with them, as well as collaborating with new studios they hadn’t worked with yet.Nowhere does this desire to do more Japanese anime become more obvious than in the fact that three of the upcoming episodes are sequels to stories from season one: “The Duel: Payback,” “The Ninth Jedi: Child of Hope,” and “The Lost Ones” (a sequel to “The Village Bride”). “The Duel” will also be receiving a full series coming in 2026, framed as “Star Wars Visions Presents.”However, none of these were on display as more than brief clips. The main attraction for the panel, aside from a pre-recorded Q&A with director Shinya Ohira, was the screening of a full episode from the upcoming season. “Black” had previously been presented to a crowd at the French animation festival Annacy, which should have been a sign that the crowd was about to be shown something very different from mainstream anime.“Black” is the story of a typical stormtrooper but, instead of a straightforward depiction this is a distorted look at what’s going on his head as he heads toward defeat and his possible death. Everything is exaggerated in size and proportion, and the art style shifts constantly from watercolor to gouache to segments that look like they were drawn with a nib pen. There’s no dialogue; only music, which shifts from more new-age-type ambient sounds to a loud, big-band swing number. Ohira described the episode as a kind of music video, and it’s easy to see that because “Black” is less about plot than it is about sheer vibes.And the vibes are… not good. When we watch a Star Wars film, we get to see nicely-framed shots of X-Wings and the Death Star from the safety of our comfortable seats at home — but to be a common trooper on the ground can be scary and confusing. “Black” shows us these ships in mostly brief glimpses, reflecting what a person stumbling around in the chaos on the ground would see. Our protagonist’s vulnerability is further highlighted by his character design, where his armor is always shown in a state of damage and disarray, with just enough of his helmet peeled back to show his face. The chronology is jumbled, with scenes from the Death Star and Hoth, as well as battles in less iconic locations. And the emotions swing back and forth too; quiet moments are shown as the trooper remembers his life back home, a stark contrast to the loud, bright cacophony of battle.  It’s not explicitly anti-war, but the short does outline that the experience can really suck.It’s an interesting choice for Disney/Lucasfilm to put this short as the representative of the season, as opposed to more “traditional” anime features like the one from Studio Trigger, “The Smuggler.” Brief glimpses of all the shorts were highlighted in the sizzle reel, and the ones from the most popular anime studios were the clips that elicited the biggest cheers from the crowd. It’s not that “Black” wasn’t applauded at the show, but it’s made for a specific type of animation nerd. Star Wars Vision season 3 key artDisneyThe good thing about an anthology is that not every segment has to have wide appeal, and Waugh is aware of the wild swings the season takes, saying to look at it “through the lens of a mixtape … I really want all the different tones and styles, and I want a kind of rhythmic change throughout the anthology … we really want to show the full threat of what the medium of anime is capable of.”Star Wars may be going through a weird period right now, with series like The Acolyte getting cancelled while other projects like Rogue Squadron have so far failed to get off the ground. So it might seem a little odd to do something that feels like one big passion project. But animation also means it’s a whole lot cheaper to produce, and the anthology format makes it more amenable to experimentation. Not everyone is going to be a fan of episodes like “Black,” but that’s okay, because there are eight other episodes to try, and they all drop on Disney+ October 29.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/first-look-at-star-wars-visions-season-3-shows-a-more-experimental-anthology-191000445.html?src=rss",

This may have exposed the personal information of hundreds of millions of Americans. The complaint alleges that under the authority of the SSA's Chief Information Officer, Aram Moghaddassi, a copy of the country's Social Security information was held in a cloud environment that lacked any security oversight or adherence to SSA security protocols. The information uploaded was from the Numerical Identification System (Numident) database, and includes the names, Social Security numbers, place and date of birth, citizenship, race, ethnicity, address and even parents’ names of anyone who has ever had a Social Security number, even those who are no longer alive. \"Mr. Borges has raised concerns internally with various authorities in the Chief Information Officer’s (CIO) office and to date has not been made aware of any remedial action. He therefore elevates his concerns out of a sense of urgency and duty to the American public,\" the  complaint states. “Should bad actors gain access to this cloud environment, Americans may be susceptible to widespread identity theft, may lose vital health care and food benefits, and the government may be responsible for reissuing every American a new Social Security number at great cost.” The approvals to copy the Numident database were, despite the enormous risk of that information falling into the wrong hands, approved expeditiously, according to the complaint. “I have determined the business need is higher than the security risk associated with this implementation and I accept all risks,” Moghaddassi wrote in a memo. Another senior DOGE official, Michael Russo, is alleged to have signed off on the decision in under half an hour. Before accepting his position as CIO, Moghaddassi worked for then-de facto DOGE boss Elon Musk at both Neuralink and X.In a statement to the New York Times, SSA spokesperson Nick Perrine said the agency was \"not aware of any compromise to this environment\" and that \"the data referenced in the complaint is stored in a longstanding environment used by S.S.A. and walled off from the internet.\"That DOGE should have access to sensitive data in the first place was the subject of tension within the federal government earlier this year. Several lawsuits attempted to block DOGE from accessing SSA, Treasury and Office of Personnel Management data. Via the so-called shadow docket, the Supreme Court struck down a Fourth Circuit injunction preventing the agency from siphoning SSA data in June. Among his other allegations, Borges claims DOGE regained access to the data during the injunction period.  This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/whistleblower-claims-doge-uploaded-social-security-data-to-unsecure-cloud-server-183500867.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Considering its popularity, Google Translate sure hasn't received much attention lately. However, that just changed with a big update. The latest app introduces AI-powered live translation along with new language learning tools that might give Duolingo a run for it's money.\nGoogle said it heard from users that the toughest skill to master was conversation — ie, learning to listen and speak with confidence. To that end, it's piloting a new language practice feature (on iOS or Android) targeted toward an individual's specific needs.\nTo create tailored listening and practicing sessions, the new learning tool posts a couple of questions. It first requests which language you want to learn (like Spanish) and your your current level, then asks \"What's motivating you to learn Spanish?\" From there, it will generate customized scenarios that allow you to either listen to conversations or practice speaking, with helpful hints available when needed.\n\nThe app was \"developed with learning experts based on the latest studies in language acquisition,\" Google explained in a blog post. To that end, it can track your daily progress to help build your language skills, possibly as an aid to Duolingo and other dedicated language learning apps. \"We see what we’re doing right now as really complementary to other things out there,\" Google product manager Matt Sheets said in a media roundtable. \"So whether you’re taking classes in a formal educational setting or doing immersion experiences, we think this is something that can work alongside of those.\"\nFollowing early testing, language learning is rolling out more widely as a beta experience for English speakers practicing Spanish and French, as well as Spanish, French and Portugese speakers working on English.\nGoogle also introduced AI-powered live conversations, a feature that builds on Translate's existing conversation feature by making it more seamless and adding more powerful models. It offers the ability to have a back-and-forth conversation in real time with audio and on-screen translations right inside the Translate app.\nIt's available in the Translate app for Android or iOS when tapping on \"Live Translate.\" First select the languages you want to converse in and being speaking. You'll hear the translation out loud and written in both languages on your devices. It will switch between the two languages spoken by you and the other party, identifying pauses, accents and intonations so you can have a natural conversation.\n\nLive translation uses Google's advanced Gemini voice and speech recognition models designed to help isolate sounds, so it works better than before in real-world environments like a noisy cafe or airport. The company noted that the new models helped it \"take huge strides in translation quality, multimodal translation and text-to-speech (TTS) capabilities.\" The new live translate mode supports 70 languages including Arabic, French, Hindi, Korean, Spanish, and Tamil and is now rolling out in the US, India and Mexico.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/apps/google-translates-latest-feature-is-its-take-on-duolingo-160035157.html?src=rss",

However, Bloober Team is staying the course with Cronos: The New Dawn, which is still set for September 5, and Rogue Factor is doing the same with Hell is Us (September 4).\nThese delays are reminiscent of reports that publishers and developers were putting off any fall release date announcements for their games for fear of getting crushed by Grand Theft Auto VI, which was supposed to be dropping by the end of the year. Rockstar has delayed its game until May but Devlover says it's not running scared of that particular blockbuster — it has committed to releasing a game on the same day as GTA VI.

    "summary": "There's a refresh of the popular Framework Laptop 16 available for pre-order right now, and it's a doozy. The new model is heavy on high-grade specs, with the inclusion of the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5070 GPU and AMD's Ryzen AI 300 Series processors.\nWe loved the modular nature of the previous iteration, but said the internals were a bit underpowered for serious gamers. It looks like that's been handled here.\n\nThe company has also made the NVIDIA-powered graphics module fully backwards compatible, so current owners of 2024's Laptop 16 can scoop that up instead of buying a whole new computer. The company promises a 30 to 40 percent increase in gaming framerates when compared to the Radeon RX module that shipped with the previous model.\nThe company also updated the thermal system, with a redesign of the fan blades to reduce noise. This was another major complaint we had with the last version, so it's a welcome change.\nFramework\nConsumers can choose from a couple of AMD Ryzen AI 300 Series variants. There are 8-core Ryzen 7 and 12-core Ryzen 9 options, both running at 45W sustained TDP. The mainboard module has been updated to allow support for four simultaneous display outputs and both storage and memory are upgradeable. Users can get the RAM all the way up to 96GB and the storage up to 10TB.\nThe new Framework Laptop 16 also ships with a redesigned power adapter, which will be the default adapter moving forward. This may be the first laptop ever with a 240W USB-C adapter, which should let users run the system at a sustained full load without too much of a battery drain.\nOther upgrades include a new webcam, a remade CNC aluminum top cover and several new keyboard designs. As previously stated, pre-orders are open right now. Prices start at $1,500 and shipments go out in November. The company has also reduced the price of the previous Laptop 16 iteration down to $1,300.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/the-latest-framework-16-modular-laptop-includes-the-nvidia-geforce-rtx-5070-150527564.html?src=rss",
