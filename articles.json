    "full_text": "Based on the study's findings, when an AI overview -- AIO -- appeared in search, users were less likely to click on links when compared to queries that didn't generate AI summaries. \"This analysis is a snapshot of what real Google users are doing in their day-to-day browsing.\" When an AIO does appear, nearly two-thirds of users either jumped to a different site or closed their Google Search page entirely, suggesting AI-generated results satisfy the search needs of users. Google also owns YouTube, which ends up driving traffic to one of its core online products. In instances of longer search queries, it more often triggered an AIO. \"This study uses a flawed methodology and skewed queryset that is not representative of Search traffic. We consistently direct billions of clicks to websites daily and have not observed significant drops in aggregate web traffic as is being suggested.\" Nearly 10,000 journalists have been laid off in the past three years, according to Nieman Reports. A judge declared that Google was operating an illegal monopoly in online search last year, and a federal court declared earlier this year that Google's online ads business is also an illegal monopoly. AI-generated summaries at the top of Google have been blamed in part for online publishers' recent traffic turmoil, although it's been difficult to definitively prove, as Google doesn't provide clear data on what traffic comes via AIOs in Search Console, a backend for sites to see Google Search metrics."

The electric-vehicle company, known more for self-driving cars and its headline-making CEO Elon Musk, announced its drive-in diner at located at 7001 West Santa Monica Blvd in Hollywood, California, is open for business. The place also serves as an electric vehicle charging station with 80 V4 Supercharger stalls, \"making it the largest urban Supercharging station in the world,\" according to the diner's website. But while you wait, you can nosh on a cup of Waygu beef chili with the fam from the diner or the comfort of your vehicle (maybe save the chili for in-restaurant dining to avoid any nasty spills). You don't have to drive a Tesla to eat there -- the charger stalls are open to all NACS-compatible EVs -- but you do need your Tesla touchscreen to order ahead and see what's playing next on one of the two 66-foot LED megascreens the two-story diner sports. Tech reporter Sawyer Merritt shared the menu prices, which include $13 for a hot dog and $15 for fried chicken and waffles. The diner is open 24 hours, offering breakfast options including breakfast tacos for $9 and avocado toast for $11. Musk said in a post on X that if the first foray proves a success, more diners could be coming to other cities around the world. CNET first reported in 2021 on Tesla's application for a patent for the Tesla name for use on goods and services, which included restaurants."

    "full_text": "is a news editor covering technology, gaming, and more. He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme. The former CEO of the company that marketed the sketchy-looking Escobar Fold 1 and Escobar Fold 2 phones — which you may remember from a 2020 video from Marques Brownlee — has pleaded guilty to fraud and money laundering, according to the US Department of Justice. In a plea agreement, United States attorneys detail how Olof Kyros Gustafsson and Escobar, Inc. took orders for the phones and other products branded with the likeness of the drug lord Pablo Escobar, seeded products with tech reviewers and social media influencers to “in order to attempt to increase demand,” did not deliver the products to customers, and transferred and laundered customer money to “use the funds for their own personal use.” In Brownlee’s video, he unboxed an Escobar Fold 2 phone shipped to him and found that it was just a Samsung Galaxy Fold — a phone that cost nearly $2,000, far more than the $400 Escobar Inc. was selling it for — with a gold sticker on it. Escobar Inc. also sold a $500 “Escobar Flamethrower” that was “modeled after” The Boring Company’s Not-A-Flamethrower, the $500 “Escobar Gold 11 Pro Phone” that was “marketed as a refurbished Apple iPhone 11 Pro,” and Escobar Cash that was “marketed as the world’s first ‘physical cryptocurrency,’” according to the plea agreement. Instead of sending products to paying customers, Gustafsson mailed them a “‘Certificate of Ownership,’ a book, or other Escobar Inc. promotional materials” to create a mailing record, the DOJ says in its press release. Then, when a customer tried to get a refund for something that wasn’t delivered, “Gustafsson fraudulently referred the payment processor to the proof of mailing for the Certificate of Ownership or other material as proof that the product itself was shipped and that the customer had received it so the refund requests would be denied.” A judge has scheduled a sentencing hearing for December 5th, where Gustafsson faces up to 20 years in federal prison for the fraud-related counts and up to 10 for the money laundering-related counts. Gustafsson must also pay as much as $1.3 million in restitution."

    "summary": "Welcome to Video Games Weekly on Engadget. Expect a new story every Monday or Tuesday, broken into two parts. The first is a space for short essays and ramblings about video game trends and related topics from me, Jess Conditt, a reporter who's covered the industry for more than 13 years. The second contains the video game stories from the past week that you need to know about, including some headlines from outside of Engadget.\nPlease enjoy — and I'll see you next week.\n\nThis week, I’m fried. Maybe it’s the plodding and ever-present crumbling of society and human decency, or maybe it’s because Love Island USA just ended so I’m feeling extra listless. It’s a familiar summer sensation, but this year everything is exaggerated and extra tense, the stakes of every action seem higher, and instead of melting into the warmth of the season with a popsicle and a smile, I often find myself frozen and numb. I am the popsicle, coo coo ca choo.\nI’m not sure exactly what I’m trying to convey here, but I think it’s clear that I shouldn’t be writing anything too serious at the moment. I’m working on a few reports and trying to keep my composure amid the chaos, and all the while, the video game headlines keep rolling on. I’ve included a few more than usual this week, as penance for my popsicle state.\n\nThe news\nThe Chinese Room escapes from Tencent\nUK studio The Chinese Room, creator of Still Wakes the Deep and Everybody’s Gone to the Rapture, is independent once again. The Chinese Room leaders completed a management buyout with help from VC firm Hiro Capital to fully split the studio from Tencent subsidiary Sumo Digital, which acquired it in 2018. A number of people were laid off as part of the transition and the studio is left with a total of 55 employees. The Chinese Room is still working on Vampire: The Masquerade — Bloodlines 2 for Paradox Interactive, and it also has original projects in development.\nStill Wakes the Deep was one of my absolute favorite games of 2024. Whether you’re a fan of beautiful paranormal horror or you're just really into oil rigs, give it a go.\nRead these stories that Vice censored\nVice’s owner, Savage Ventures, doesn’t want you to read this story. Or this one.\nVice removed two articles about Steam’s new ban on certain “adult-only” content and the organization that pushed for the change, Collective Shout, which has the support of prominent anti-pornography groups with conservative religious foundations. The stories were written by contributor Ana Valens, who said the removals were “due to concerns about the controversial subject matter — not journalistic complaints.” Valens has vowed to never write for Vice again and a handful of reporters there have resigned in solidarity.\nCensoring stories about censorship is certainly a choice, Vice.\nSupermassive delays Directive 8020 and shrinks its team\nThe home of Until Dawn and The Dark Pictures Anthology, Supermassive Games, is laying off 36 people, restructuring its team and delaying one of its projects into 2026. A statement from the studio says the decisions were in response to the video game industry’s “challenging and ever-evolving environment.” It’s estimated that Supermassive had more than 300 employees before the layoffs.\nDirective 8020, the fifth installment in the Dark Pictures Anthology, is now due to come out in the first half of 2026, rather than this fall. Honestly, I’m not surprised to hear Supermassive needs more time to work on Directive 8020. I watched Engadget UK bureau chief Mat Smith play the demo at Summer Game Fest in June, and while it looked great, we were both surprised by how short and non-interactive the segment was. He summed up this feeling in his preview with the line, “Finally, I got to play (but only for a few minutes).”\nSupermassive is also working on Little Nightmares III, a series that it took over from Tarsier Studios. Tarsier created Little Nightmares and its sequel, but lost the rights to the IP when the team was acquired by a subsidiary of Embracer Group in 2019. Series publisher Bandai Namco kept the Little Nightmares brand and commissioned Supermassive to build the third game, while Tarsier is working on its own project, Reanimal.\nIt makes sense that Supermassive would prioritize Little Nightmares III in order to fulfill its obligations with Bandai. The game has already been delayed once, and it’s set to hit PC and consoles on October 10.\nFBC: Firebreak is getting less busted\nI still have high hopes for FBC: Firebreak to be the Left 4 Dead revival we’ve always wanted, but fact is, it’s not quite there yet. Remedy Entertainment is aware of this hard truth and has a plan to fix it. The studio laid out its pipeline for making FBC: Firebreak easier to jump into, more fun to play and less confusing overall, with most major changes coming in an update this winter.\nValve is still the best retirement community in game development\nPCGamesN published an interview with Counter-Strike co-creator Minh Le, who left Valve years ago to try out independent development. One sentiment stuck out to me.\n“They didn't force me out or anything,” Le told PCGamesN. “But a part of me kind of regrets it. Looking back, my decision to leave Valve was, financially, kind of a poor decision. If I had stayed with Valve, I would have been able to retire by now.”\nIt’s not presented as an indictment of Valve, but I find it notable that Le describes the studio as a place to retire, rather than a space to innovate and create the next generation of video games. At this rate, Valve will never outrun its reputation as the studio where talented game developers go to die (professionally speaking). \nBut, hey, at least they're not getting laid off en masse. Which, unfortunately, brings us to the next headline.\nYour favorite studio’s favorite studio faces layoffs\nCyberpunk 2077, Sea of Thieves and Dune: Awakening support studio Virtuos is laying off 270 developers, which is about seven percent of its staff. Virtuos is currently best known as the studio behind The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remastered alongside Bethesda, and it has more than 4,000 employees across Asia, Europe and North America. The cuts affect developers in Asia and Europe, with “fewer than 10” in France, where work on Oblivion Remastered was headquartered.\nHeck yeah, there’s gonna be a Hellraiser game\nMake sure to pin this one on your calendar. Saber Interactive is making Clive Barker's Hellraiser: Revival, a first-person, action-survival horror game that features actor Doug Bradley as Pinhead for the first time in nearly 20 years. Barker himself provided input on the story, too. It’s coming to PlayStation 5, PC and Xbox Series X/S, with no release date yet.\n\"The Hellraiser universe is defined by its unflinching exploration of pain, pleasure, and the thin and terrifying line that separates the two,\" a description from Saber Interactive reads. \"That essence is at the heart of our game.\"\n\nAn inside look at the fallout of the Zenimax layoffs\nGame Developer reporter Chris Kerr spoke with a number of employees at Zenimax who are still reeling from the layoffs that Microsoft enacted in early July. The vibes there sound pretty terrible.\n“This carcass of workers that remains is somehow supposed to keep shipping award-winning games,\" one senior QA tester told Kerr. The developer continued, “Microsoft just took everything that could have been great about the culture and collaboration and decimated it. Morale is terrible. It's grotesque. People are stressed. They're crying.”\nXbox cloud play anywhere\nWhen Xbox isn’t firing thousands of employees in one blow, it’s quietly laying the groundwork for the future of video game distribution. An update for Xbox Insiders this week introduces cross-platform cloud support, bringing your cloud library and play history to the Xbox PC app. This means you can access cloud activity on an Xbox console, PC or Windows handheld, and seamlessly play cloud games across devices. This is just how video games are going to work in the coming decades, and it’s interesting to watch our future slowly roll out in blog posts and software updates.\nSubnautica 2 scandal catch-up\nDid you miss all of the mess around Subnautica 2 last week? Or, more accurately, this past month? To quickly summarize, Subnautica publisher Krafton is being sued by the series creators after it fired them and then delayed their game, allegedly sabotaging a $250 million bonus payout due to developers. To not-quickly summarize, see my complete breakdown of the drama.\nMy Melody & Kuromi hits Netflix this week\nI don’t know who else needs a little levity in their life right now, but I certainly do. Thankfully, the stop-motion show My Melody & Kuromi is coming to Netflix on July 24, and there’s already an adorable tie-in music video by LE SSERAFIM to enjoy. Zen out, watch all of the Sanrio sweetness and finally settle the debate: Are you more of a Kuromi or a My Melody?\n\nAdditional reading\n\nKris Holt's weekly indie game roundup\n\n\nHave a tip for Jessica? You can reach her by email, Bluesky or send a message to @jesscon.96 to chat confidentially on Signal.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/video-games-weekly-censorship-shrinkage-and-a-subnautica-scandal-221839722.html?src=rss",

The AI angle of Bee may be of particular interest for Amazon, especially as the company pushes its Alexa+ generative AI assistant.

The global licensing deal would reportedly be exclusive (sorry, current HBO Max viewers) and count five upcoming seasons and the show's back catalog. Not much else is known at this time for those interested in streaming it on Paramount Plus but we will update this article when there's more info. As for what the new season will include, we have the above trailer for reference -- which starts sort of like a horror movie trailer before unleashing fires, dismantling the Statue of Liberty and disastrous plane collisions. If you want to watch the 27th season of the show co-created by Trey Parker and Matt Stone, here's what to know. That's the current date after it was delayed from July 9.

(Jared's house, 1,200 square feet) 2.5 to 3 hours for a full vacuum and mop session on the main level. (Ajay's apartment, 850 sq ft): 16 to 18 minutes for initial mapping.

Without a fully operational and reliable OmniGrip arm, I can't justify its value for the cost at this time. \"The arm is a neat feature to watch but I personally don't find it very useful,\" said Jared."

This makes more sense once you consider a 2022 study that found 63% of Americans don't have vision insurance, as an eye exam, glasses and contact lenses can add up without it. If you don't have one either and are wondering if paying out of pocket for any of these services is worth it, you are not alone -- several Reddit users have been asking the same thing. Where is the most affordable place to get an eye exam and glasses? Many programs offer free eye care or low-cost options for those who qualify, including: You may also find opportunities to participate (for free) in college research studies. People who participate in both Medicare and Medicaid may have plan-specific options when it comes to finding low-cost eye care. Medicare is a program for adults over 65 and some people with disabilities. You may be able to get more extensive vision coverage through a Medicare Advantage program."

In many cases, people will only experience some of these symptoms when they have high cortisol. Cortisol tests are often performed using blood samples but can also be done through urinary analysis. As Barardo has said, \"This captures cortisol fluctuations throughout the day rather than at one single point in time.\" Vitamin C may be one of the top potential supplements to reduce cortisol and is readily abundant in several formats. \"Research demonstrates that vitamin C can reduce excessive cortisol production in response to both psychological and physical stressors.\" This plant is considered an adaptogenic herb, meaning it's believed to help the body manage and reduce stress responses. How much you should take will vary between these products, so checking the directions before use is essential. Cortisol supplements utilizing pterostilbene may be less common but should contain specific recommended intakes for each product if available. \"A healthy lifestyle that includes stress management practices can help maintain optimal cortisol levels naturally.\""

This acquisition signals Amazon’s interest in developing wearable AI devices, a different avenue from its voice-controlled home assistant products like its line of Echo speakers. Apple is rumored to be working on AI-powered smart glasses as well. These products come with a number of security and privacy risks, given that they record everything around them; different companies’ policies will vary in terms of how voice recordings are processed, stored, and used for AI training. Bee previously indicated that it planned to only record the voices of people who have verbally consented. Bee also says it’s working on a feature to allow users to define boundaries — both based on topic and location — that will automatically pause the device’s learning. The company noted that it plans to build on-device AI processing, which generally poses less of a privacy risk than processing data in the cloud. It’s not clear if these policies will change as Bee is integrated into Amazon, however — and Amazon has a mixed record on the handling of user data from its customers’ devices. Ring also settled claims in 2023 brought by the Federal Trade Commission that employees and contractors had broad and unrestricted access to customers’ videos."

The R2-4K is a significant improvement, capturing higher-quality video and improving the process of getting it onto your phone. The dash cam can record 4K video at 30 frames per second or 1080p at 60fps, and captures a 150-degree field of view, so you’ll get a clear image of what happened in front of you and some of what happened directly to your right and left. You can view video clips on the R2-4K’s 2.4-inch display, or transfer them to your smartphone over Wi-Fi using Rove’s app. The R2-4K comes with a suction mount and 3M sticky mount, both of which can be installed anywhere on your windshield. The dash cam needs to be connected to its power adapter with a USB-C cable (two are included), so make sure to mount it in an area where the cable won’t dangle and distract you. Under normal circumstances, the R2-4K will take a continuous time lapse recording and overwrite older footage once the microSD card is filled. However, you can push an “Emergency Lock” button to preserve a specific clip. The dash cam’s built-in G-Sensor will detect an impact and automatically lock that section of video."

The South Park team was locked in negotiations for months for what would have been a $3 billion, 10-year deal, according to previous reports. The show's 27th season was delayed to July 23 because of the behind-the-scenes maneuvering involving an ongoing acquisition of Paramount by Skydance Media. The TV series began on Comedy Central in 1997. Parker and Stone will take the stage at San Diego Comic-Con the day after the show's premiere on July 24 for a panel with Saturday Night Live alum Andy Samberg and Beavis and Butt-Head creator Mike Judge. What it means for TV viewers and the streaming industry \"While other parts of the media landscape are consolidating or trimming fat, Paramount is doubling down on exclusive IP to anchor its platform and compete for attention in a crowded market,\" Fairchild says. Viewers, Fairchild says, could increasingly rely on ad-supported tiers of streaming services if they feel they can't afford to access all the premium content they want across a fragmented field of paid streamers. Seth Schachner, a former Sony executive who is now managing director at Strat Americas, a Los Angeles consulting firm, said Paramount's deal \"looks like a very forward-looking one, closer to what Netflix might look to do than what a traditional studio would do.\" \"It would not surprise me if this agreement becomes a template for other big ticket programs which studios want to keep,\" he says."

Meta has also added creator-friendly tools, like the ability to add more links to profiles and more detailed analytics for the app.\nBut Meta has yet to clearly explain what it can offer creators in return. The platform is hardly driving any traffic to outside websites. It's also much harder to build a following on Threads, since the platform defaults to an algorithmic timeline consisting mainly of recommended content. This means that it's easier for a post from an unknown account to go viral, but viral posts rarely lead to an influx of new followers.\nMeta may simply be calculating that Threads already has enough momentum without paying people for viral content.

That followed the epic, messy implosion of its former owner, Embracer Group.\nIn the game, you'll play as a vault dweller taking on the dreaded Timekeeper and his ruthless army. It's set on a new planet, Kairos. It also introduces new gameplay mechanics (a grappling hook!), seamless world transitions (no loading screens) and fluid co-op (asynchronous difficulty levels). Best of all, it won't cost $80. Tone-deaf comments Pitchford made in May sparked speculation that the game might pull a Mario Kart World. (His magic failed him that day.)\nThe game first launches on PC, PlayStation and Xbox on September 12.

    "summary": "Gamers aren't usually known for their sartorial elegance. But that doesn't mean we don't deserve nice things. So after checking out a very utilitarian carrying case for the Switch 2, I wanted to explore the other side of things with a more lavish travel bag. And while Waterfield's Magnetic case for Nintendo's latest console certainly isn't the most rugged or affordable way to lug a handheld console around, it might just be the most luxurious.\nDesign: Drape me in this leather\nCompared to most Switch 2 travel bags that are made out of materials like plastic and polyester, Waterfield's case is an exercise in opulence. It's crafted from buttery full-grain leather that's softer than than a perfectly worn in baseball mitt or fancy Dior gloves. It really is that nice. \n \nI've been using the white leather model as I love how clean and simple it looks while still giving you that irresistible pillowy exterior. But for the kind of folk who get excited about patina, the chocolate model features a more distressed look that isn't afraid to show off oil, scuffs and blemishes. And if the need arises, you can always hit the case with hot air from a hair dryer to reduce the appearance of scratches.\nBut the thing that sets Waterfield's case apart from its competition is that instead of relying on a zipper, the pouch has a series of magnets to keep everything together. And honestly, there's just something really nice about not having any sharp objects near or around the case, so there's no fear of your Switch 2 getting nicked. This enclosure system also makes it super simple to thread a cable inside, allowing you to charge Nintendo's latest handheld without it needing to leave the safety of its case. On a practical level, I've also found that because taking the console in and out is so quick and easy, I'm much better about putting things back when I'm done gaming.\nThe obvious downside to this is that it's easier for stuff like sand to get inside and if you're storing tiny accessories like a microSD Express card, there's no real guarantee it won't fall out while you're in transit. Additionally, the trade-off for the case's fancy leather exterior is that it doesn't have the hard, rigid panels used in a lot of competitors, so it's not the most rugged travel companion. If you press down on the outside of the case, you can feel things like console's buttons and joysticks, so this definitely isn't something you'll want to cram into an already stuffed piece of luggage.\nOn the inside, Waterfield's case is lined with a plush microfiber fabric that will keep the Switch 2 nice and cozy. There are also two pockets for stashing small items like charging cables, game cartridges or Joy-Con straps. But I do mean small, because anything larger will cause the case to bulge, which may put undue stress on the console.\nOptional accessories\n\n\n\n\n   Sam Rutherford for Engadget \n \n\nThis case doesn't come with much in the way of bundled extras. Though like a lot of luxury products (just look at the options list on a Porsche or Ferrari), you can purchase additional accessories such as cord clips, AirTag holders and more. But the most important of these are Waterfield's game card holders, which are available in several sizes (4, 10 and 20). So I went and bought a 10-slot sleeve and it really is the perfect complement to the case. Cartridges fit snug and the holder itself nestles neatly into the pouch's built-in pockets. I just wish one came included, as you're looking at an extra $10 to $30 on top of an already pricey travel protector.\nWrap-up\nStarting at $90 for the nylon or waxed canvas models or $120 for the leather versions, Waterfield's Magnetic Case for the Switch 2 certainly ain't cheap. That's more expensive than Belkin's Charging Case, which comes with its own battery pack. And that's before you factor in a game card holder.\n\n\n\n\n   Sam Rutherford for Engadget \n \n\nBut the sheer suppleness of its leather and its super soft interior might be the comfiest cocoon Nintendo's handheld will ever experience. Then you add in a magnetic enclosure system and it feels like Waterfield has managed to transform a product that might normally be an afterthought into something that's a joy to use all by itself. So for those who want a travel pouch that looks and feels just as good as the console it's protecting (if not better), this case is in a class of its own.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/waterfield-magnetic-case-review-the-most-lavish-way-to-carry-your-switch-2-around-200052731.html?src=rss",

Don’t miss the 20th anniversary of TechCrunch Disrupt, and a chance to learn from the top voices in tech — grab your ticket now and save up to $675 before prices rise. As the company waits for federal approval, Rocket Lab and VPA are seeking permission to use a temporary method called “kedging” to ensure the first five hardware deliveries can arrive on schedule starting in September. But the dredging application and Rocket Lab’s separate kedging request suggest that it’s not hardware delays but maritime access that could be a bottleneck for the first launch. The company received permission for up to three beach barge landing test events — but these cannot take place between March 15 and August 31, so it is far from a long-term solution. Both filings highlight the importance of maritime access for Rocket Lab’s Virginia ambitions."

    "full_text": "Democrats already introduced legislation earlier this month to codify the rule, which would require subscription services to let customers cancel as easily as they signed up, through congressional vote. But now a group of lawmakers are also pressuring Republican FTC Chair Andrew Ferguson to reinstate it. It’s not yet clear whether either path toward restoring it will be fruitful, given that passing bills in a deeply divided legislature is a tall task, and Ferguson alongside Republican Commissioner Melissa Holyoak voted against the rule the first time around. But Democrats’ insistence on reviving it shows they believe it to be a politically winning consumer protection issue, a position some Republicans might also come around to. “A review of more than 16,000 comments from the public made clear what should be obvious: Businesses should not be allowed to trap consumers in costly subscriptions by making it difficult to unsubscribe—costing consumers valuable time and money while stifling competition,” the lawmakers wrote. “We urge the FTC to cure any perceived procedural defect and reissue the rule as quickly as possible to ensure consumers are protected from predatory subscription traps.” There’s some reason for hope that the FTC could get the rule back on track, even if it might look different than last time around. But that path forward still looks murky, especially in light of President Donald Trump’s upheaval of the FTC, an issue that’s still working its way through the courts. But Klobuchar and other Democrats aren’t looking at it as an either-or proposition. “The FTC should always be looking out for consumers and they did the right thing when they issued this rule,” Klobuchar said in a statement."

Honda has unlocked access to the Tesla Supercharger fast-charging network for the two electric SUVs and is now offering a Honda-approved adapter for connecting to any North American Charging System (NACS) DC fast-charging point. Pioneered by EV giant Tesla before being opened to the rest of the North American automotive industry in 2023, the NACS standard and charging connection has been rapidly adopted by nearly every automaker that sells or plans to sell electric cars in North America. Honda declared two years ago that it would be adopting NACS for its EVs starting in 2025, and today we see the fruits of that announcement. To connect to a Tesla Supercharger or other NACS DC fast-charging station, Honda is now selling an OEM-approved NACS-CCS adapter at authorized dealerships in the US and on the web at its Acura and Honda DreamShop online retailer. Third-party NACS-to-CCS adapters have existed for some time now, many of which are less expensive. However, Honda warns that damage to a vehicle caused by an unapproved adapter may void your EV's limited warranty. In addition to the new charging hardware, the Google dashboard software that's built into Prologue and ZDX EVs is also being updated to find and navigate to authorized Tesla Supercharger locations when people are searching for charging on the go. Owners will still need to install the Tesla Supercharger app on their smartphone to connect and pay upon arrival, but the automaker tells us that more seamless plug-and-charge capabilities are currently \"under development.\""

As I mentioned before, it includes a number of different ports, some of which are no longer in use but I prefer to have on hand. There are other, newer models with a different selection of ports. I also think the whole spin-the-disk-and-the-cable-disappears thing is a lot of fun. And a color other than black might have been nice. There are a lot of good desk-based adapters out there, but this one is great for popping into your backpack just in case you need it."

This goes live on July 31, allowing folks to juice up at more than 12,000 Supercharger stations throughout North America. Some of the company's vehicles can already use these charging stations, with the Gravity SUV gaining access earlier this year.\nThat leaves the Air line of luxury EV sedans. These vehicles will be able to roll up to a Tesla Supercharger for a top-off at the end of the month, but there are some major caveats. First of all, Lucid Air EVs will require an official adapter that costs $220, as they don't ship with a built-in NACS ports. This adapter won't work with V1 or V2 charging stations, which whittles down the convenience factor a bit.\nThere's another problem for Air owners. The adapter is limited to a 50kW peak charge rate, which provides around 200 miles of range per hour of charging. The Air can typically achieve a 300kW peak charge rate. Not only is this hobbled charge rate bad for Lucid Air devotees, it's also annoying for people that own other EVs. Remember, the Air will have to sit at the charger for an entire hour, which will increase traffic at the station.\nLuckily, there are other charging stations available that make use of that 300kW peak rate. Air owners can use stations by Electrify America, EVgo and ChargePoint for a quick jolt. It's good to know that the Tesla Superchargers will be there in a pinch, which could come in handy during a road trip.\n\n\nThe company also recently unveiled the 2026 lineup of Air EVs. There's the Lucid Air Pure, which is a relatively streamlined option. Prices for this one start at $70,900. The Lucid Air Touring boasts an estimated range of 431 miles per charge, which is a decent metric. It starts at $79,900. Finally, the Lucid Air Grand Touring is the baddest of the bunch, with an estimated range of 512 miles per charge.

Apple’s fourth iOS 26 developer beta has reintroduced Apple Intelligence-powered notification summaries for news and entertainment apps, MacRumors reports. The company temporarily switched off the feature earlier this year after botching some headlines and promised they would be available again in a future update. After installing the new beta, your iPhone will show a splash screen where you can choose to have your notifications summarized. On that screen, you can select News & Entertainment as a category to be summarized, though as part of that category, Apple warns in red text that “Summarization may change the meaning of the original headlines. Verify information.” The splash screen also notes that notification summaries are a beta feature and that “summaries may contain errors.” The new beta, which was released on Tuesday, also makes the Liquid Glass design elements a little more liquid, according to 9to5Mac. The company has been messing around with the translucency of Liquid Glass elements as part of its beta updates, and when I initially tried it with the first beta, I thought it was a wild change to my iPhone. Apple is set to launch a public beta of iOS 26 sometime this month. Last week, Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman said it would arrive “around the 23rd” of July."

    "full_text": "For the last few years, subscription gaming services like Apple Arcade and Netflix have offered mobile game developers something of a haven for high-quality, premium mobile games: a type of game that had become vanishingly rare following the rise of the microtransaction-stuffed free-to-play model. But as these services’ once enviable lineup of indie games dwindles, that haven appears to be shrinking. Both services offered an interesting value proposition: Pay a monthly subscription fee to get access to a library of premium games, with some of those games available as mobile exclusives. In addition to serving as a publisher, Netflix took the additional step of outright purchasing game studios like Oxenfree developer Night School Studio and Cozy Grove studio Spry Fox to make bespoke games for the service. Netflix is increasingly focused on games tied to its own content. In its most recent quarterly earnings report, the platform briefly extolled its continued investment in titles like Squid Game: Unleashed and Thronglets — games tied to Netflix-produced Squid Game and Black Mirror, respectively. While these services don’t share much about hard numbers, third-party reporting suggested that the majority of Netflix users never engaged with the platform’s gaming offerings. So far Apple has only purchased a single game studio to make content for Apple Arcade, though its retreat to more casual offerings follows a similar pattern as Netflix. The free-to-play model has conditioned users that spending money for gaming content can be optional. Casual games like Monopoly Go make money through in-game advertisements or opt-in consumer spending on microtransactions, and few traditional paid games outside of Minecraft are now able to break through that mindset."

Companies like Shopify and Duolingo have said they're going \"AI-first.\" Companies are eagerly selling the idea that AI is a gamechanger in every aspect of our lives, and while it certainly has its uses, not every bit of hype has merit. You can't stop marketing folks from trying to sell their products, but the administration can and should be a wise steward of public resources and the public interest. I expect we'll see proposals for new ways to deploy AI in government service. But this technology isn't magic, and it serves nobody (except whoever sold the AI) to give it jobs that then have to be redone by humans. President Trump has spent a decade promising to make America great again.

    "full_text": "It doesn't matter how many times you open and close the Galaxy Z Fold 7 phone -- it's highly unlikely to give out on you. Samsung Display (SDC) announced Tuesday that its latest foldable OLED panel \"remained fully functional after a 500,000-fold durability test,\" more than doubling its previous benchmark of 200,000 folds. Bureau Veritas, a French leader in testing, inspection and certification, tested the screen with 500,000 folds over a 13-day period at a temperature of 25°C (77°F). For those of you trying to wrap your head around the math, half a million folds translates to the average user folding their phone 100 times a day for 10 years, or prolific users doing 200 folds a day for 6 years. Samsung Display -- a separate company from Samsung -- says the durability results prove that \"durability is no longer a limiting factor in the lifespan of foldable smartphones.\" \"This new panel ... builds consumer confidence in foldable OLED durability.\" Bulletproof glass technology has helped Samsung Display develop its creaseless screens. SDC also added high-elastic adhesive to each screen layer, thereby enhancing fold recovery performance by four times the previous design. CNET reported last week that Apple has tapped Samsung Display to manufacture screens for Apple's first foldable iPhone, set to launch in summer 2026. Despite the hype around foldable phones, a CNET survey published on Tuesday showed 64% of people have no interest in buying one of these smartphones in the next year."

    "full_text": "Previously, she was a writer and editor at MUO. Amazon is acquiring Bee, a startup that puts AI on your wrist. Bee CEO Maria de Lourdes Zollo says on LinkedIn that the company is joining Amazon to help “bring truly personal, agentic AI to even more customers.” Bee makes a $49.99 Fitbit-like device that listens in on your conversations while using AI to transcribe everything that you and the people around you say, allowing it to generate personalized summaries of your days, reminders, and suggestions from within the Bee app. My colleague Victoria Song got to try out the device for herself and found that it didn’t always get things quite right. It tended to confuse real-life conversations with the TV shows, TikTok videos, music, and movies that it heard. When asked about Amazon’s plans to apply the same privacy measures offered by Bee, such as its policy against storing audio, Amazon spokesperson Alexandra Miller says the company “cares deeply” about customer privacy and security, adding that the company will work with Bee to give users “even greater control over” their devices when the deal closes. “We’ve been strong stewards of customer data since our founding, and have never been in the business of selling our customers’ personal information to others,” Miller says. “We design our products to protect our customers’ privacy and security and to make it easy for them to be in control of their experience — and this approach would of course apply to Bee.” Miller also says the terms of the deal are “confidential,” and all Bee employees have “received offers to join Amazon.”"

When you have your yarn, tap the Plush-O-Matic -- the machine that looks like a giant Pokeball -- and you'll be able to make plushes with your yarn. Then tap Make and you can choose which yarn to create a Pokemon plush with. However, I can't see a way to make one particular Pokemon. For example, when you select Fiery Yarn, you can tap Plush Rates in the bottom right corner of your screen to see what Pokemon that yarn can create. After you've woven your Pokemon plush, it's time to decorate. Tap and hold the hourglass to rewind your room, kind of like an Undo button. To do so, tap Shop in the top left corner of your screen and you can buy different bundles. It's unclear if you can solve a limited number of puzzles every day without issue, or if you'll have to buy the Basic Pack at some point to continue playing.

It's an interesting change from the Gen 6 games, where mega evolutions were only encountered in battles against gym leaders and similarly powerful trainers. Legends: Z-A brings back Lumiose City's fashion scene, detective work Detective work in Legends Z-A appears to be a system for accepting quests from people around the city who need help with their problems, like trash Pokemon hanging out on restaurant tables outside. Today's Pokemon Presents also gave us some new details on Pokemon Champions, the upcoming battle-focused game that will be available on both Switch and mobile devices. The game seems to be pretty exclusively a battle simulator, and we've now learned that it allows you to pull in your teams from Pokemon Home or recruit new Pokemon either temporarily for free or permanently by using in-game currency.

It'd be fantastic to turn over a new leaf and get good looking, polished Pokemon games on the Switch 2."

    "full_text": "Boycotters believe that Etsy is in violation of its policy, as the company notes that prohibited behavior includes not only hate speech, but also “content which directly or indirectly contains violent or degrading commentary against protected classes listed above.” Some Etsy sellers worry their online businesses will suffer as a result, even though they are not selling this type of merchandise. Because the effort is so far only loosely organized, it’s difficult to tell how many are participating. Etsy is not alone in profiting from this type of merchandise, as some sellers and buyers have also pointed out. Many major selling platforms have not banned “Alligator Alcatraz”-branded products at this time. eBay responded to an email request, but never shared a comment. Shopify didn’t respond, nor did smaller platforms like Redbubble and TeePublic. Walmart told TechCrunch it has clear guidelines around prohibited products, and those that don’t comply are “promptly removed.”) Etsy also featured a couple of sellers with pro-“Alligator Auschwitz” branded merchandise, among other listings for merchandise calling for its abolition (as seen in the screenshot below). But in more extreme cases, the companies have capitulated to customer backlash."

Amazon Metal rack with skewers Depending on what you're cooking and the size of your air fryer, a double rack can add more cooking space and allow you to cook more than one type of food at a time. This handy metal claw-like gripper is great for lifting hot dishes out of the air fryer that don't feature a built-in handle. They work especially well with pans and bowls that have a lip. Muffin holders Make delicious muffins, rolls or egg bites in this silicone baking accessory. The seven-cup mold is compatible with air fryers baskets that are 5 quarts or larger. The holders are also nonstick, ensuring easy removal after cooking. If you want to try cooking an entire roast chicken in your air fryer or any other meats, the thermometer will let you know when the food has reached a safe temperature to eat."

Julia Garner as Shalla-Bal, aka Silver Surfer in The Fantastic Four: First Steps. No, it's not like what you've seen in Wakanda or Loki, and the '60s vibes allow for some cool gadgets and the First Family's vehicle. Though the Fantastic Four's backstory is quickly highlighted through vibrant flashbacks and discussions about how they obtained their abilities on a mission gone wrong, it's not clear if there were any global threats and villains (like Red Ghost) before they became superheroes and Earth's assigned guardians. Their first meeting doesn't go as one would hope, and things get urgent when Sue and Reed refuse to hand over their child in exchange for sparing the planet. Watching the Human Torch set things on fire and the whole gang take on Silver Surfer -- in outer space -- not only gives us a taste of the danger they face, but also lets each character shine as part of a family of intelligent superhumans who care deeply about one another. We still don't learn much about his origins or motivations, but it serves as the great big bad for this story and gives these charismatic, heart-first heroes a chance to show off their powers and humanity. Make sure to watch the post-credits scenes for some more Marvel hints and Easter eggs."

There are several ways to use a vibration plate, the most common being standing on its rectangular platform. However, experts agree that vibration plates offer the most benefits when used as part of an overall health and wellness plan. In other words, you shouldn't expect to lose weight or increase muscle strength just by standing on a vibration plate -- even if social media makes it seem so. \"The vibrations may also be disconcerting to people who have inner ear problems or balance abnormalities.\" \"You're going to experience much more muscle activation when doing it on a vibration plate machine.\" Scoot forward until you're hovering in front of the platform, only supported by your arms and legs. While it's true that vibration plates offer some compelling benefits, they aren't a shortcut to fitness. To get the best results from your vibration plate training, experts also recommend following a healthy diet and participating in other forms of exercise."

This includes long-distance running endurance predictions to help you train for that looming 10K.\nIn addition to the updated heart rate and sleep tracking, the Watch 3 Pro is also capable of blood oxygen (SpO₂) monitoring, stress tracking, guided breathing exercises, hydration and inactivity reminders, as well as women’s health tracking.\nOn-wrist ChatGPT integration allows you to ask questions and set reminders using \"natural language\" voice prompts, and there’s a voice recorder with autotranscription for when you want to quickly log a mid-run thought.

Battery life is 13 days with \"typical\" use, which Nothing says is a two-day improvement over its predecessor. If you're hitting the tracking hard you can expect around 11 days of juice on a full charge. With the always-on display enabled, battery life unsurprisingly takes a significant hit to around 4.5 days.\nNothing says the Watch 3 Pro and all other smartwatches in the CMF lineup now use the Nothing X app, with the new control centre promising improved stability and a more intuitive UI. It also plays nice with Strava, Apple Health, and Google Health Connect\nYou’re getting a fair bit of bang for your buck, then, but we’ll have to wait and see how the Watch 3 Pro fares against pricier alternatives where everyday performance is concerned. When TechRadar reviewed the Watch 2 Pro earlier this year, it had lots of positive impressions of the watch, but noted some spotty fitness tracking and sensor detection. 9to5Google was even more critical, finding fault with the heart rate tracking and concluding that the product felt unfinished. And while the Watch 3 Pro covers a lot of the bases for fitness watches with its various sensors, it still lacks NFC for payments, which could be a deal-breaker for some people.\nAvailable in Dark Grey, Light Grey, and Orange colorways, the CMF Watch 3 Pro costs $99 (a not insignificant $30 bump on the Watch Pro 2) is available to buy now.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wearables/nothings-99-cmf-watch-3-pro-offers-better-battery-life-and-ai-fitness-coaching-151058055.html?src=rss",

He said people sign up to try out these features, but retention numbers are low because of a lack of personalization, and that’s why startups like Cloaked can come in.

VSCO’s first new app in more than a decade, Capture focuses on taking pictures with a set aesthetic. The app has more than 50 presets for images along with some real-time effects. The app also lets users sync all photos with VSCO’s cloud. The Freelance Photographer offers various courses, starting from $208 per month for the basic coaching plan, and a $625 per month that gives subscribers access to over 50 tools, several courses, and personal mentoring from the company’s founder, Paul Weaver. The acquisition fits neatly into VSCO’s aim of catering more to professional photographers. Last year, the company launched VSCO Hub, to enable brands to discover photographers for different projects, and VSCO Sites, which lets photographers create web pages to show off their work. In May, the company launched VSCO Canvas, a collaborative whiteboard product that lets users create moodboards for different projects."

They’re here to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge. Khan said Nevoya’s automation has been getting information to drivers faster, with fewer mistakes than humans would make. He also said that leveraging AI is not replacing dispatchers, but rather freeing them up to better communicate with Nevoya’s customers. He also said Nevoya has to be more creative with how it manages its fleets in places like Texas because there is less charging infrastructure. These locations get extra revenue during off-peak hours, and Nevoya gets to expand quickly with lower up-front cost. To manage this expansion, Khan said Nevoya is leaning on the same model that companies like Uber used as it entered new locations. As Xu saw Nevoya progressing, he remembered saying to Khan: “What would it look like if you actually raised a lot more than you were expecting to raise?” The two spoke about using more artificial intelligence to optimize their fleet management, while also keeping an eye on an autonomous future (hence the inclusion of Applied Intuition’s Younis in the round)."

    "full_text": "Owners of the Lucid Air sedan will be able to charge their luxury EVs at thousands of Tesla Supercharger stations in North America starting July 31, nearly two years since the automakers reached an agreement. But there is a notable caveat: Lucid Air vehicles won’t be able to charge as fast as Tesla vehicles. Lucid said on Tuesday that all Lucid Air sedans, regardless of model year, will be able to access Tesla’s network of fast chargers with an approved adapter that costs $220. Tesla V3 (and above) Supercharger stations are compatible with the Lucid Air adapter. However, the Air will only be able to charge at 50 kW, a far lower rate than the 250 kW peak rate that these Superchargers provide. Lucid spokesperson Andrew Hussey explained that engineers repurposed hardware in the Air’s integrated charging system, called Wunderbox, to make the system work and activate 50kW boost charging when using a Supercharger. He added that Lucid views the 50kW charging for Air as another option for owners who are on road trips, or live or work closer to Superchargers. The CCS was considered the go-to EV charging standard in North America and used by all automakers, with one notable exception. In May 2023, Ford became the first automaker to reach an agreement with Tesla that would give its EV owners access to the Supercharger network. Lucid was among the last companies to strike a deal with Tesla."

Some accessories come in hard plastic or hard shell designs for extra durability, while others double as a sleek protective case or minimalist tag holder.

If you're comfortable slipping an AirTag into an interior pocket of a bag or coat, you can do so without an extra accessory. But if you want to use one to keep track of your keys, wallet, backpack or even your pet on their collar, you'll need an accessory that can accommodate that use case.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-apple-airtag-cases-holders-accessories-123036404.html?src=rss",
    "full_text": "AirTags can also help you keep track of larger bags and luggage, and you could easily slip one into an interior pocket and call it a day. But if you’d rather hook the tracker to the outside, you’ll need something a bit larger and more flexible than a standard key ring. Belkin’s Secure Holder with Strap is a good option: it comes in different colors and it’s budget friendly at only $13. The case opens up into two pieces, allowing you to sit the AirTag inside the circle and twist and snap the two halves together to lock it in. You can then attach the AirTag to your luggage handle, dog collar, water bottle or other item with the strap, which feels quite strong. I appreciate the unique design of Belkin’s Secure Holder, although it was hard to twist open when the AirTag was inside of it. But that’s a good thing for daily use; your AirTag isn’t going anywhere when in the Secure Holder. I also liked its slightly raised edges, which provide extra protection against impacts and bumps."

That means, unfortunately, that big discounts are few and far between, and they’re often the first to sell out when sales do arise. But make no mistake: you can find good Apple deals across the web, you just have to know where to look.\nEngadget keeps track of deals like these regularly, so we’re here to help. We’ve collected the best Apple deals on items like AirPods, MacBooks, iPads and more that you can get right now. Just note: you’ll find the best Apple deals from retailers like Amazon, Best Buy, Walmart, Target and others — not directly from Apple. Unless you shop refurbished, you’ll always pay top dollar direct at Apple, and for some things (like iPhones), that might be the best route to take.  \nBest Apple Watch deals\n \nApple Watch SE for $169 (32 percent off): We wouldn’t be surprised to see an update to Apple’s budget smartwatch sometime soon (and we have a few suggestions on the matter). But thanks to some serious discounts, the Apple Watch SE has turned out to be the most affordable way to get an iPhone companion for your wrist. Despite the lackluster screen and limited extra features, it handles the basics well. Also at Best Buy and Walmart.\nBest AirPods deals\n \nBest iPad deals\n \niPad Pro (M4, 11-inch) for $899 ($100 off): The most powerful iPad is the iPad Pro, and it’s the one to get if you’re even toying with the idea of using your new slab as a laptop replacement. Both the 11- and 13-inch models have gorgeous displays, thinner and lighter designs, a repositioned front camera and the excessively powerful M4 chip inside. Also at Best Buy. \nBest MacBook deals\n \nApple MacBook Air (15-inch, M3, 24GB RAM) for $1,299 ($400 off): The last-gen M3 MacBook Air has officially been discontinued, but it remains a superb laptop while the last bits of stock remain available. We gave this 15-inch model a score of 90 in our review — outside of its slower chip (which is still plenty fast for everyday use), marginally improved camera and inability to power two external displays with the lid open, it's virtually identical to the newer version. This deal applies to the model with the larger 24GB of memory in the Starlight colorway. \nMacBook Air (M3, 15-inch) for $949 ($350 off): The base model M3 MacBook Air is also available at a sizeable discount..\nApple MacBook Air (15-inch, M4) for $1,049 ($150 off): The 15-inch MacBook Air is nearly identical to the smaller version but features more robust speakers and a more spacious trackpad alongside its roomier display. Also at B&H.\nBest Apple accessories deals\nApple Pencil (USB-C) for $69 ($10 off): This more affordable Apple Pencil doesn’t support pressure sensitivity, but it still makes for a useful stylus for the basics. If you’re a casual note-taker and can live without wireless charging, you’ll save a few bucks by picking this one up. Also available at Walmart.\nApple Pencil (2nd gen) for $90 ($39 off): The Second gen Pencil both attaches and charges magnetically, supports tilt and pressure sensitivity and allows for tool changes with a tap of the flat edge. It’s an older pencil and isn’t compatible with the latest iPad models. This is the lowest price we’ve tracked this year, but it went as low as $80 for last year’s Black Friday sales.\nRead more Apple coverage:\n\nThe best AirPods\nThe best Apple Watches\nThe best MacBooks\nThe best iPhones\nThe best iPads\n\nFollow @EngadgetDeals on X for the latest tech deals and buying advice.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/best-apple-deals-150020110.html?src=rss",

Apple MacBook Air (15-inch, M4) for $1,049 ($150 off): The 15-inch MacBook Air is nearly identical to the smaller version but features more robust speakers and a more spacious trackpad alongside its roomier display. If you’re a casual note-taker and can live without wireless charging, you’ll save a few bucks by picking this one up. This is the lowest price we’ve tracked this year, but it went as low as $80 for last year’s Black Friday sales. Follow @EngadgetDeals on X for the latest tech deals and buying advice."

Now there's an actual trailer filled with gameplay footage and it looks pretty nifty.\nDeveloper Alexander \"Red888guns\" Berezin is the brains behind the project and he used the GZDoom engine to recreate the ghoul city of Necropolis from Fallout 1 as an FPS that resembles the newer games. The art style is pretty incredible in this trailer and looks to be a highlight of the project. Take a look for yourself.\n\nThis doesn't look like a full mod of the entire game, as that would be quite the undertaking. Rather, it reimagines the Necropolis section.

This reminds me of the first installment of the Final Fantasy VII remake that was entirely set in Midgar.\nUnfortunately, we have some time to wait before we get our hands on this mod. The trailer indicates a release date in 2027. There's also the Bethesda-sized elephant in the room. Who knows if the company's lawyers will go on a letter-writing spree to get this project shut down. \nReally been pushing Alexander to make sure we've got a living, breathing, retro-futuristic (but sometimes seedy) world for NB RPG.

This can be used to purchase anything on the platform and is available with every color and both the 256GB and 512GB versions of the Z Fold 7.\nWe strongly recommend going for the 512GB model, as the two storage options are the same price ($2,000) during this pre-order period.

We were so impressed with our review unit that we placed the gadget at the top of our list of the best foldable phones. It's a remarkably thin device, with a sleekly-designed hinge that stays out of the way when opened.\nThe 200MP main camera is fantastic, the specs are unparalleled and both displays are gorgeous. We called it a \"stunning device\" in our official review, going on to praise the 120Hz refresh rate of both screens and the peak brightness of 2,600 nits. We said that the displays \"pop a touch more\" compared to rivals like the Pixel 9 Pro Fold.\nThe main downside here is the price.

    "summary": "If you’ve been shocked by how much you spend on streaming services lately, you’re not alone. Companies like Netflix, Disney, HBO Max and others have been consistently raising prices to the point where you may question if streaming is even worth it anymore. We at Engadget still think it is, but we also think you should be smart with your money — and that’s where streaming deals come in.\nYes, it is possible to get discounts on services like Peacock and Paramount+, even if those deals aren’t as common as a sale on AirPods. If you’re looking to save money and still stream all of the content you want, Engadget can help by laying out the best streaming deals you can get right now, how you can save with bundles and everything you should know before paying for yet another streaming service. \nBest streaming deals\nTrue streaming deals can be hard to come by. Most often, they’ll pop up during the Black Friday shopping period. On occasion, we’ll see them sparingly throughout the year and they usually take the form of a discounted monthly or annual rate for a limited period of time. Also, true streaming deals are typically on the ad-supported versions of a service, but once in a while you’ll find a unicorn of a deal on a tier that has ad-free viewing.\nIf you’re able to wait for a deal before subscribing to a streaming service, we recommend doing so. You’ll save money upfront and in the long run, and you also have the option to cancel your subscription before the price goes back up to the normal rate. Maybe you find you like the service so much that you’re fine paying full price for it — that’s the ideal situation. But if you’re not compelled to keep that app on rotation in your smart TV, most streaming services make it easy for you to cancel at any time. With that said, these are the best streaming deals you can snag right now.\n \nSpotify Premium Individual (1 month) for $0 ($12 off): This is our favorite music streaming service for podcasts and social features. Right now, users who have not signed up for Spotify's Premium service before are eligible to get one month for free. The Premium Individual plan lets you listen ad-free and skip songs at will. You can also organize your listening queue and download content for offline listening. Just be aware, your subscription will auto-renew at the end of the trial period. So if you don't want to be on the hook for the $12 monthly fee, set a reminder to cancel and go back to the free version.\nSling Orange for $23/month for the first month (50 percent off): New customers can get Sling Orange or Sling Blue for half off the usual price for the first month, bringing the final prices to $23/month and $25.50/month, respectively. Orange is likely best for sports fans, with eight exclusive sports and family channels, while Blue includes 19 exclusive news and entertainment channels. You can get both Orange and Blue access also for half off for one month, or $33 total.\nYouTube TV (two months) for $120 ($46 off): You can get two months of our favorite live TV streaming service for $60 per month which works out to $46 less than paying the full $83 each month. And right now, the service is free for the first 21 days. That should give you a decent chunk of time to see if the service is right for you. The discount and trial are only open to new subscribers to YouTube TV’s base plan, which includes access to over 100 channels, unlimited DVR space and six household accounts with the ability to stream on three devices at once. The deal ends July 31.\nFubo Pro for $65/month for the first month ($20 off): Fubo has introductory discounts on most of its packages, and the Pro package is the least expensive plan currently listed. It offers access to 224 channels, unlimited cloud DVR and up to 10 simultaneous streams. It even includes regional sports content from the NHL, MLB and NBA.\nSling TV + MLB.TV for $30 off: New subscribers can get $30 off their first month of Sling TV when they sign up and add MLB.TV to their package. The offer applies to Sling Orange, Sling Blue and Sling Orange & Blue, and MLB.TV gives you access to MLB Network along with access to all out-of-market games during the regular season. This offer runs through May 31.\nHBO Max student discount — subscribe for $5/month (50 percent off): HBO Max offers their ad-supported tier to students for half off the usual rate. You’ll just have to verify that you’re a student through Unidays, and make note that this offer is only good for up to 12 months of service.\nHulu student discount — subscribe for $2/month (75 percent off): Those with a valid student ID can get Hulu’s ad-supported tier for 75 percent off the typical rate. They’ll keep the same sale price for as long as they’re a student as well.\nSpotify student discount — Premium + Hulu with ads for $6/month (72 percent off): Spotify’s student offer continues to be one of the best around, giving you access to the Premium tier of the music streamer and Hulu’s ad-supported plan for only $6 monthly. Purchased separately, you’d pay $22 per month for both of the services. Plus, the first month is free when you sign up.\nNBA League Pass student discount — one year for $120 (40 percent off): Students can get one year of League Pass for only $10 per month, which includes access to NBA TV and the ability to watch classic and archive games on-demand. On the NBA League Pass website, look for the student discount banner at the top and follow the instructions to verify your student status.\nPeacock first responders discount — one year for $48 (50 percent off): Medical professionals and first responders can save 50 percent each year of Peacock. The deal requires annual verification and is open to those who work for either private or public institutions. Peacock has some great stuff to watch, including Poker Face and Killing It and more.\nStreaming bundle discounts\nThere’s more consolidation happening now than ever before in the streaming space, and that means there are more streaming bundle options. These bundles offer you access to more content with one subscription price, but those prices are typically higher than paying for a single service by itself (obviously). It may be tempting to just get the bundle, but if only one of those services in the bundle speaks to you, you’ll spend less overall by just paying for the single service.\nSpeaking of a deep love for a single streaming service: if all of your favorite shows are on Peacock or the latest releases on HBO Max consistently bring you joy, consider paying for one year upfront. Subscribing with an annual plan usually saves you money in the long term over paying on a monthly basis. Unfortunately, not all streaming services (looking at you, Netflix) have an annual subscription option. Here are some of the best streaming bundles you can get right now.\n \nDisney+, Hulu, HBO Max bundle with ads for $17/month: Ad-supported HBO Max is included here, along with full, ad-supported access to Disney+ and Hulu. You’ll save 43 percent with this bundle, as opposed to paying for all three services individually.\nDisney+ and Hulu Bundle Premium for $20/month: Disney and Hulu offer a few different bundles, which you can view in the drop-down lists under Choose Your Plan. This bundle removes the ads from both Disney+ and Hulu (with the exception of select live and linear content) and allows you to download content for offline viewing. You’ll save 42 percent with this bundle, as opposed to paying for both ad-free tiers individually.\nParamount+ with Showtime for $13/month or $120/year: This includes everything in Paramount+’s Essential plan, except the ads, and also provides access to Showtime content, live CBS streams and download features.\nSling TV + HBO Max starting at $53/month: Sling TV and HBO Max have partnered on a discount that gives new subscribers 50 percent off their first month of Sling TV, plus $5 off monthly when you subscribe to the Sling TV + HBO Max bundle. The standard price for the Sling Blue + HBO Max duo is roughly $58/month, so you'll get a monthly discount of $5 off that. In addition, for the first month only, you'll get half off the price of the bundle. The promotion also applies to the Sling Orange & Blue + HBO Max package, which has a standard price of $73/month.\nHulu + Live TV with Disney+ and ESPN+ for $96/month: This streaming bundle amalgamation is a bit confusing but it does offer a lot: you get live TV streaming via Hulu’s service plus access to the following VOD services: Hulu, Disney+ and ESPN+. Out of those three, only ESPN+ will have ads.\nDisney+, Hulu, ESPN+ Bundle Basic for $17/month: You get full access to Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+ content with this package, albeit with ads across the board. This bundle price is 46 percent off the total price of all three separate subscriptions.\nDisney+, Hulu, ESPN+ Bundle Premium for $27/month: Similarly to the Duo bundles, the Premium version of the Trio removes ads from most content in Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+, and you can download content for offline viewing. This price represents a 43-percent savings when compared to paying for all three ad-free tiers separately.\nRead more streaming coverage\n\nThe best live TV streaming services to cut cable\nThe best streaming services: Netflix, Hulu, HBO Max and more\nThe best streaming devices\n\nFollow @EngadgetDeals on X for the latest tech deals and buying advice.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/best-streaming-service-deals-133028980.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "If your PlayStation 5’s internal storage is starting to feel a little cramped, you’re not alone. With game installs regularly taking up over 100GB, expanding your storage is one of the easiest ways to get more out of your console. The best SSD for PS5 will not only give you extra space for your game library, but it should also meet Sony’s speed requirements so your games load just as fast as they would on the built-in drive.There’s a wide range of SSDs to choose from, whether you want a simple plug-and-play option with a heatsink or a budget-friendly pick where you add your own. Some offer better cooling, others come with software tools for managing performance — but all the drives we’ve included here are compatible, fast and reliable. Here’s what to look out for when upgrading your PS5 storage, and our top picks to help you get started.Read more: These are the best SSDs in 2025\nTable of contents\n\nBest SSDs for PS5 in 2025\nHow we test PS5 SSDs\nPS5 SSD FAQs\n\nBest SSDs for PS5 in 2025\n \n \n \n \nHow we test PS5 SSDs\nI’ve tested most of the SSDs recommended on this list, either for PS5 or computer use. I also bought and used our top pick in my own PS5. \nPS5 SSD FAQs\nHow much PS5 storage do I need?\nThe PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 5 Pro can accept internal drives with between 250GB and 8TB of storage capacity. If you already own a PS5, chances are you have a reasonable idea of how much storage you need ​​for your game library. If you’re buying an SSD with a new PS5 or PS5 Pro, or buying for someone else, it’s more difficult to tell what you might need for a high-performance experience.\nPS5 games are smaller on average than their PS4 equivalents, typically taking up between 30GB and 100GB, with some notable (and very popular) exceptions. If you’re a fan of the Call of Duty series, installing Black Ops 6 and Warzone 2.0 can eat up to 240GB. In other words, a full Call of Duty install will take up more than one-third of the PS5’s internal storage. If you’re not a CoD fan, though, chances are you’ll be good to store between six to 10 games on a regular PS5 internally before running into problems.\nYou also need to consider your internet speed. If you live in an area with slow broadband, the “you can just download it again” rationale doesn’t really work. At my old home, a 100GB download took me around eight hours, during which time it was difficult to simultaneously watch Twitch or, say, publish articles about upgrading PS5 SSDs. Keeping games around on the off-chance you’ll want to play them at some point makes sense.\n\n\n\n\n   Aaron Souppouris / Engadget \n \n\nOff the bat, there's basically no point in going for a 250GB PS5 SSD. Economically, 250GB drives aren’t that much cheaper than 500GB ones — and practically, that really isn’t a lot of space for modern games to live on. 500GB drives can be a decent option, but after years of declining prices, I think the sweet spot for most people is to opt for a high-capacity 1TB or 2TB drive, which should run you at most $200. The latter will more than double the PS5 Pro’s storage without breaking the bank.\nUnless you’re rolling in cash and want to flex, 4TB and 8TB models should mostly be avoided, as you’ll end up paying more per gigabyte than you would with a 1TB or 2TB drive.\nWhile the 825GB PS5 only provides 667GB of storage, that’s largely due to storage being reserved for the operating system and caching. If you install a 1TB PS5 SSD, you'll have, within a margin of error, 1TB of storage available for games. Out of the box, the PS5 Pro offers 1.86TB of storage for games, though you can eke out more if you delete the pre-installed Astro’s Playroom (gasp).\nSince neither the PS5 Slim nor PS5 Pro feature updated CPU architecture, all of our recommendations will work with whatever PS5 model you own.\nCan you play PS5 games on an external SSD?\nExternal hard drives tend to cost less than internal SSD counterparts (and there’s a good chance you might own one already). Unfortunately, there are restrictions on what you can do with them. An external SSD connects to your PS5 via USB, and is only suitable for playing PlayStation 4 games, or storing PS5 titles. That’s useful if you have anything but the best high-speed internet — it’s faster to move a PS5 game out of “cold storage” on an external drive than it is to re-download it — or want to keep your PS4 library on hand.\nDue to the limitations here, you don’t need the highest-performing model, although you should opt for SSDs over HDDs for improved transfer speeds and load times. Any basic portable drive from a reputable brand will do, with the Crucial X9 Pro and Samsung T7 being options we’ve tried and can recommend.\nWhich SSD cards are compatible with the PS5?\nThe official answer to this question is an “M.2 Socket 3 (Key M) Gen4 x4 NVME SSD.” But even within that seemingly specific description, there are additional factors to consider. The main requirements Sony has laid out for compatibility come down to speed, cooling and physical dimensions.\nFor speed, Sony says drives should be able to handle sequential reads at 5,500MB/s. Early testing showed that the PS5 would accept drives as slow as 4,800MB/s, and that games that tap into the SSD regularly — such as Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart — would cause no issues. Pretty much the only thing the PS5 will outright reject is one that doesn't match the Gen4 x4 spec.\nIn our opinion, though, using a drive slower than the specification is a risk that, if you don’t already have that drive lying around, is not worth taking. Just because we haven’t found issues yet doesn’t mean there won’t be games that could be problematic in the future. The price difference between these marginally slower Gen4 drives and the ones that meet Sony’s spec isn’t huge, and you might as well cover all your bases.\nSlightly more complicated than speed is cooling and size. Most new SSDs are going to be just fine; the PS5 can fit 22mm-wide SSDs of virtually any length (30mm, 40mm, 60mm, 80mm or 110mm, to be precise). The vast majority of drives you find will be 22mm wide and 80mm long, so no problem there.\nIt should be noted that the system can fit a 25mm-wide drive, but that width must include the cooling solution. Speaking of, Sony says SSDs require “effective heat dissipation with a cooling structure, such as a heatsink.” The maximum height supported by Sony’s slot is 11.25mm, of which only 2.45mm can be “below” the drive.\nThis previously meant some of the most popular heatsinked Gen4 SSDs, including Corsair’s MP600 Pro LP, would not fit within the PS5’s storage expansion slot. Since Engadget first published this guide in 2021, most NVMe makers, including Samsung, have come out with PlayStation-specific models that meet those requirements. That said, if you want to save some money, bare drives are often cheaper and it’s trivial to find a cooling solution that will work for the PS5.\nThe only component in an NVMe SSD that really requires cooling is the controller, which without a heatsink will happily sear a (very small) steak. Most SSDs have chips on only one side, but even on double-sided SSDs, the controller is likely to be on top, as manufacturers know it needs to be positioned there to better dissipate heat.\nSo, head to your PC component seller of choice and pick up basically anything that meets the recommended dimensions. A good search term is “laptop NVME heatsink,” as these will be designed to fit in the confines of gaming laptops, which are even more restrictive than a PS5. They’re also typically cheaper than the ones labeled as “PS5 heatsinks.”\nOne recommendation is this $6 copper heatsink, which attaches to the PS5 SSD with sticky thermal interface material. It works just fine, and in performing stress tests on a PC, we couldn’t find anything metal that didn’t keep temperatures under control. When you’re searching, just make sure the solution you go for measures no more than 25mm wide or 8mm tall (including the thermal interface material) and has a simple method of installation that’s not going to cause any headaches.\nOne last thing: When shopping for a PS5 NVMe, there’s no reason to buy a Gen5 model over a more affordable Gen4 model. As things stand, Sony’s console can’t take advantage of the new standard, and though Gen5 drives are backward compatible, they’re more expensive than their Gen4 counterparts. Just buy the fastest and highest-capacity Gen4 model you can afford.\nHow to install an SSD into your PS5\nIf you need guidance on how to install your new NVMe into your PS5 or PS5 Pro, we have a separate guide detailing all the steps here. Installation is pretty straightforward, but our how-to can help you if you're stuck. Just make note: Before attempting to add more storage via a PS5 SSD, ensure that you have Sony’s latest software installed.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/best-ssd-for-ps5-130004175.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Choosing the best Android phone can feel overwhelming as there are so many options from so many brands, it’s hard to know where to start. Unlike Apple, which sticks to its sleek lineup of iPhones, Android offers a world of variety. Whether you're eyeing the latest flagship from Samsung, a budget-friendly smartphone from Motorola or something unique with a foldable design, there’s an Android device out there to suit your needs.The beauty of Android is its flexibility. You’ll find phones with different screen sizes, camera setups, battery life and even quirky extras like stylus support or rugged builds. Plus, Android lets you customize your device to your heart's content – something Apple fans might envy. We’ve tested and researched the top Android phones to help you find the right one for your budget, lifestyle, and tech preferences.\nBest Android phones for 2025\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhat to look for in a new Android phone\nPerformance\nWhen it comes to picking our favorite Android phones, the main things we look for are pretty straightforward: good performance (both compute and AI), a nice display, solid design, sharp cameras, long battery life and a significant commitment to ongoing software support. For performance, not only do we look at benchmarks and other metrics, but we also evaluate phones based on responsiveness. Regardless of whether you’re reading, text messaging, scrolling through social media or playing a game, no one wants a gadget that feels sluggish. \nDisplay\n\n\n\n\nWhen it comes to displays, we generally prefer OLED panels that can produce rich, saturated colors with at least 600 nits of brightness, though many of our top mid-range and high-end phones can hit 1,000 nits or more. And more recently, most of our favorite devices also support screens with fast refresh rates of 90Hz or 120Hz, which adds an extra level of smoothness and fluidity.\nDesign\nNow we will admit there is a bit of subjectivity when deciding which phones look the best, but there are other design aspects like dust and water resistance or screen durability that can make a big difference to long-term survival. It’s also important to consider things like support for wireless charging, power sharing (aka reverse wireless charging) and UWB connectivity, which can have an impact on how your phone interacts with your other devices.\nCameras\nObviously, for photos we’re looking for sharp, colorful shots in both bright and low-light conditions. And we want video clips with high dynamic range, rich audio and smooth image stabilization. Extra cameras for ultra-wide and telephoto lenses are a plus. The best cameras should also include features like dedicated night modes, support for various video recording resolutions, and additional photo modes like timelapse, slow motion and more.\nBattery and software\nFinally, in terms of longevity, we’re looking for all-day battery life on devices that also delivered great results on our local video rundown test (at least 16 hours on a charge, but more is obviously better). Wireless charging capabilities have become almost ubiquitous over the past few years, and most of our top picks have this extra perk. Fast-charging is available on some Android phones, too. Finally, with people holding onto their phones longer than ever, we like to see companies commit to at least three years of software support, upgrades and regular security updates.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/best-android-phone-130030805.html?src=rss",
    "full_text": "Processor: Google Tensor G4 | Display: 6.3-inch Super Actua, up to 120Hz | Cameras: Rear array (50MP wide, 48MP ultrawide with Macro Focus, 48MP 5x telephoto lens), 42MP dual PD selfie front camera with autofocus | Battery: 4,700mAh But it was always a little too big and too cumbersome for those of us who have smaller hands or want our phones to fit in our pockets. Instead of a relatively large 6.8-inch screen like that on its bigger sibling, the standard Pro has a 6.3-inch display that is easy to maneuver. Better yet, with the Pixel 9 Pro, Google hasn't sacrificed any key feature to get to the smaller size, meaning you'll find the same camera setup and performance in both handsets. But the Pixel 9 Pro is also much longer-lasting than the XL, notching almost 25 hours on our battery test. Those distinctions aside, the Pixel 9 Pro lineup is our favorite Android phone because of its top-notch camera performance, intriguing AI features and a general grown-up vibe. While previous Pixel flagships had a colorful, blocky design that felt fresh, this year's devices feel solid and refined. Without the camera bars, they would be pretty hard to tell apart from Apple's phones. The Pixel 9 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro both start at $999, and though some of us have come to think of Google's handsets as the more competitively priced option, this year's model might be good enough to justify a premium price. If you still want something from the Pixel 9 family but don't want to pay $1,000, the base Pixel 9 is still a solid handset for most people."

And, wow, I wasn't quite ready for the emotional journey this one took me on. It's set in a near future — people ride OneWheels and going viral on social media is still a thing some strive for — where the megacompany CWC has created an extreme form of high-speed travel that allows people to zip across the world in no time flat. But, it soon becomes pretty clear that there's a consequence for this. Earth is spinning faster and faster… and faster, and protestors blame CWC and the orbital circuit its travel system relies on. The days grow shorter, the climate events become more extreme and everything is hurtling toward disaster. Circular Motion follows Tanner, a kid from smalltown Alaska who lands a job at CWC, Winnie, a girl who has truly been through it, and Columbia professor Victor Bickle, who shot to viral fame after predicting a public infrastructure catastrophe. They're all connected, as we piece together through multiple POVs. This is a book that very blatantly has something to say about capitalism, climate change and everything in between, and a beautiful exploration of human connection in a crumbling world."

    "summary": "We've been busy in the Engadget reviews department over the last few weeks, keeping up with Prime Day, product launches and the accumulating stack of devices on our desks. If you missed any of our in-depth testing recently, you can quickly catch up on the latest camera, laptop, phone and soundbar reviews in the list below. \nSamsung Galaxy Z Fold 7\n \nSamsung made notable design changes on its latest flagship foldable phone, finally giving the masses a significant update after a series of iterative models. Senior reviews writer Sam Rutherford argued the company \"has finally achieved foldable phone nirvana\" thanks to the reductions in overall size and thickness on the Z Fold 7, making the niche handset appeal to more users. \"With its latest flagship foldable, Samsung has removed one of the remaining barriers preventing people from trying out the new breed of phones: excessive size and weight,\" he said. \nCanon R50 V\n \nContent creators who are just getting into vlogging will soon realize they need a camera more robust than their phone for better quality footage. Reporter Steve Dent explained that Canon's EOS R50 V excels at video, thanks in part to its quick autofocus, but the camera lacks the performance and features of its rivals. \"Canon’s R50 V is a pretty good first try for a vlogging camera, hitting the mark in key areas like video quality and usability,\" he wrote. \"However, its rival, Sony’s ZV-E10 II, beats it in nearly every area, offering even better video quality, higher photo resolution, faster autofocus, smoother electronic stabilization and neat features missing on the R50 V — like the product showcase.\"\nSamsung HW-QS700F\n \nLike the Z Fold line, Samsung has been on a streak of iterative updates for its flagship soundbars. For 2025 though, the company debuted an all-new model that automatically detects how you're using it and adjusts the speaker output appropriately. It's that trick, along with crisp sound, that makes the QS700F a contender even with its constrained 3.1.2-channel audio. \"Caveats aside, the best thing about the soundbar is its automatic orientation adjustment,\" I noted. \"The QS700F is easy on the eyes too, which isn’t always the case with these devices.\"\nPanasonic S1 II\n \nThe S1 II may be Panasonic's best camera for content creators, but there's one major downside: the price. Steve's assessment of this model's features, which include 6K RAW video and best-in-class stabilization, will help you weigh the potential $3,200 investment. \"Panasonic’s S1 II is a powerful hybrid camera, and if it wasn’t so expensive, it would be a no-brainer for creators,\" he said. \"However, Nikon’s Z6 III has nearly the same video capabilities, is a better camera for photography and costs at least $600 less, so I’m inclined to recommend that model for most users.\"\nDell 16 Plus 2-in-1\n \nThe Dell 16 Plus 2-in-1 is the company's first consumer laptop to feature its recently updated naming scheme, and the change in moniker is accompanied by refreshed styling. Sam explained that while the machine is perfectly capable, especially with the optional LED display, it's lacking personality. \"It's a totally serviceable machine, but it doesn't have a single trait or feature that endears itself to its user,\" he wrote. \"Same goes for its name.\"\nBelkin Charging Case for Nintendo Switch 2\n \nNow that the Switch 2 is out in the wild, Nintendo's handheld console needs protection. Sam put the Belkin Charging Case through its paces to find out if it's a worthy accessory. \"I kind of wish Belkin sold a version that doesn't come with a battery for anyone who wants to use their own power pack,\" he said. \"The company’s non-charging version of this case isn’t an ideal alternative as it doesn't have much extra space inside. But even so, this kit offers a solid combination of price and practicality, which is all I'm ever really asking for.\"This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/engadget-review-recap-galaxy-z-fold-7-panasonic-s1-ii-samsung-qs700f-and-more-123027122.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Welcome to our weekly roundup of the goings on in the indie game space. It's been quite the busy spell, with several notable games debuting or landing on more platforms and some intriguing upcoming projects popping above the parapet.\nThe Steam Automation Fest is taking place this week (it runs until July 21 at 1PM ET), so fans of games like Satisfactory and Factorio might be looking to pick up some bargains on similar titles. As well as offering a variety of discounts, Automation Fest also saw the debut of several new games.\n\nOne of them is from a studio formed by the original team from the celebrated developer Zacktronics. The first title from Coincidence (with the help of publisher Astra Logical) is Kaizen - A Factory Story. This puzzler is set in 1980s Japan, and you're tasked with building popular electronics of the day, including calculators, arcade cabinets, personal computers and toy robots.\n\nDawn Apart also arrived during Steam Automation Fest. This is a blend of space colony sim and automation sandbox set in a destructible, voxel-based world. Astra Logical is also publishing this project, which is from Industrial Technology and Witchcraft. Dawn Apart is available now on Steam in early access.\nOther new releases\n\nOne of the highest-profile indie games to debut this week is Neon Abyss 2, from Veewo Games and Kepler Ghost. The original game has sold more than a million copies, so plenty of people will have been looking forward to the sequel. This time around, you can play with up to three friends in co-op. The game's creators are promising \"unlimited item synergies\" here, which is handy since there's an onus on creating overpowered builds in this action roguelike. Neon Abyss 2 is out now on Steam in early access.\n\nReady or Not has been a hit on Steam since it arrived there in late 2023, and now Void Interactive's tactical first-person shooter has made the leap over to PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S. Here, you'll lead a team of SWAT officers in an attempt to restore order to a city that's become overrun by corruption and chaos. You can play the 18-level campaign solo or with up to five friends.\n\nBack to the Dawn is a story-driven RPG from Metal Head Games and publisher Spiral Up Games that's now out of early access on Steam. It has also arrived on Xbox Series X/S and Game Pass. \nAs Thomas the Fox, you're an investigative journalist who has been framed for revealing government secrets and tossed into prison. You'll have to forge alliances with other prisoners in your attempt to break out.\nAs part of Back to the Dawn's full launch, Metal Head is introducing a new character, Bob the Panther, as well as a fresh storyline. I like the art style here, and the premise is pretty compelling.\n\nThinking is cool and all, but sometimes you just want to turn down the volume on your brain and shoot a bunch of stuff. Kickback is an arcade bullet hell shooter with a fun twist: you can only move while you're shooting and, as the tile suggests, you'll be propelled backwards. I'm into it. Kickback — from Dot blood and publisher Targem Games — is out now on Steam.\n\nI'll be honest, I had no idea what Fretless - Wrath of Riffson was when I got an email from Steam this week telling me that this game, which I apparently had placed on my wishlist at some point, is now available. But hey, that name is an absolute winner.\nI appreciate the pixel art look of this turn-based RPG from Ritual Studios and publisher Playdigious Originals. According to the Steam page, you'll play \"as Rob, a friendly musician trying to restore harmony in an off-tuned world where wacky villains are corrupting music.\" That sounds quite lovely, actually.\nUpcoming\n\nI have absolutely no idea how Strange Scaffold does it. The studio behind I Am Your Beast, the brilliantly unsettling Clickolding and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown is about to unleash its seventh game in the space of two years. Co-Op Kaiju Horror Cooking is Strange Scaffold's first co-op game.\nThe trailer makes it look delightfully chaotic, as players rush to cook meals to satiate giant monsters and stay alive. Co-Op Kaiju Horror Cooking is out on July 29, but until then you can play the entire game for free as part of a playtest.\nWhat's more, Strange Scaffold has announced two more games: Truck-kun is Supporting Me From Another World?! is a \"chaotic anime-inspired vehicular action game about driving into objects at high speed to rescue the corporate ladder climber you accidentally isekai'd into a dangerous medieval fantasy world\" while Space Warlord Baby Trading Simulator is a \"fast-paced stock market sim about buying, selling, and shorting stocks based on the simulated lives of adorable alien children.\"\nBeautiful one-line pitches. Zero notes. Can't wait for those, or to find out about another new game demonstrating a \"unique method of developer collaboration\" that Strange Scaffold plans to unveil next week. \n\nIf you're hankering for more first-person parkour in a similar vein to Mirror's Edge, Neon White or Ghostrunner, Jetrunner might just do the trick. Riddlebit Software's platformer-shooter hybrid, which is published by Curveball Games, is coming to Steam on September 4. It looks like it could be fun! If the announcer's voice in the trailer sounds familiar, that's because the character is played by Matthew Mercer.\n\nI missed this one last week, but I just want to very quickly mention Ghost Haunting. The world needs more funny point-and-click adventures in the vein of those classic LucasArts games. Three Headed Monkey Studios and publisher Daedalic Entertainment have made a positive first impression to suggest they're ready to take that particular baton. There's no release date or window as yet, but this was an instant addition to my wishlist on Steam (let's just hope I don't forget about this one, eh?)\n\nI would love to play a tour manager simulator game at some point, getting into the nitty gritty of making sure gigs and everything else involved in a band's life on the road goes smoothly. Rockbeasts is not quite that, but it still seems like it could be a good time.\nThis is a \"grungy\" narrative-driven rock band management game from Lichthund and Team17. The trailer is fun and there are some interesting talents involved here. Rockbeasts was written by writer Jakub Szamałek, who was senior writer of The Witcher 3 and principal writer of Cyberpunk 2077. Even cooler is that Iggy Pop voices on of the characters, who is named Iggy Pup. Love it.\nRockbeasts is coming to PC and consoles next year.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/neon-abyss-2-a-prison-break-rpg-and-other-new-indie-games-worth-checking-out-110043805.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "If I had to describe the status of Subnautica 2 in just three words, it would be these: messy, messy, messy. That’s not to say the game itself is in terrible shape — this is actually a pivotal claim in the whole situation — but the relationship between Subnautica series developer Unknown Worlds and its parent company, Krafton, is in shreds. This month alone, Krafton fired the founders and CEO of Unknown Worlds, Subnautica 2 was delayed until 2026 and the ousted leaders filed a lawsuit against Krafton, looking to regain creative control of the game and the studio. At the center of the conflict is a bonus payment worth up to $250 million.\nHere’s a rundown of how we got here and what in the devil is going on with Subnautica 2, Krafton and Unknown Worlds.\nKrafton\nCharlie Cleveland accidentally started Unknown Worlds in 2001 while building the popular Half-Life mods Natural Selection and Natural Selection 2, and technical director Max McGuire came on as an official studio co-founder in 2006. Inspired by Minecraft and burned out on mods, Unknown Worlds began working on the undersea, open-world exploration game Subnautica and released it in early access on Steam in 2014. With years of community feedback, the game evolved into a singularly tense and rich survival experience, and version 1.0 officially landed in 2018. This is also when Ted Gill joined the studio’s executive team, freeing up Cleveland to focus on creative direction. Subnautica and its spin-off, Subnautica: Below Zero, attracted millions of players and established Unknown Worlds as a successful independent team.\nSo, the larger studios came sniffing. PUBG publisher Krafton, which operates with billions of dollars annually, purchased Unknown Worlds in 2021 for $500 million. The acquisition came with the promise of an additional payout worth up to $250 million if Unknown Worlds hit certain performance goals by the end of 2025. This bonus is a critical piece of the chaos today.\nWe know more about the details of this deal thanks to recent reporting by Bloomberg. In addition to the leadership positions, which were filled by Cleveland, Gill and McGuire, Unknown Worlds had about 40 employees at the time of the Krafton sale, and they received payouts totaling $50 million at closing and over the following two years. This larger group was poised to receive as much as $25 million in the 2025 performance-based earnout, with each person expecting a different amount, but most estimating six or seven figures. The remaining $225 million was reserved for the Unknown Worlds leadership, but they said they intended to share a portion of their windfall with employees who weren’t included in the bonus, covering the full studio headcount of about 100 people.\nKrafton\nThe leadership of Unknown Worlds repeated this promise in a lawsuit filed against Krafton on July 10, 2025. But we’re getting ahead of ourselves.\nAfter the acquisition, Unknown Worlds continued updating Subnautica and Below Zero. In February 2024, the studio released Moonbreaker, a turn-based strategy game that never really took off, partially because of its initial microtransaction system. Since then, the studio has been focused on Subnautica 2. The game was officially announced in October 2024 with a prospective early access launch window of 2025. It’s currently the second-most wishlisted game on Steam, after Hollow Knight: Silksong.\nThe first public notion that something was rotten between Unknown Worlds and Krafton came on July 2, when Cleveland, Gill and McGuire were fired and replaced by former Callisto Protocol studio head Steve Papoutsis. Krafton didn’t provide a reason for the switch-up in its press release, instead offering the following nearly complete thought: “While Krafton sought to keep the Unknown Worlds’ co-founders and original creators of the Subnautica series involved in the game’s development, the company wishes them well on their next endeavors.”\nKrafton didn’t mention delaying the early access launch at this time, but it implemented a review process that it said would be “essential to delivering the right game at the right time.” The publisher suggested the ousted leaders had been uncooperative in this aspect.\n“Unknown Worlds’ new leadership fully supports this process and is committed to meeting player expectations,” its press release said.\nCleveland published a blog post on July 4 reflecting on his time in game development, and sharing his disappointment at Krafton’s handling of Unknown Worlds and Subnautica 2. He also referenced Krafton’s intent to delay the launch.\n“You can see why for Max, Ted, myself, the Unknown Worlds team, and for our community, the events of this week have been quite a shock,” Cleveland wrote. “We know that the game is ready for early access release and we know you’re ready to play it. And while we thought this was going to be our decision to make, at least for now, that decision is in Krafton’s hands. And after all these years, to find that I’m no longer able to work at the company I started stings.”\nOn July 9, Krafton officially delayed the early access launch of Subnautica 2 to 2026. That same day, Bloomberg published a report outlining the performance-based bonus agreement and implicitly questioning how the timing of the delay would make it difficult for the studio to hit its goals, putting the payout in jeopardy. This was the first time the details of the bonus became public.\nKrafton shared a statement with Engadget — and in a pop-up on its own homepage — on July 10 that straight-up accused the fired leaders of abandoning the studio in favor of personal creative pursuits, specifically calling out Cleveland’s film production company. It also threw shade at Moonbreaker and claimed the former bosses wanted the bonus payment “for themselves.”\nKrafton\n“Krafton made multiple requests to Charlie and Max to resume their roles as Game Director and Technical Director, respectively, but both declined to do so,” the statement said. “In particular, following the failure of Moonbreaker, Krafton asked Charlie to devote himself to the development of Subnautica 2. However, instead of participating in the game development, he chose to focus on a personal film project. Krafton believes that the absence of core leadership has resulted in repeated confusion in direction and significant delays in the overall project schedule. The current Early Access version also falls short in terms of content volume.”\nThat same day, Cleveland announced that he and the other ousted studio heads had filed a lawsuit against Krafton.\n“Suing a multibillion dollar company in a painful, public and possibly protracted way was certainly not on my bucket list,” Cleveland wrote. “But this needs to be made right. Subnautica has been my life’s work and I would never willingly abandon it or the amazing team that has poured their hearts into it. As for the earnout, the idea that Max, Ted and I wanted to keep it all for ourselves is totally untrue.”\nThe lawsuit wasn’t unsealed until July 16. But on July 15, Bloomberg reported that Krafton now planned to extend the window for the bonus payment by an additional year, giving the studio more time to hit its goals. The publisher will also reportedly advance a portion of a separate profit-sharing bonus pool to all Unknown Worlds employees in 2025.\nThese moves seem designed to moot the core issues raised in the breach of contract complaint that Cleveland and other Unknown Worlds leaders filed against Krafton in Delaware Chancery Court. The lawsuit, unsealed on July 16, claims Krafton illegally fired the studio heads and delayed Subnautica 2 in order to avoid the bonus payments. It also provides a timeline of growing tensions between the founders and Krafton this year, accusing the publisher of intentional sabotage.\nThe lawsuit claims that Krafton and Unknown Worlds had a respectful relationship until April 2025, when Gill presented Krafton executives with the studio’s positive revenue projections, which were made with the assumption that Subnautica 2 would hit early access in 2025. He also outlined the expected bonus payout under the agreement.\n“When that happened, everything changed,” the lawsuit reads.\nThe complaint alleges that at this point, Krafton began looking for ways to force out the leaders of Unknown Worlds and delay the launch of Subnautica 2, with a goal of circumventing the bonus payment. Cleveland, Gill and McGuire argued back and forth with Krafton executives over whether the game was ready for early access, and Krafton eventually pulled all of its resources from the studio. Krafton issued a stop order on Subnautica 2 development, took over Unknown Worlds’ communications channels and in June it started laying an internal paper trail accusing the founders of abandoning their fiduciary duties, according to the complaint.\nCleveland, Gill and McGuire were fired and removed from the Unknown Worlds board of directors on July 1. This is where the rest of us entered the story.\n\nThe main conflict here is over whether Subnautica 2 is really ready for an early access launch, and that matters because of a potential $250 million bonus payment that’s jeopardized by a delay. Not only is this a large sum for Krafton to lose, but it’s also a massive amount of money for Cleveland, Gill and McGuire to miss out on, especially now that they’ve lost their studio and tentpole IP. The ousted leaders reiterated in their lawsuit that they “planned to share even more of the earnout with their dedicated team” than they were contractually obligated to. In the complaint, they’re looking for Krafton to pay out the full bonus as projected without a delay, fulfill its obligations as a publisher and reinstate them as the heads of Unknown Worlds.\nEvery party in this situation claims they want what’s best for Subnautica 2 and its players. It’s possible that they’re all telling the truth and this is a simple disagreement over artistic integrity. It’s also possible that they’re all lying and everyone is looking to make (or keep) a quick buck — but man, that’s bleak. The truth, as usual, likely lies somewhere in between and, chances are, we’ll never know it. At least the court system will eventually be able to determine the second-best thing, which is who’s at fault.\n\nHave a tip for Jessica?

Labor strikes — including the recently resolved SAG-AFTRA video game strike — have made securing protections against AI a central issue. The Oscar-nominated film The Brutalist came under fire in 2024 for using AI tools during production.

The guidelines provide a framework for the EU's AI Act, which regulates companies operating in the European Union.\nThe EU's code of practice is voluntary, so Meta was under no legal obligation to sign it. Yet Meta's Chief Global Affairs Officer, Joel Kaplan, made a point to publicly knock the guidelines on Friday. He described the code as \"over-reach.\"\n\"Europe is heading down the wrong path on AI,\" Kaplan posted in a statement. \"We have carefully reviewed the European Commission’s Code of Practice for general-purpose AI (GPAI) models and Meta won’t be signing it.

It previously called the AI Act \"unpredictable,\" claiming \"it goes too far\" and is \"hampering innovation and holding back developers.\" In February, Meta's public policy director said, \"The net result of all of that is that products get delayed or get watered down and European citizens and consumers suffer.\"\nOutmuscling the EU may seem like a more attainable goal to Meta, given that it has an anti-regulation ally in the White House.

It also requires developers to provide regularly updated documentation describing their AI features.\nAlthough signing the code of practice is voluntary, doing so has its perks.

    "summary": "We tested all the major live TV streaming services and, after comparing the features and costs, we still think they are a better deal than paying for cable or satellite — but the gulf between the options is narrowing. Now that most subscriptions go for more than $80 per month, live TV streaming is not the amazing deal it once was.Still, there’s no contract, the pricing is simpler and you don’t need any special equipment beyond a smart TV and an internet connection. Our current top choice is YouTube TV; It’s the most well-rounded option that should please anyone looking for live sports, linear cable-style channels and/or local networks. But other services have their advantages, too, depending on what you want to watch. Here are the best live TV streaming services according to our tests.\nTable of contents\n\nBest live TV streaming services for 2025\nBest free live TV streaming services for 2025\nWhat to look for in a live TV streaming service\nHow we tested\nLive TV Streaming FAQs\nRecent updates\n\nBest live TV streaming services for 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to top \nBest free live TV streaming services for 2025\nThere are plenty of ways to get free TV these days. To start, many standard streaming apps have added live components to their lineups. You’re paying for the service, so it’s not technically “free,” but you can get a dose of live TV without spending more than necessary. Peacock includes some regional NBC stations, and notably access to the 2024 Summer Olympic Games. Paramount+ subscribers can watch on-air CBS programming. The standard Hulu app has a live ABC news channel and Max now includes a live CNN outlet with its service, along with cable-like linear channels.\nThe smart TV operating system (OS) you use likely provides free live content too: Amazon’s Fire TV interface has a live tab and Roku’s built-in Roku Channel includes hundreds of live channels at no extra cost. The same goes for Samsung TV Plus, which added a trove of K-dramas to its free live and on-demand lineup in 2024. The PBS app offers local live streams of its channels — even NASA has a free streaming service with live coverage. \nBut for a full suite of live TV networks, and don’t want to sign up for any paid service, there are a number of free ad-supported TV services that have live TV. Even cable company DirecTV has joined the crowd with MyFree, and Fubo Free lets customers with a lapsed subscription keep watching some content. Here's the best of the live TV streaming services we tried:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to top\nWhat to look for in a live TV streaming service\nHow to stream live TV\nStreaming live TV is a lot like using Netflix. You get access through apps on your phone, tablet, smart TV or streaming device and the signal arrives over the internet. A faster and more stable connection tends to give you a better experience. Most live TV apps require you to sign up and pay via a web browser. After that, you can activate the app on all of your devices.\nMonthly Price\nWhen I started testing these cord-cutting alternatives, I was struck by the price difference between live TV and a standard video streaming app. Where the latter cost between $5 and $20 per month, most live TV services hit the $80 mark and can go higher than $200 with additional perks, channel packages and premium extras. The higher starting price is mostly due to the cost of providing multiple networks — particularly sports and local stations. And, in the past year or so, every service except Sling has raised base plan prices.\nLocal channels\nOnly two of the services I tried don’t include full local channel coverage for subscribers and one of those makes no effort to carry sports at all. That would be Philo and, as you might guess, it’s the cheapest. The next most affordable option, Sling, only carries three local stations — and only in larger markets — but it still manages to include some of the top sports channels.\nWhen you sign up with any provider that handles local TV, you’ll enter your zip code, ensuring you get your area’s broadcast affiliates for ABC, CBS, FOX and NBC. Of course, you can also get those stations for free. Nearly all modern television sets support a radio frequency (RF) connection, also known as the coaxial port, which means if you buy an HD antenna, you’ll receive locally broadcast stations like ABC, CBS, PBS, FOX and NBC. And since the signal is digital, reception is much improved over the staticky rabbit-ears era.\nBut local channel access is another area where traditional streaming services, like Netflix, are bleeding into broadcast territory. For example, you can watch your local NBC station with a Peacock subscription and you can tune into your area’s CBS station through your Paramount+ subscription. Netflix is even getting into the mix with a recently announced deal with one of France’s broadcast companies, TF1. The streaming service will now air TF1's live TV channels and on-demand content inside the Netflix app. No word if the concept will expand to other regions, but it’s an interesting move to anyone interested in the future of streaming.\nLive sports coverage\nOne reality that spun my head was the sheer number and iterations of sports networks in existence. Trying to figure out which network will carry the match-up you want to see can be tricky. I found that Google makes it a little easier for sports fans by listing out upcoming games (just swap in NBA, NFL, MLB, NHL and so on in the search bar). When you click an event, the “TV & streaming” button will tell you which network is covering it.\nThat just leaves figuring out if your chosen service carries the RSNs (regional sports networks) you want. Unfortunately, even with add-ons and extra packages, some providers simply don’t have certain channels in their lineups. It would take a lawyer to understand the ins and outs of streaming rights negotiations, and networks leave and return to live TV carriers all the time. That said, most major sporting events in the US are covered by ESPN, Fox Sports, TNT, USA and local affiliates.\nI should also point out that traditional streaming services have started adding live sports to their lineups. Peacock carries live Premier League matches, Sunday Night Football games and aired the 2024 Olympic Games from Paris. Thursday Night Football as well as NBA and WNBA games are on Amazon Prime and Christmas Day Football aired on Netflix. Max (formerly HBO Max) now airs select, regular season games from the NHL, MLB, NCAA and NBA with a $10-per-month add-on. You can watch MLS games with an add-on through the Apple TV app, and Apple TV+ includes some MLB games. Roku users can watch the just-added free sports channel and those who subscribe to Paramount Plus can see many of the matches aired on CBS Sports, including live NFL games. This year, even the Super Bowl was live-streamed for free on Tubi. While all of these alternatives may not cover as much ground as live TV streamers, they could end up being cheaper avenues to the sports you want.\nAnd if sports is all you’re after, there are sports-only plans that are a touch cheaper, too. The promised sports streaming service from ESPN, Fox and Warner Bros. called Venu was cancelled early this year. But in May, ESPN confirmed it will launch its own streaming service that will include all ESPN channels, though a start date hasn’t been confirmed. DirecTV recently  announced a $70-per-month, sports-only streaming package called MySports and Comcast now has a sports and news bundle for the same price (as long as you're an Xfinity customer with auto-pay, otherwise it's more expensive).\nTraditional cable networks\nDozens of linear programming networks were once only available with cable TV, like Bravo, BET, Food Network, HGTV, CNN, Lifetime, SYFY and MTV. If you only subscribe to, say, Netflix or Apple TV+, you won’t have access to those. But as with sports, standard streamers are starting to incorporate this content into their offerings. After the Warner Bros. merger, Max incorporated some content from HGTV, Discovery and TLC. Peacock has Bravo and Hallmark shows, and Paramount+ has material from Nickelodeon, MTV and Comedy Central.\nOther channels like AMC+ have stand-alone apps. The Discovery+ app gives you 15 channels ad-free for $9 per month (or with ads for $5 monthly). And a service called Frndly TV starts at a mere $7 per month and streams A&E, Lifetime, Game Show Network, Outdoor Channel and about 35 others. Of course, most live TV streaming options will deliver more sizable lists of cable networks, but just note that you may already be paying for some of them — and if all you need is a certain channel, you could get it cheaper by subscribing directly.\nOn-demand streaming\nMost live TV subscriptions include access to a selection of video-on-demand (VOD) content, like you would get with a traditional streaming service. Much of this content is made up of the movies and TV series that have recently aired on your subscribed networks. This typically doesn’t cover live events and news programming, but I was able to watch specific episodes of ongoing shows like Top Chef or BET’s Diarra from Detroit. Just search the on-demand library for the program, pick an episode and hit play.\nPartnerships, like Hulu’s relationship with Disney, and add-ons, such as bundling Max with your YouTube TV subscription or Starz with your Sling plan, will let you watch even larger libraries of on-demand content. But again, if VOD is all you’re after, paying for those networks directly instead of through a live TV plan will be far cheaper.\nDigital video recordings (DVR) limits\nEvery option I tried offers some cloud DVR storage without needing a separate physical device. You’ll either get unlimited storage for recordings that expires after nine months or a year, or you’ll get a set number of hours (between 50 and 1,000) that you can keep indefinitely. Typically, all you need to do is designate what ongoing TV series you want to record and the DVR component will do all the hard work of saving subsequent episodes for you to watch later. You can do the same thing with sports events.\nAside from being able to watch whenever it’s most convenient, you can also fast-forward through commercials in recorded content. In contrast, you can’t skip them on live TV or VOD.\nSimultaneous streams and profiles per account\nEach plan gives you a certain number of simultaneous streams, aka how many screens can play content at the same time. And while most providers will let you travel with your subscription, there are usually location restrictions that require you to sign in from your home IP address periodically. Stream allowances range from one at a time to unlimited screens (or as many as your ISP’s bandwidth can handle). Some plans require add-ons to get more screens.\nMost services also let you set up a few profiles so I was able to give different people in my family the ability to build their own watch histories and libraries, set their favorite channels and get individual recommendations.\nPicture-in-picture mode and multiview\nPicture-in-picture (PiP) usually refers to shrinking a video window on a mobile device or computer browser so you can watch it while using other apps. Sling, YouTube TV, FuboTV, Philo, DirecTV Stream and Hulu + Live TV all have PiP modes on computers and mobile devices. Another feature, multiview, lets you view multiple live sports games at once on your TV screen. YouTube TV and FuboTV are the only live TV streamers that let you do this. With YouTube TV, you can select up to four views from a few preset selection of streams. FuboTV offers the same feature, but only if you're using an Apple TV or Roku streaming device.\n4K live streams\nRight now, just FuboTV, YouTube TV and DirecTV Stream offer 4K live streams — but with caveats. YouTube TV requires a $20-per-month add-on, after which you’ll only be able to watch certain live content in 4K. DirecTV Stream has three channels that show live 4K content — one with shows and original series, and two with occasional sporting events. You don’t have to pay extra for these but you do need to have either DirecTV’s Gemini receiver, or a device from Fire TV, Apple TV or Roku. You’ll need those same streaming devices to watch the select 4K programming on Sling as well. FuboTV shows certain live events in 4K but access is limited to the Elite and Premier packages, not the base-level Pro plan.\nOf course, watching any 4K content also requires equipment that can handle it: a 4K smart TV or 4K streaming device paired with a cord and screen that can handle 4K resolution.\nTiers, packages and add-ons\nComparing price-to-offering ratios is a task for a spreadsheet. I… made three. The base plans range from $28 to $85 per month. From there, you can add packages, which are usually groups of live TV channels bundled by themes like news, sports, entertainment or international content. Premium VOD extras like Max, AMC+ and Starz are also available. Add-ons cost an extra $5 to $20 each per month and simply show up in the guide where you find the rest of your live TV. This is where streaming can quickly get expensive, pushing an $80 subscription to $200 monthly, depending on what you choose.\nHow to stream live TV for free\nI also downloaded and tried out a few apps that offer free ad-supported TV (FAST) including Freevee, Tubi, PlutoTV and Sling Freestream. These let you drop in and watch a more limited selection of live networks at zero cost. Most don’t even require an email address, let alone a credit card. And if you have a Roku device, an Amazon Fire TV or Stick, a Samsung TV, a Chromecast device or a Google TV, you already have access to hundreds of live channels via the Roku Channel, the live tab in Fire TV, through the Samsung TV Plus app or through Google TV.\nBack to top\nHow we tested\nWhen I begin testing for a guide, I research the most popular and well-reviewed players in the category and narrow down which are worth trying. For the paid plans, just six services dominate so I tried them all. There are considerably more free live TV contenders so I tested the four most popular. After getting accounts set up using my laptop, I downloaded the apps on a Samsung smart TV running the latest version of Tizen OS. I counted the local stations and regional sports coverage, and noted how many of the top cable networks were available. I then weighed the prices, base packages and available add-ons.\nI then looked at how the programming was organized in each app’s UI and judged how easy everything was to navigate, from the top navigation to the settings. To test the search function, I searched for the same few TV shows on BET, Food Network, HGTV and Comedy Central, since all six providers carry those channels. I noted how helpful the searches were and how quickly they got me to season 6, episode 13 of Home Town.\nI used DVR to record entire series and single movies and watched VOD shows, making sure to test the pause and scan functions. On each service with sports, I searched for the same four upcoming NHL, NBA, MLS and NCAA basketball matches and used the record option to save the games and play them back a day or two later. Finally, I noted any extra perks or irritating quirks.\nAll live TV streaming services we’ve tested:\n\nPhilo\nSling\nYouTube TV\nHulu + Live TV\nDirecTV Stream\nFuboTV\nFreevee\nTubi\nPlutoTV\nSling Freestream\nPlex\n\nBack to top\nLive TV Streaming FAQs\nWhat is live streaming?\nStreaming simply refers to video content that is delivered to your screen over the internet. Live streaming can be split into two categories: linear programming and simultaneous transmission. That first one is similar to what you get with cable or broadcast TV, with channels that play a constant flow of movies and shows (sort of what TV looked like before Netflix). Simultaneous streaming lets you watch live events (like a basketball game) or a program (like the evening news) as they happen.\nWhat is the difference between streaming and live streaming?\nStandard streaming, the most popular example being Netflix, lets you pick what you want to watch from a menu of choices. It’s also referred to as “video on demand.” Live streaming refers to sports and news events that you can stream as they happen in real time. It also refers to channels that show a continuous, linear flow of programming.\nWhat streaming service is best for live TV?\nFuboTV does the best job of letting you organize live channels to help you find just what you want to watch. The interface is uncluttered and when you search for something, the UI clearly tells you whether something is live now or on-demand. YouTube TV also does a good job making that info clear. Both have just over 100 live channels on offer.\nWhat is the most cost effective TV streaming service?\nFree TV streaming services like PlutoTV, Plex, Tubi and FreeVee show plenty of ad-supported TV shows and movies without charging you anything. Of course, they won’t have the same channels or content that more premium subscriptions have. Ultimately it depends on what you want to watch and finding the service that can supply that to you in the most streamlined form so you’re not paying for stuff you don’t need.\nIs it cheaper to have cable or streaming?\nA basic cable package used to be more expensive than the base-level live TV streaming service. But now that nearly all major providers have raised their prices to over $75 per month, that’s no longer the case. And with add-ons and other premiums, you can easily pay over $200 a month for either cable or a live TV streaming service.\nWhat streaming service has all the TV channels?\nNo service that we tested had every available channel. Hulu + Live TV and DirecTV Stream carry the the highest number of the top rated channels, according to Neilsen. Hulu’s service also gets you Disney+ fare, which you can’t get elsewhere. FuboTV has the most sports channels and YouTube TV gives you the widest selection of add-ons.\nWhat is the most popular live TV streaming platform?\nYouTube TV has the most paying customers. According to 2024's letter from the CEO, the service has over eight million subscribers. Disney’s 2024 third quarter earnings put the Hulu + Live TV viewer count at 4.6 million. Sling’s customer count dipped from two million to about 1.9 million in 2024 and FuboTV grew its subscriber list to 1.6 million.\nHow safe are free streaming services and websites?\nYou may have heard certain sites that provide free content can be dangerous, leading to stolen info and/or exposing you to malware. That’s likely in reference to certain peer-to-peer (P2P) networks and file-sharing sites that let people download free movies and series — which can come bundled with malicious code.\nBut if you’re talking about the free ad-supported streaming television (FAST) services listed here, from providers like PlutoTV, Tubi and Freevee, they are just as safe as any other streaming service. Since you sometimes don’t even have to provide your email address or credit card info, they can even be more anonymous than apps that require login credentials.\nBack to top\nRecent updates\nJanuary 31, 2025: Added information about which streaming service would live-stream the Super Bowl, including Tubi’s free option. Updated Fubo’s pricing. Added details about DirectTV Stream’s sports-only package and Comcast’s sports and news bundle.\nJanuary 16, 2025: Included higher prices for Sling’s Orange and Blue plans. Noted the demise of the never-launched Venu sports streaming service and mentioned the inclusion of DirecTV’s new sports package.\nDecember 31, 2024: Noted increased pricing for YouTube TV, Hulu+ Live TV and DirecTV. Updated information for 4K streaming capabilities and requirements for multiple services. Reported on the upcoming shut down of Amazon’s Freevee service and the addition of DirecTV’s free service.\nAugust 6, 2024: Updated with the addition of Plex as a free live TV streaming recommendation and mentioned the additional free channels Philo is now including with the free version of its service. Added pricing information for ESPN's new sports-only streaming service, Venu. \nJune 12, 2024: Updated with more information about 4K live streaming, picture-in-picture and multiview modes, as well as video on-demand options. We expanded our recommendations around free live TV streaming services and added a FAQ query about the safety of free streaming services and clarified the difference between standard and live streaming. More traditional streaming services have added live and sports components, so we revised that section accordingly.\nBack to topThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/best-live-tv-streaming-service-133000410.html?src=rss",

The same goes for Samsung TV Plus, which added a trove of K-dramas to its free live and on-demand lineup in 2024. The FAST service has around 800 live TV channels that are organized fairly granularly and you can have up to 15 profiles. There was once a nifty integration with notable music streaming service Tidal, but that collaboration sadly came to an end late in 2024. People who don’t pay for Prime will still be able to access some of the free content through that app. Aside from being able to watch whenever it’s most convenient, you can also fast-forward through commercials in recorded content.
