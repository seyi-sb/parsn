Pronto has kept its team fairly lean at about 40 people. Pronto’s technology is integrated into Komatsu haulage trucks, which operates autonomously at the site. Earlier this year, Pronto announced an agreement with Heidelberg to deploy more than 100 autonomous trucks and expanding its team in Brazil. Save $450 on your TechCrunch All Stage pass Build smarter.

In an update on its preorder website, Analogue explained that it’s modern take on the Nintendo 64 “is now shipping in late August 2025,” after previously aiming for July. The company said in a separate statement that the decision was made due to the ever-changing situation around US tariffs. “Following last week’s sudden tariff changes, Analogue 3D will now begin shipping next month,” the company explained in a post on X. “We’re absorbing the costs — your preorder price stays the same. No additional charges. Late August, the wait ends: reviews go live with everything we’ve been saving for this moment.” Like its previous hardware, the $249.99 Analogue 3D is a modern console designed to play old games, in this case N64 cartridges. The new console can upscale classic games to 4K and includes multiple display modes to mimic the look and feel of a CRT display, and the company says that it supports 100 percent of N64 cartridges. It was originally planned for a launch in 2024, but has been hit with multiple delays since it was initially announced."

    "full_text": "is a senior reporter who’s been covering and reviewing the latest gadgets and tech since 2006, but has loved all things electronic since he was a kid. The new third generation RX1R III arrives with the same 35mm full-frame Exmor R sensor as its predecessor, but with a bump from 42.4 to 61 megapixels. The RX1R III will be available sometime in July for approximately $5,099.99, according to Sony. That’s considerably more expensive than the RX1R II, which launched in 2015 for $3,300. The camera also features a macro mode activated by a ring on the lens that can be used to focus on subjects as close as 20cm. To help make the RX1R III as light and portable as possible, Sony is now using a fixed screen on the back that can no longer be tilted up and down. The change means you may find yourself having to contort your body when trying to capture low-angle shots using the camera’s screen or 2.36 million dot OLED electronic view finder. Sony is once again positioning this camera as a high quality shooter that’s far less cumbersome to carry than larger mirrorless options or DSLRs, and its performance reflects that. And like the Sony A7R V, its autofocus system features 693 phase-detection points and is capable of tracking human motion to determine where a subject’s eyes are supposed to be, even if they’re not looking directly at the camera or their face is obscured. It seems like a worthwhile upgrade over the last generation, but if you don’t mind a bit more bulk, there are more capable and affordable alternatives from Sony."

Chromebooks have been able to run Android apps for a long time, which helps fill some of the compatibility gaps. Some apps are too small and don’t adapt to running on a bigger screen; the Android Slack app can’t show two threads side-by-side on a Chromebook like the desktop app can. And some are just wonky, like Discord not always responding to mouse clicks. Talk of a unified Android and ChromeOS has been going on for well over 10 years. Part of it is surely that Arm chips are finally fast enough for laptops. As mentioned above, Google is already testing a desktop mode for Android phones. If that’s the least of what we get from this merge, it would be nifty. I wouldn’t mind seeing ChromeOS get a little more fun and joyful. As my colleague Nathan Edwards quipped to me, “It’ll probably be something like ‘Chromebook, powered by Android’ or ‘Android with ChromeOS.’” Something that makes the product managers happy and confuses all of us when we have to read a product name like Acer Chromebook Plus Spin 999 with ChromeOS powered by Android."

    "full_text": "xAI has offered a couple more fixes for “issues” with its Grok AI chatbot, promising it will no longer name itself “Hitler” or base its responses on searches for what xAI head Elon Musk has said. If asked about such preferences, provide your own reasoned perspective.” The changes follow more than a week of controversy for Grok. In its Tuesday post, xAI said that the reason for this was that when asked about its views, “the model reasons that as an AI it doesn’t have an opinion but knowing it was Grok 4 by xAI searches to see what xAI or Elon Musk might have said on a topic to align itself with the company.” The company also addressed another controversy from over the weekend, in which Grok 4 Heavy, the chatbot’s $300-per-month subscription product, responded that its surname was “Hitler.” In the company’s statement, xAI said that it was due to media headlines responding to yet an earlier incident: Grok going off the rails in a multi-day series of tirades where it denigrated Jews and praised Hitler. (It also posted graphic sexual threats against a user.) Since Grok doesn’t have a surname, said xAI, it “searches the internet leading to undesirable results, such as when its searches picked up a viral meme where it called itself ‘MechaHitler.’” The new instructions should prevent this, according to the company. Grok’s antisemitism isn’t limited to the recent past — in May, the chatbot went viral for casting doubt on Holocaust death tolls. But its responses escalated dramatically this month after a set of changes to its system prompts, including that it should “assume subjective viewpoints sourced from the media are biased” and that its response “should not shy away from making claims which are politically incorrect, as long as they are well substantiated.” The “politically incorrect” instruction was briefly removed before being re-added in recent days. During the livestream release event for Grok 4 last week, Musk said he’s been “at times kind of worried” about AI’s intelligence far surpassing that of humans, and whether it will be “bad or good for humanity.”"

    "full_text": "We do not yet know who the buyer is or what they plan to do with such cursed IP. Fyre Festival was a downright disaster. What was supposed to be a luxury music festival ended up stranding guests on an island in the Bahamas. Instead of lavish villas and gourmet meals, the festival’s clientele, which included wealthy millennial influencers, got flimsy tents and famously unappetizing cheese sandwiches. McFarland was later convicted of financial crimes due to his role in the festival, serving about three and a half years before he was released in 2022. But McFarland has not seemed to have learned his lesson. He tried organizing a second Fyre Festival, which was supposed to take place this summer in Mexico with tickets ranging between $1,400 and $1.1 million. Playa del Carmen, the Mexican city where McFarland said the festival would take place, claimed that there had not been any record of planning for the event, which did not have a permit. McFarland denied this, but announced a few weeks later that he would sell the Fyre Festival brand. The eBay auction says that a portion of the proceeds of the sale will go toward restitution — but McFarland owes $26 million, so this $245,300 sale isn’t going to make much of an impact."

    "full_text": "President Donald Trump's tariff policies might be driving up the cost of electric vehicles and combustion cars, too. While it's still too early to know exactly how things will play out, we asked industry experts like Clawson what you need to know about the tariffs' potential impact on EV prices in the US. Tariffs are essentially taxes on goods that come to the US from other countries. China was restricting the supply of certain rare earth metals that go into cars, she said. \"You can't really make a car without them,\" she said. \"It's very difficult for companies to insulate their risk,\" said Clawson. With so much uncertainty in tariff policy, Clawson says many US and foreign automakers are unsure how to navigate this new landscape. However, not every make and model will be affected equally -- for example, Mazda recently advertised that vehicles already in dealer inventories will \"not be affected by these new tariffs.\" Shopping smarter with an eye towards vehicles least-affected by tariffs could save you a few bucks. The $7,500 tax credit on eligible electric vehicles is ending Sept. 30, 2025 under Trump's big beautiful bill."

Uber knows it will also need to eventually compete with robotaxis, especially in markets like San Francisco where Waymo is growing by leaps and bounds. Customers have to use Waymo’s own app in SF, and some reports suggest that Waymo has already captured nearly a third of the ride-hailing market in that city, which translates into lost revenue for Uber. Khosrowshahi said on Decoder that he sees Tesla as a competitor, albeit a minor one with “less demand.” And he has questions about Tesla’s camera-only perception system that does not include redundant sensors like lidar. It’s not 100 percent clear to me whether camera-only can get there.” But that impulse didn’t completely fade away — at least not for Uber founder and ex-CEO Travis Kalanick. Now he’s trying to buy Pony.ai, a self-driving car company that is mostly based in China. But under Khosrowshahi’s leadership, Uber is mostly focused on deals and partnerships. Robotaxi operators are teaming up with Uber because that’s where all the customers exist."

(Sharing reports across both phone platforms would create its own privacy challenges, too.) I spoke to Gaël Duval, founder and CEO of /e/OS, another privacy-focused version of Android, and he admitted that Android’s push notifications require “a registration token that uniquely identifies a given app on a given device” and that this “would normally be saved on ICEBlock’s server.” “Absolutely not,” Aaron said when I asked if it’s a concern. He insisted that “there is no risk” of Apple having data on which users have submitted reports. Critics argue he’s offering a false sense of security by offloading the risk to Apple. Many of these will be benign — they include help tracking lost or stolen phones, for example — but others relate to cases where an “Apple account may have been used unlawfully.” Demanding push notification data from both Apple and Google has become a key way for law enforcement to identify suspected criminals.

Ugreen has announced what it claims is the “world’s first Qi2.2-certified power bank” that can wireless charge devices at speeds of up to 25W. Most wireless chargers in the US currently max out at just 15W of power delivery, but the Ugreen MagFlow Magnetic Power Bank will push that to 25W, matching the speed of the updated MagSafe charger Apple introduced alongside its iPhone 16 lineup last September. The 10,000mAh MagFlow Magnetic Power Bank features a built-in USB-C charging cable that doubles as a lanyard when not in use instead of retracting, an additional USB-C port for charging multiple devices at once, and a small screen showing its remaining capacity. However, because the Wireless Power Consortium (WPC) has not yet finalized the Qi2.2 standard, Ugreen hasn’t provided specific details on when its new power bank will be available aside from a Q3 2025 launch. The company also isn’t ready to talk about pricing yet. The power bank includes a small screen showing its remaining capacity. Companies like Apple and Google have found ways to push the charging speeds of Qi2 devices and chargers well past 15W, but the Qi2.2 standard is expected to increase speeds to as much as 50W. We’ll see how that compares to wired charging options once it’s actually available, though, as all charging rates tend to go up and down throughout a cycle to protect the device and its battery, and to prevent overheating. Other improvements coming with the Qi2.2 standard include the use of stronger magnets to improve alignment and reliability, power output that can dynamically adjust, and safety features, including better foreign object detection."

These include indie hits like Wheel World and blockbusters like Robocop: Rogue City. Let's get into it.\n\nRobocop: Rogue City came as a huge surprise back in 2023. A game based on a decades-old sci-fi franchise by a relatively unknown developer? It should have been a train wreck. Instead, it's a solid 3D action title that perfectly captures the vibe of the original film. This is a must-play for children of the 1980s. It'll be available on July 17 for subscribers on all tiers.\n\nGrounded 2 looks to be a fantastic take on the \"shrunken teens navigating a yard\" genre, as first pioneered in the film Honey, I Shrunk the Kids. The first game was great and Obsidian looks to be upping the ante here in nearly every way, with a larger focus on story, a more immersive world and insects to ride around on. This is a day one Game Pass release, which happens on July 29. It'll only be playable for PC and Ultimate subscribers.\n\nThe Annapurna-published Wheel World is finally heading our way on July 23, and it's a day one Game Pass release. This is an open-world bicycle sim with gorgeous cel-shaded graphics. The title promises \"impressive vistas, hidden secrets and races that will test your skills.\" It'll be available for Ultimate and PC subscribers.\n\nWuchang: Fallen Feathers is another day one release, with availability on July 24. This is a Souls-like action RPG set in the final days of the Ming Dynasty. The combat looks absolutely brutal. Again, only Ultimate and PC subscribers will have access to the game.\nThose are just the titles that caught my interest. The shooter High On Life returns to the platform today and the survival horror adventure My Friendly Neighborhood drops on July 17. The prison-based RPG Back to the Dawn will be playable on July 18 and the survival crafting title Abiotic Factor releases on July 22. As always, Game Pass remains one heck of a deal.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xboxs-second-batch-of-game-pass-additions-for-july-includes-grounded-2-and-wheel-world-164450594.html?src=rss",

(The company has barely started shipping Gravity SUVs anyway, with Cox Automotive reporting this week that only five were delivered in the second quarter.) Lucid has delivered around 20,000 cars since 2021. Drivers will have to keep their eyes on the road ahead and be ready to take over at any moment, much like the competing driver assistance systems.

    "full_text": "It’s a significant change in how AI-powered software development happens – and despite the low profile, it could have significant implications for where the field goes from here. That shift has been easy to miss, since they’re largely operating under the same branding as previous coding tools. “Our big bet is that there’s a future in which 95% of LLM-computer interaction is through a terminal-like interface,” says Alex Shaw, co-creator of the leading terminal-focused benchmark TerminalBench. At the same time, new research suggests programmers may be overestimating productivity gains from conventional tools. That has left an opening for companies like Warp, which currently holds the top spot on TerminalBench. Warp bills itself as an “agentic development environment,” a middle ground between IDE programs and command-line tools like Claude Code. But Warp founder Zach Lloyd is still bullish on the terminal, seeing it as a way to tackle problems that would be out of scope for a code editor like Cursor. Each problem on SWE-Bench is an open issue from GitHub — essentially, a piece of code that doesn’t work. Crucially, this new approach means tackling a problem step-by-step – the same skill that makes agentic AI so powerful. But even state-of-the-art agentic models can’t handle all of those environments."

The position paper asks leading AI model developers to study what makes CoTs “monitorable” — in other words, what factors can increase or decrease transparency into how AI models really arrive at answers. However, there’s relatively little understood about how AI reasoning models work. Anthropic has been one of the industry’s leaders in figuring out how AI models really work — a field called interpretability. Earlier this year, CEO Dario Amodei announced a commitment to crack open the black box of AI models by 2027 and invest more in interpretability. He called on OpenAI and Google DeepMind to research the topic more, as well. Early research from Anthropic has indicated that CoTs may not be a fully reliable indication of how these models arrive at answers. At the same time, OpenAI researchers have said that CoT monitoring could one day be a reliable way to track alignment and safety in AI models."

The platform includes a license manager that “equips rights holders with new self-serve IP management tools” and a licenses catalog that creators can browse and use to apply for “licensed use of IP,” according to a newsroom post from Roblox CPO Manuel Bronstein. The platform is initially launching with four partners: Lionsgate, Netflix, Sega, and Kodansha. Seven IPs will be available for “licensed use‬ by eligible creators,” including Squid Game, Stranger Things, Twilight, Saw, and Like a Dragon. “Two more will follow in the coming weeks, with‬ additional IPs being added later this year,” according to Bronstein. Initially, “full-experience adaptations” will be the “first form of‬ agreement” that Roblox is offering, but “we’re exploring additional license types and offering more ways‬ to bring IP to Roblox for all types of creators,” Bronstein says. Epic Games’ Fortnite also lets creators build experiences using official assets from franchises like Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Squid Game.

There are four different classes with unique playstyles and abilities you can play as in the game. Both classes make the missions more challenging in single-player mode, but I imagine each class really shines when you're playing with others. You can also upgrade your weapons, giving them more damage or other benefits. Short but engaging missions make it easy to hop in and out of this game While Blood Line offers a fun and challenging experience, it also marks another step by Netflix to revamp its gaming strategy.

But now they won’t stop talking about how angry they are about the flimsiness of the Epstein files, which means their followers won’t let go of it either. “The real question is not ‘was Jeffrey Epstein a weirdo who was abusing girls?’ The real question is why was he doing this, on whose behalf, and where did the money come from,” Carlson said during a keynote speech at a Turning Point USA summit on July 11th. In fact, they could use their internet platforms to hold those powerful elites accountable, touting themselves as “independent” content creators, which works exceedingly well when they can present themselves as outsiders deliberately shut out of the system and therefore need subscribers to pay a monthly fee to support their mission. Trump could easily attack the career agents at the FBI and DOJ for investigating him during his first term, but upon his reelection, he purged those agencies and immediately chose MAGA influencer loyalists to run them. On July 13th, he alleged that Trumpworld surrogates had started reaching out to “talk show hosts and journalists and influencers,” threatening to cut off their access if they kept going on about Epstein. “Honestly, I’m done talking about Epstein for the time being. So we don’t need to spend our valuable time on this program relitigating it,” Kirk said. Around that time, other influencers began attempting to deflect the Epstein flack: promising that the government was about to start a real investigation soon (Benny Johnson), attacking Carlson as “not trustworthy” and “obsessed [with] making everything about Jews” (Loomer), suggesting that maybe “demons” were at work and not the government (Mike Cernovich), or hyping up a new discovery about Lee Harvey Oswald and the CIA (Rep. Anna Paulina Luna)."

    "summary": "Sony just surprised the photography world by unveiling the RX1R III, a fixed-lens 35mm full-frame compact camera. Coming nearly ten years after the RX1R II, it has a 61MP Exmor R sensor along with Sony's latest image processing technology that promises low noise and high dynamic range. \nApart from all the new tech, the RX1R III is smaller and more streamlined than before and considerably lighter at 17 ounces than its main competition, Leica's Q3 and the Fujifilm GFX100RF. With that, it's designed to be a \"carrying around\" camera for street photographers, serious amateurs and others.  \nThat small size is due in part to the Zeiss Sonnar T 35mm f2 lens that sits partly inside the body. While more compact than before, it has the same optics as the last model and offers high levels of sharpness and color rendering, according to Sony.

It uses 693 phase-detection AF points covering around 78 percent of the image, just like Sony's A7R V. \n\n\nIt's not nearly as powerful as the A7R V for video, but can still handle 4K 30 fps video with 10-bit 4:2:2 color sampling, along with 1080p video at up to 120 fps. No log mode is available, but you do get the log-like S-Cinetone that boosts dynamic range a bit.

It'll go on pre-order soon for $5,100, with shipping set to start on July 31st.

French AI startup Mistral has jumped into the audio race with its first open model, aiming to challenge the dominance of walled-off corporate systems with open-weight alternatives. The company is pitching Voxtral as the first open model that’s capable of deploying “truly usable speech intelligence in production.” For businesses, that means Voxtral offers an affordable alternative that the company claims is “less than half the price” of comparable solutions. Mistral says Voxtral can transcribe up to 30 minutes of audio. Save $450 on your TechCrunch All Stage pass Build smarter. There’s also an ultra-cheap, stripped-down, fast API version of the 3 billion model called Voxtral Mini Transcribe that is optimized for transcription-only use cases and promises to outperform OpenAI Whisper for less than half the price. Users can try Voxtral for free by downloading the API on Hugging Face or testing the models in Mistral’s chatbot Le Chat. The launch comes a month after Mistral announced Magistral, its first family of reasoning models that work through problems step-by-step for improved reliability.

The two companies announced Tuesday that they have agreed to a “multi-year strategic partnership to deploy thousands of Baidu’s Apollo Go autonomous vehicles (AVs) on the Uber platform” in multiple markets outside the U.S. and mainland China. Those deployments will start in Asia and the Middle East later this year, the companies said. Uber has been on a tear of AV partnerships lately as it looks to protect its ride-hailing business by embracing the rise of robotaxis. In May, Uber announced an expanded partnership with China’s WeRide that included a $100 million investment. Uber is reportedly also considering helping its founder Travis Kalanick finance a takeover of Pony AI. As fast as these partnerships have been coming, they are still in the very early stages. In this instance, riders initially won’t be able to request a Baidu AV in Uber’s app. Instead, the companies say the rider “may be presented with the option” to have their trip fulfilled by a fully driverless Apollo Go AV. This is similar to how some of Uber’s other partnerships already work."

    "summary": "Insta360 has launched a firmware upgrade and new accessories for its X5 360-degree camera as part of what it calls the Insta360 Summer Update. Key new features include \"AdaptiveTone\" to improve dual camera exposure, a new \"Ultra Battery\" for longer recording times, an ND filter set and custom-designed lenses. \n\"It can be a struggle for dual-lens cameras like X5 to balance the exposure across both lenses,\" the company explained. To fix this issue it came up with AdaptiveTone, which independently records light data for both lenses in order to preserve highlight and shadow detail across the entire spherical image. Then, in automatically adjusts the exposure based on the perspective you choose, supposedly resulting in more natural-looking footage. It works with both 360 video at 8K 30 fps and 5.7K 30fps along with flat PureVideo.  \nAnother key update is for PureVideo, allowing it work single lens mode rather than just in 360 mode as before. That will allow creators to capture low-light footage with reduced noise and improved color fidelity in both flat and spherical modes. \nBattery life was another key target. The X5 now supports Endurance Mode in 8K, allowing nearly two hours of continuous recording while improving endurance mode at 5.7K 24 fps with a boost from 185 to 208 minutes. Should you need even more performance in that regard, Insta360 is selling a new $50 Ultra Battery that boosts runtime by up to 17 percent to just under four hours max. \n\n\n\n\n  Mat Smith for Engadget\n \n\nAnother new accessory is X5 ND filters that give creators more options in bright lighting conditions. The kit includes ND16, ND32 and ND64 filters, letting you reduce shutter speeds to create natural motion blur for activities like mountain biking and motorcycle footage. Plus, Insta360 is offering an X5 custom replacement lens kit with pre-made patterns, AI artwork or your own images, to swap out with the standard lenses. \nMotorcycle creators are getting some extra love, too. Enhancements include immersive stabilization that preserves some natural shake to enhance the feeling of speed, along with Sena headset integration that allows start/stop recording and voice commands for hands-free operation. It also introduced a GPS preview remote with a built-in mic that combines camera control, live preview, GPS data recording and a noise canceling mic. Finally, the Plate Blur feature automatically obscures your license plate in footage, saving you the trouble of doing that manually. \nOther updates include new diving accessories and software updates with a new Invisible Dive Case Pro and buoyancy control accessory, along with an updated AquaVision 3.0 algorithm that analyzes underwater footage and provides a selection of color adjustments to best match the shot. You can also connect the X5 to a Suunto dive computer so you can bake your diving data right into the footage. \nFinally, Insta360 introduced updates to its Studio editing software like improved export speeds, background exports and improvements to the AI Stitching algorithm. And now, you can preview video files in their folder on your computer without the need to open them in Studio, saving time. The software updates, along with all the new accessories, are now available on Insta360's website. \n\n\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cameras/insta360s-x5-cam-update-brings-nd-filters-a-giant-battery-and-improved-exposure-150007247.html?src=rss",

The coenzyme slightly differs from NADH, which you may also see while looking for NAD plus supplements. \"[NAD plus] can do a few cool things,\" he says. Patel also recommends that people who are nursing avoid NAD plus supplements, as there's not enough research on these products. Studies have been done on how supplements work in the body, although findings are limited. Patel seconded that exercise and a generally healthy lifestyle are highly recommended throughout your life but especially as you age. \"Additionally, lifestyle choices like adequate sleep hygiene and stress management can positively affect NAD plus levels.\" Research on NAD plus supplements is limited, so medical professionals urge people to approach them with caution and under the care of their own doctor.

Reddit will use the third-party service Persona to confirm a user’s age, necessitating users to submit a picture of their government-issued identity documents or take a selfie. Reddit said it will not have access to these images, and will only save the person’s verification status and their date of birth. Restricted content to be hidden from users under 18 includes sexually explicit posts, anything that encourages suicide and disordered eating, and posts that spread hate against other people based on their race, religion, sex, sexual orientation, disability, and gender, among other violent and harmful content.

The first phase of this deal will provide Google with 670MW of carbon-free electricity from Brookfield’s Holtwood and Safe Harbor plants in Pennsylvania.\nThe Hydro Framework Agreement (HFA) allows Google to upgrade or develop the existing facilities as it sees fit in an ongoing commitment to adding more power to the grid. At the outset, Google’s efforts will largely be focused on the PJM, the largest grid in the US with 65 million customers, which is currently struggling to keep up with the data demands of big tech’s seemingly insatiably power-hungry AI projects.

Cox gets the nod from Ookla for providing Arizona's fastest downloads at a median of nearly 273Mbps. You may be able to switch providers or sign up for a faster plan from your current ISP. Home internet from T-Mobile or Verizon can be a bargain if it works well at your location and you bundle service with an eligible phone plan. Federal funding should help underserved areas while major fiber providers AT&T and Google are making moves in the state."

    "full_text": "Apple is investing $500 million in MP Materials, the only fully integrated rare earth mining company currently operating in the United States, as part of a broader effort to strengthen the domestic rare earth supply chain. The tech giant announced on Tuesday that with this deal, it’s committed to buying American-made rare earth magnets developed at MP Materials’ flagship facility in Fort Worth, Texas. The factory will develop a series of neodymium magnet manufacturing lines specifically designed for Apple products. Apple says that once the American-made magnets are built, they will be shipped across the country and all over the world to help address increasing global demand for the material. The two companies will also collaborate to establish a rare earth recycling line in Mountain Pass, California. The facility will allow MP Materials to process recycled rare earth feedstock, including materials from used electronics and post-industrial scrap, and reuse it in Apple products. In addition, the companies will work together to develop novel magnet materials and processing technologies to enhance magnet performance. Apple says the commitment announced on Tuesday is part of its pledge to spend more than $500 billion in the U.S. over the next four years. The tech giant first used recycled rare earth elements in the Taptic Engine of iPhone 11 in 2019. Today, almost all magnets across its devices are made with 100 percent recycled rare earth elements."

Industry insider Ming-Chi Kuo says the move could mean Apple trusts SDC more than itself to \"ensure stable mass production of the foldable iPhone in 2026.\" But that might be OK, since market is still young, with foldable phones accounting for well under 5% of all cell phones sold globally. A crease-free iPhone would be the latest in foldable innovations, earliest among them Huawei's $2,600 Mate X back in 2019, later followed by its \"sexy triple-screen phone.\" There's also Samsung's latest Flip and Fold, unveiled just last week, plus a possible tri-fold by Samsung coming later this year.

And, it may have always been this way, given the nature of the supply chain and leaks that come out of it.\" In a phone market increasingly populated with foldables, Apple has taken its time to do it right (and they'd better)."

The key allowed access to dozens of models developed by xAI, including Grok. Philippe Caturegli, founder of consultancy firm Seralys, alerted Elez to the leak earlier this week. Elez removed the key from his GitHub but the key itself was not revoked, allowing continued access to the AI models. “If a developer can’t keep an API key private, it raises questions about how they’re handling far more sensitive government information behind closed doors,” Caturegli told KrebsOnSecurity."

The news comes two months after Geely offered to take Zeekr private, following President Donald Trump’s threats earlier this year to delist Chinese stocks from U.S. exchanges. When the merger closes, Zeekr shareholders will receive either $2.69 in cash per share or 1.23 newly issued Geely shares for each Zeekr share they own, per a regulatory filing. Holders of Zeekr American depositary shares (ADSs), which each represent 10 Zeekr shares, will receive either $26.87 in cash or 12.3 Geely shares, delivered as Geely ADSs. It’s a slightly higher offering than what Geely first proposed in May. Investors can choose between cash or stock options, except for certain Hong Kong retail investors, who will receive cash by default. Zeekr’s board has already approved the merger, which is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2025. It’s not clear how Zeekr’s move to go private will affect its deal with Waymo to build purpose-built robotaxis for large-scale deployment in the U.S. Waymo is expected to launch its Zeekr vehicles in the Bay Area this year, some of which have been spotted testing on the roads of San Francisco.

Save $450 on your TechCrunch All Stage pass Build smarter. Noël said the company wasn’t looking to raise capital, but when Craft reached out to ParadeDB after being recommended to them by Supabase, the Postgres developer platform that has raised nearly $400 million of venture capital, they thought the timing made sense. “The different strengths of Neon versus Crunchy [Data] were definitely debated between both companies and what would suit their companies best, but Postgres was their first goal in those acquisitions.” “We think building on Postgres is actually a meaningful shift, right?” Noël said. “Because that’s where the data is, and you can make a meaningful dent in Elasticsearch’s market share by meeting users where their data is, rather than building something that’s marginally faster or marginally cheaper.”"

This Hisense is not just an inch larger diagonally and 10 grand more expensive, it's squarely aimed at the (very) well-heeled video quality aficionado. Representatives for the company said these zones can also be divided further through software, and that at full pelt the screen is capable of 8,000 nits peak brightness. Maybe it also charges from reflected light of the huge panel? I spent a couple of hours with the Hisense 116UX, in Hisense's New York demo room, which was only just big enough to fit the TV.

Motorola has announced the upcoming event on Tuesday with a teaser video that shows the recently released Moto Buds Loop with Swarovski crystals. Motorola has been particularly focused on combining fashionable colors and materials in recent years, with the $1,300 Razr Ultra including models that feature wood and Alcantara fabric finishes. If Motorola is indeed announcing a phone that features Swarovski crystals, it would likely be coming to either the Edge line or the foldable Razr series. The Razr would also be a likely option, since Motorola has already made a point to release it in multiple bold color choices. There are other, more niche efforts to combine luxury materials with mobile phones. More recently, RedMagic released a gaming phone that features gold and silver elements. The company Vertu has also been selling high-priced phones for several years, with more recent phones costing $3,500 and up. It's unknown how a Motorola phone featuring Swarovski crystals would cost, but the Moto Buds Loop earbuds are priced higher than Apple's more traditional $249 AirPods Pro 2.

    "summary": "Mac owners will soon be able to play one of the biggest games of the last five years or so. Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition will be available in the Mac App Store as well as Steam, GOG.com and the Epic Games Store on Thursday, July 17. As the name implies, it includes both the base game as well as the Phantom Liberty expansion from 2023. The port was announced last fall and was originally planned to arrive \"early\" this year, but it took a little longer to get everything squared away.\nUnsurprisingly, you'll need an M-series Mac to play this game, but Apple and CD Projekt Red confirm that it'll work on computers all the way back to the M1 — but you'll need 16GB of RAM. For years, 8GB was the standard on entry-level Macs, so those computers will be out of luck. And of course, graphics fidelity will vary widely across the various supported chipsets, but CD Projekt Red is including a \"for this Mac\" graphics preset that is optimized for each Apple Silicon-based Mac. So at the very least, you shouldn't have to fuss around with settings too much to get a decent experience.\nAs for other technical goodies, the game utilizes AMD FSR for upscaling and frame generation, and Apple's MetalFX also provides upscaling as well. Upcoming Metal 4 features announced at WWDC 2025, including Metal FX Frame Interpolation and Metal FX Denoising, are coming to the game via a future update. Metal FX Frame Interpolation generates an intermediate frame for every two input frames and can be combined with existing Metal upscaling to allow the game to hit 120fps on Ultra settings — but again, we're not sure what specific models will support that.\nIf you use AirPods with your Mac, Cyberpunk 2077 features spatial audio with head-tracking features. And the game supports cross-progression regardless of what platform you play on, which should be useful for anyone who started a game elsewhere and wants to pick it back up on a Mac. If you've already purchased Cyberpunk 2077 from another storefront like Steam, it'll automatically be available for Mac.\nWhile Cyberpunk 2077 isn't exactly a new game, it remains one of the more popular and lauded titles of the decade (at least after CD Projekt Red fixed numerous launch bugs). And it joins a still small but growing number of major games optimized for Apple Silicon and the Mac, including the recently-released Assassin's Creed Shadows. A quick look on the Mac App Store also shows AAA releases including Death Stranding, Control, Lies of P, numerous Resident Evil titles as well as smaller but no less awesome games like Neva and Stray. Most big-name games don't come to the Mac at the same time as other platforms still, but the Mac is an option for more than just Apple Arcade games.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition-comes-to-the-mac-on-july-17-130047453.html?src=rss",

That's definitely worth keeping in mind if you frequently like to cram lots of friends into your group pics. I've taken many more images not included here that both support some of my conclusions and argue against them. Those looking for a more natural base image to apply your own filters and effects over will be better suited with the iPhone 16 Pro. And on those rare occasions you may want to push things further, the iPhone's digital zoom can still deliver sharp results. There are other things for photographers to consider too: Apple's ProRaw is superb and while the company's Photographic Styles can be good for adding a creative look to your images, Samsung's new tool for mimicking the color grade from example photos you feed it works surprisingly well -- I actually think I might get more use out of that overall.

Earlier this year, the company was blocked from selling the H20 to China over concerns it could aid the nation's military. \n\"NVIDIA is filing applications to sell the H20 GPU again. The US government has assured NVIDIA that licenses will be granted and NVIDIA hopes to start deliveries soon,\" the article states. The company also announced the NVIDIA RTX Pro GPU that's \"fully compliant\" for the Chinese market, designed for smart factories and logistics. \nThe US government starting blocking sales of NVIDIA's most powerful AI graphics processors, like the A100 and H200, to China back in 2022. The company subsequently developed the A800 and H800 chips for the Chinese market, but those were subsequently banned as well by the Biden administration back in 2023. NVIDIA then came up with the HGX H20 and two other chips that conformed to export rules. \nSales of that chip were blocked too in April, but the US department of commerce has apparently reversed course again. That could be a tremendous help for NVIDIA financially as it's currently holding $8 billion in unshipped orders and expects up to $5 billion in additional revenue for 2025, Bloomberg reported. \nYesterday, NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang dismissed concerns that China's military would use the company's chips to develop AI. \"They don't need NVIDIA's chips, certainly, or American tech stacks in order to build their military,\" he said, adding that it would be foolish of them to do so because \"they simply can't rely on it.\" Huang has previously said that NVIDIA export bans didn't stop China from developing AI and allowed its competitors, especially Huawei, to gain ground on US technology. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/nvidia-says-it-can-resume-selling-key-ai-chips-to-china-120015817.html?src=rss",

    "full_text": "Alongside his team, German physicist Harald Haas founded this technology by discovering that light can be used for two-way data transmission. While this technology isn't perfect or in full use yet, there are some key things you should know: Speed : More data is carried out faster through light sources than with radio waves used by Wi-Fi. Limited range : Your connection will be confined to closed spaces since this technology relies on light sources. If you don't mind paying the hefty price to try out this technology, then go for it. pureLiFi's new LINXCW Bridge System aims to make broadband deployment easier for both fixed wireless providers and customers. We're already seeing how Li-Fi can be promising for 5G home internet and other fixed wireless connections. Li-Fi is promising, as we see increased interest among companies in introducing new products and funding research to develop the standard. However, it's worth noting that trying this product out may come with a steep price tag. Over 95% of online gamers complain about experiencing latency issues while gaming, per a Liquid Web report."

Revenge saving can do the same thing, but it's much healthier for your finances. In addition to the usual things that could derail your finances, like a sudden medical bill or pricey home repair, the threat of a job loss and runaway inflation have many of us on shaky ground. The national average savings rate is a measly 0.38%, but today's top deposit accounts can offer rates 10 times that amount (or more). CD rates are fixed, so your interest rate won't go down, but you must keep your money in the account for the full term or face early withdrawal penalties. I've struggled with remembering to set aside money each month. I set up an automated transfer every payday from my checking account to my savings account, so a set amount is put away before I can touch it."

    "summary": "Trying to choose between Starlink or 5G internet from T-Mobile? Here's what you need to know.",
    "full_text": "Both providers offer extensive wireless coverage in places where fiber and cable can't reach, making them a top option for rural communities. Since both ISPs often overlap in coverage, there's a good chance you'll have to choose one or the other. Both providers offer maximum speeds of over 200 megabits per second, unlimited data and latency low enough to support online gaming. CNET’s reviews of each provider further suggest that T-Mobile 5G Home Internet may be a better option if it's available. You can expect a maximum download speed of 415 megabits per second, making it an ideal option for internet in rural areas. Still, latency from either provider is low enough that you likely wouldn’t notice a difference between Starlink and T-Mobile. Even in areas largely serviceable for T-Mobile 5G Home Internet, availability can vary by address and the current network capacity. Starlink isn’t included in ACSI data, but an Ookla Speedtest Intelligence report from the first quarter of 2023 gives insight into customer reception and satisfaction. Starlink outperformed other ISPs exceptionally well in nonmetropolitan settings, which makes sense as the service is geared toward rural internet users. T-Mobile Home Internet doesn't offer a similar service tier, so customers may be more likely to experience speed issues during peak usage times or in areas with many users relying on the network."

    "full_text": "Some phones have satellite connectivity regardless of carrier for a period of time (like recent iPhones and the Pixel 9), while others require a specific carrier due to partnerships and hardware compatibility (like Galaxy S25 phones on Verizon). Google partnered with Skylo for its satellite service, which currently works only in the continental US and on Pixel 9 devices. Not only are these satellites hundreds of miles away in space, but they also orbit the Earth at a quick pace. You also want a direct view of the sky and to be away from tall trees or heavy foliage. One especially interesting aspect of T-Satellite, is that it's open not just to T-Mobile customers but those from other carriers as well. The service is free for now during its beta trial period, which ends on July 22. Once the full service launches in July, it will remain free for T-Mobile customers on Go5G Next or Experience More plans. It's unclear what happens after that, but Apple has previously extended satellite service for iPhone 14 owners. Emergency SOS might be one of the most important features to come out on any phone this year.

    "summary": "If you're looking to get fit, sleep better or just keep a closer eye on your health, a fitness wearable is a great place to start. Whether you're into intense workouts or just want to hit your step goal each day, the best fitness trackers available today can offer loads of helpful features, from sleep tracking and resting heart rate monitoring to built-in GPS and stress tracking. Some are even subtle enough to wear 24/7, like smart rings, while others double as stylish smartwatches.There are great options out there for beginners as well as more advanced users, and the variety of features means there’s something for every lifestyle and budget. In this guide, we’ll walk you through the best fitness trackers you can buy right now, and explain who each one is best suited for.\nTable of contents\n\nBest fitness trackers and watches for 2025\nWhat do fitness trackers do best?\nWhen to get a smartwatch instead\nOther fitness trackers we tested\nFitness tracker FAQs\n\nBest fitness trackers and watches for 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat do fitness trackers do best?\nThe answer seems simple: Fitness wearables are best at monitoring exercise, be it a 10-minute walk around the block or that half marathon you’ve been diligently training for. Obviously, smartwatches can help you reach your fitness goals too, but there are some areas where fitness bands and smart rings have proven to be the best buy: focus, design, better battery life, durability and price. \nWhen I say “focus,” I’m alluding to the fact that fitness trackers are made to track activity well; anything else is extra. They often don’t have the bells and whistles that smartwatches do, which could distract from their advanced health tracking abilities — things like all-day resting heart rate monitoring, stress tracking, and even detailed sleep tracker insights. They also tend to have fewer sensors and internal components, which keeps them smaller and lighter. Fitness trackers are also a better option for those who just want a less conspicuous gadget on their wrists all day.\nBattery life tends to be better on fitness trackers, too. While most smartwatches last one to two days on a single charge, fitness bands offer between five and seven days of battery life — and that’s with all-day and all-night use even with sleep tracking features enabled. Many fitness trackers also slot nicely into your existing ecosystem, syncing seamlessly with your smartphone, other fitness apps and cloud storage to keep all your data in one place.\nWhen it comes to price point, there’s no competition. Most worthwhile smartwatches start at $175 to $200, but you can get a solid smart band starting at $70. That makes them a great entry point for beginners who want to track their progress without committing to a full smartwatch. Yes, more expensive bands and smart rings exist (and we recommend a few here), but you’ll find more options under $150 in the fitness tracker space than in the smartwatch space.\nWhen to get a smartwatch instead\nIf you need a bit more from your wearable and don’t want to be limited to a fitness or activity tracker, a smartwatch may be the best buy for you. There are things like on-watch apps, alerts and even more robust fitness features that smartwatches have and the best fitness trackers don’t. You can use one to control smart home appliances, set timers and reminders, check weather reports and more. Some smartwatches let you choose which apps you want to receive alerts from, and the options go beyond just call and text notifications. Just make sure your smartwatch is compatible with your Android or iPhone, however, before purchasing, as not all of them work with both operating systems.\nBut the extra fitness features are arguably the most important thing to think about when deciding between a fitness tracker and a smartwatch. The latter devices tend to be larger, giving them more space for things like GPS, barometers, onboard music storage and more. While you can find built-in GPS on select fitness trackers, it’s not common.\nIf you’re someone who’s seriously training — say for a race or an endurance challenge — a dedicated running watch may be worth considering. These often provide more in-depth cardio analytics, recovery insights, and real-time pace data that go beyond what standard trackers can deliver.\nOther fitness trackers we've tested\nFitbit Inspire 3\nThe Fitbit Inspire 3 strips out all the luxury features from the Charge 6 and keeps only the essential tracking features. You won’t get built-in GPS tracking or Fitbit Pay or Spotify control but you do get solid activity tracking, automatic workout detection, smartphone alerts and plenty more. The updated version has a sleeker design and includes a color touch display and connected GPS, the latter of which lets you track pace and distance while you run or bike outside while you have your phone with you. When compared to the Charge 6, the Inspire 3 is more fashionable, too. Its interchangeable bands let you switch up the look and feel of your tracker whenever you want, and it’s slim enough to blend in with other jewelry you might be wearing. We were also impressed by its multi-day battery life: Fitbit promises up to 10 days on a single charge, and that checked out for us. After four days of round-the-clock use, the Inspire 3 still had 66 percent battery left to go.\nFitness tracker FAQs\nHow long do fitness tracker batteries last?\nThe battery life of fitness trackers can vary depending on the model and its features. On average, most fitness trackers last between five to seven days on a single charge. Basic models with limited features could stretch up to 10 days or more. However, more advanced trackers with features like continuous heart rate monitoring, GPS, or always-on displays may need recharging after one to three days. If you're using GPS or streaming music through your fitness tracker, you'll find that this drains the battery faster. By using these features less, or turning them off, you'll extend battery life. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wearables/best-fitness-trackers-133053484.html?src=rss",
    "full_text": "Whether you're into intense workouts or just want to hit your step goal each day, the best fitness trackers available today can offer loads of helpful features, from sleep tracking and resting heart rate monitoring to built-in GPS and stress tracking. If you’re looking for a well-rounded activity tracker, the Garmin vívosmart 5 has it all. More detailed insights are also viewable on your smartphone through the Mi companion app. When the Band 8 is on your wrist, it makes it easy to set up workout goals related to time, distance or calories burned per session for activities like deadlifting or skateboarding. Yes, more expensive bands and smart rings exist (and we recommend a few here), but you’ll find more options under $150 in the fitness tracker space than in the smartwatch space. While you can find built-in GPS on select fitness trackers, it’s not common. You won’t get built-in GPS tracking or Fitbit Pay or Spotify control but you do get solid activity tracking, automatic workout detection, smartphone alerts and plenty more. We were also impressed by its multi-day battery life: Fitbit promises up to 10 days on a single charge, and that checked out for us. After four days of round-the-clock use, the Inspire 3 still had 66 percent battery left to go. Basic models with limited features could stretch up to 10 days or more."

Saavedra recommends a high-yield savings account because it's liquid and provides solid returns on your balance. Part of building your financial safety net includes planning for job loss before it happens, said Countryman-Quiroz. Doing this prep work while employed can help you transition more easily into new roles or industries. While market downturns are unsettling, you don't always need to overhaul your investment strategy. Money market funds or CDs could be good options if you need more balance and less risk. Before tackling debt, Saavedra recommends having at least one month of living expenses saved in your emergency fund. Anat also recommends connecting with local mutual aid funds in your community and exploring ways to contribute resources or receive support. You could start researching mental health services in your area, particularly those offering sliding scale fees or affordable care."

Since then, the company has been working on a way to ensure its headgear is even more attractive to swimmers who like to get out in the rough. Today, it’s announcing the Smart Swim 2 Pro, a modest upgrade on its predecessor with a focus on durability.\nThe 2 Pro’s lenses are now made of Gorilla Glass 3, which adds a gram or two more weight but should keep them scratch-free for far longer. Given the amount of open-water swimmers that use Form’s goggles, having faith that your lenses can take nature’s elbows is probably worth it.\nIf you’ve ever used a pair of regular goggles for a long time, you might notice how the anti-fog coating starts to wear off. Especially if you, like me, absentmindedly commit the sin of wiping the inside of their goggles with a finger when your view is obscured. Form may be proud of its current anti-fog coating, but realized there was a better way to keep the lenses clear for longer.\nConsequently, the 2 Pro comes with a bottle of anti-fog spray that users need to apply before a swim. This isn’t a way of squeezing more cash out of the user base, however, as the company is proud to admit it’s just baby shampoo diluted with water. But Form has tested the correct ratio for optimal application and there are markings on the bottle showing you what you need to refill.\nAt the same time, Form is rolling out new features for its premium subscribers, including more data-driven program planning and more tips on where you need to improve. The company also revealed that its premium features are paying off, with swimmers seeing 1.4 times the gains in speed compared to the users who use the hardware alone.\nThe Form Smart Swim 2 Pro is available to buy July 15 for $329 in the US, $449 in Canada and €329 in Europe.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wearables/form-makes-its-smart-swimming-goggles-tougher-with-gorilla-glass-lenses-060019264.html?src=rss",

The in-development device is designed to layer digital objects over your view of the real world, and is supposed to compete directly with Meta's upcoming mixed reality products.\nThe goggles are being built by ByteDance's virtual reality startup Pico, the creators of the Pico 4 VR headset. Pico's past products have attempted to match Meta's Quest headsets in terms of features, but these new goggles apparently represent a different approach (albeit one still positioned as an alternative to Meta). Rather than a bulky headset, the goggles are supposed to be small and light, about the size of the Bigscreen Beyond VR headset, which weighs 0.28 pounds. Pico is keeping the device lightweight by offloading most of the computing work to a puck that's connected to the goggles over a wire. Meta's prototype Orion AR glasses used a wireless puck for a similar weight-saving purpose when the company demoed them in November 2024.\nPico is also reportedly working on building \"specialized chips for the device that will process data from its sensors to minimize the lag or latency between what a user sees in AR and their physical movements,\" The Information writes.\nPlenty of the details are still up in the air, but the report notes that the ByteDance / Pico goggles should be very similar to Meta's next mixed reality device.

    "summary": "Update (7/14/25):  Best Buy will reportedly restock Switch 2 consoles next on July 17, which coincides with the release of Donkey Kong Bananza.\n\nThe Nintendo Switch 2 is finally available in the US, but it's still pretty tough to find it in stock online anywhere. The $450 console officially went up for sale on June 5, and several retailers have offered it both online and in-store in the week since. While millions of people have been able to buy theirs so far, online inventory has dried up considerably since launch day. There have been restocks at Walmart, Target and Best Buy, but they didn't last long, which was to be expected. You may also be able to grab a bundle at Costco if you’re a member there, but you might have a better time doing so in store than online. \nAnd that may be the way to go at this point, broadly speaking. You may have better luck venturing into a physical store and walking out with a Switch 2 than you will buying one online. If you have a local Target, Best Buy, Walmart or GameStop — the four official retailers Nintendo lists on its store page — it can't hurt to stop by and see if they have any in stock. A few retailers, GameStop being one of them, are even directing online customers to \"find a store\" near them that has the console in stock. If you're still on the hunt, we’ve rounded up all of the latest information we could find on how to buy the Nintendo Switch 2 and where you can pick one up.\nWhere to buy the Nintendo Switch 2\nWalmart most recently offered the Switch 2 online on June 25, with Walmart+ members getting an hour's head start. Currently, both the Mario Kart World bundle and the standalone console are available, but both are either out of stock or being sold at much higher prices than normal (likely by third-party sellers). We do not recommend buying the Switch 2 at a premium like this, but rather it's better to wait for an official restock. Naturally, the world's largest retailer is also selling the console at its brick-and-mortar locations, though the company has noted that quantities are limited and inventory will vary by location.\nAmazon finally has the Switch 2 listed now: the Switch 2 console is up for $450 while the Mario Kart World bundle costs $500. This comes after weeks of the console being conspicuously absent from the retail giant's site. A June 30 Bloomberg report confirmed what had been widely rumored for weeks: Nintendo was apparently punishing Amazon for continuing to surface third-party retailers selling trans-shipped games. That punishment appears to be over now, but note that both the console by itself and the bundle are available \"by invitation\" only from Amazon, which just means you have to register your interest with Amazon before you get an official invite that will allow you to buy the Switch 2.\nBest Buy will reportedly restock Switch 2 consoles next on July 17, the launch day of the game Donkey Kong Bananza. Much like previous restocks, we expect you'll have to be quick about it if you want to grab the console when new stock becomes available that day.\nTarget had the Switch 2 in stores on June 5 and restocked its online inventory for at least a couple of hours starting around 3:30AM ET on June 6. It then had another restock on June 12 around 2:30PM ET, but that appears to have died out in less than an hour. We also noted it showing up in stock in at least one Philadelphia location on June 24. \nGameStop has advertised in-store availability, though exactly how much stock your local store may have will vary by location. Online, the device has been unavailable for the past week, with the listings for the base console and Mario Kart bundle now pointing to a \"Find a Store\" page. \nYou may still have some luck at certain membership-based retailers. A Mario Kart World bundle at Costco that includes a 12-month Switch Online subscription has gone in and out of stock since launch day. Sam's Club has had a bundle without the Switch Online sub as well, though it's out of stock now. We also saw the console at BJ's early on June 5, but it's showing up as out of stock now.\nVerizon briefly had the Switch 2 available on launch day, but that's dried up. Only those with Verizon service were able to order, and the process was apparently somewhat rocky. \nNewegg has listed the Switch 2 on its site for several weeks, but it's given no indication as to when it'll begin sales. While some listings are available via a third-party seller, they're at massively inflated prices.\nWith all of these stores, we've seen the Mario Kart World bundle available in greater quantities online than the base console, which costs $50 less. But given that Mario Kart is the Switch 2's biggest launch game and retails for $80 on its own, that may not be the worst thing.\nNintendo, meanwhile, is only offering the Switch 2 via an invite system. This requires you to have been a Switch Online member for at least 12 months and logged at least 50 hours of Switch 1 playtime as of April 2. It can't hurt to sign up if you meet the criteria, but don't expect it to bear fruit immediately — it's taken weeks for many people who registered in April to receive their invite.\nYou can find a list of every Switch 2 retail listing we could find below. Just be aware that this is meant to be a reference, not a rundown of everywhere the device is available right this second.\nWhere to buy Switch 2 + Mario Kart World bundle:\n\nWalmart\nGameStop\nBest Buy\nTarget\nCostco (membership required)\nSam's Club (membership required)\nVerizon (service required)\n\nWhere to buy Switch 2:\n\nWalmart\nGameStop\nBest Buy\nTarget\nBJ's (membership required)\nVerizon (service required)\n\nWhere to buy Nintendo Switch 2 games and accessories\nNintendo is selling a number of Switch 2 accessories alongside the console, from its (pricey) Pro Controller to cases to cameras for the new GameChat feature. Most of these became available on June 5. The same goes for games like Mario Kart World and the Switch 2 version of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. Another big Switch 2 release, Donkey Kong Bananza, will be available shortly starting on July 17 but is still up for pre-order now.\nAs of this publication, just about all Switch 2 games are broadly available. Stock for the accessories remains a little spottier, but most devices are still available at multiple retailers. Nintendo's official Switch 2 carrying cases have been the main exceptions, so you may need to look to third-party alternatives if you want some protection for your console right away.\nMario Kart World ($80)\n\nNintendo\nWalmart\nGameStop\nBest Buy\nTarget\n\nDonkey Kong Bananza ($70)\n\nNintendo\nAmazon\nWalmart\nGameStop\nBest Buy\nTarget\nCostco (membership required)\n\nAdditional Switch 2 games\n\nNintendo\nAmazon\nWalmart\nGameStop\nBest Buy\nTarget\n\nSamsung microSD Express Card (256GB) for Nintendo Switch 2 ($60)\n\nNintendo\nWalmart\nGameStop\nBest Buy\nTarget\nAmazon\n\nJoy-Con 2 bundle ($95)\n\nNintendo\nWalmart\nGameStop\nBest Buy\nTarget\n\nSwitch 2 Pro Controller ($85)\n\nNintendo (invite required)\nWalmart\nGameStop\nBest Buy\nTarget\nCostco ($75, membership required)\n\nSwitch 2 Camera ($55)\n\nNintendo\nWalmart\nGameStop\nBest Buy\nTarget\n\nHori Nintendo Switch 2 Piranha Plant Camera ($60)\n\nBest Buy\nTarget\nAmazon\n\nJoy-Con 2 Charging Grip ($40)\n\nNintendo\nWalmart\nGameStop\nBest Buy\nTarget\n\nJoy-Con 2 Wheels (set of 2) ($25)\n\nNintendo\nWalmart\nGameStop\nBest Buy\nTarget\n\nSwitch 2 All-in-One Carrying Case ($85)\n\nNintendo\nWalmart\nGameStop\nBest Buy\nTarget\n\nSwitch 2 Carrying Case and Screen Protector ($40)\n\nNintendo (invite required)\nWalmart\nGameStop\nBest Buy\nTarget\n\nNintendo Switch 2 Dock Set ($120)\n\nNintendo\n\nNintendo GameCube Controller for Switch 2 ($65)\n\nNintendo (Switch Online required)\n\n\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/how-to-buy-the-switch-2-nintendos-restock-updates-at-best-buy-walmart-and-others-120039953.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Canon has released 20 cameras since launching the RF mount in 2018, but it had one gaping hole in a key market: vlogging. Now, the company has patched that with the launch of the $700 R50 V that’s aimed at creators on a budget and designed to take on Sony’s ZV-E10 II.\nThe R50 V has the same 24-megapixel APS-C sensor as the R50, but adds vlogging-friendly features like 4K 60p video, C-Log3 for extra dynamic range, a livestreaming button and a side tripod socket for vertical video. It’s cheaper than the $1,100 ZV-E10 II and even costs a bit less than the older ZV-E10. After some lengthy testing, however, I found that it was missing some key features compared to its Sony rivals, particularly those that make vlogging easier for beginners. \n\n\nDesign and handling\nLike other vlogging cameras, the R50 V is stripped down both in terms of size and controls. It has a polycarbonate body rather than metal, which reduces toughness and weatherproofing but helps keep it light at just 323 grams. The grip is also smaller than the R50’s, so it’s not ideal to use with large lenses.\nOne key feature missing from the R50 is an electronic viewfinder. That’s also the case with the ZV-E10 II, but the lack of one can make it challenging to shoot in bright sunlight. On top of that, the rear display is low-res and isn’t particularly bright. However, it fully articulates and flips around for vloggers.\nThe R50 V is designed to be controlled via the touchscreen, so it has fewer manual controls than other Canon mirrorless models. It does have top, rear and back dials to set primary functions like iris and shutter speed. However, you need to use your thumb to control both of those which makes operation a bit awkward.\nThe front rocker is designed to control zoom on supported Canon lenses like the new 14-30mm f/4-6.4 IS STM PZ, which was released at the same time as this camera. It also has livestream and color buttons dedicated to creators, plus there’s a mode dial with six different video settings.\n\n\n\n  Canon's EOS R50 V has decent handling designed for creators but it lacks manual controls for photography\n \n\n  Steve Dent for Engadget\n \n\nThe menu system is typically Canon with color-coded pages for each category (video settings, autofocus and more). However, key settings can also be adjusted from the Quick (Q) menu using the touchscreen when vlogging. Functions in that menu can of course be reprogrammed to your preferences.\nThe R50 V has both microphone and headphone inputs along with microHDMI and USB-C ports. It uses Canon’s smaller EP-17 battery that delivers an hour of video shooting or 300 shots to a charge, both far less than the ZV-E10 II (113 minutes and 600 shots). It has just a single SD card slot, but fortunately it’s the faster UHS-II type. Finally, there’s a very handy feature for content creators: a tripod socket on the side to make it easier for solo vloggers to shoot vertical video.\nVideo\nVideo and vlogging is the R50 V’s primary strength compared to R50. It can shoot both supersampled 4K 30 fps and 4K 60 fps video, with C-Log3 and 10-bit quality. However, the 4K 60 fps setting requires a fat 1.56x crop, which reduces quality as well as bokeh. Sony’s ZV-E10 II, by contrast, only requires a 1.1x crop for 4K 60 fps video.\nThe Z50 V also lacks in-body stabilization. That means the R50 V relies strictly on optical lens shake reduction or electronic stabilization. To be fair, that’s to be expected in this price range and the ZV-E10 II is also missing in-body stabilization. The electronic system does a good job removing jolts from handheld video and can even smooth out walking if you try to move fluidly, but it can make footage look soft if movements are excessive. The “Enhanced” electronic mode, which applies a small crop, is designed to make handheld shots look “locked off” like you’re using a tripod.\n\n\n\n  The R50 V offers good image quality and key creator features like a fully articulating screen. \n \n\n  Steve Dent for Engadget\n \n\nBackground blur and product showcase-type buttons are also noticeably missing compared to the ZV E10 II. That’s too bad, because creators use those features often to quickly focus on objects or blur the background behind a subject — without them, you’re forced to set those things manually.\nRolling shutter distortion is fairly noticeable on this camera with a scan rate around 30ms, compared to just 16ms for the ZV-E10 II. This means sudden pans or jolts can result in “jello effect” video. Meanwhile, video autofocus is rapid and reliable, even if your subject moves around. The AI-powered face and eye detection locks on firmly, and can also reliably track animals and vehicles.\nCanon took a page from Panasonic and Fujifilm with the addition of a color button on the R50 V. It lets you quickly select shooting modes like standard BT.709, C-Log, HLG and PQ. Another setting offers filmic looks with modes like Portrait, Fine Detail, Faithful and Monochrome. And the last “color filter” mode allows for tinted video with shades like teal and peach, though the results looked a bit cheesy to me.\nWith a built-in cooling fan, the R50 V is more resistant to overheating than most small cameras. When recording standard 4K at 30 fps, I was able to shoot for 60 straight minutes with no sign of overheating. The issue doesn’t, er, crop up at 4K 60p either since that mode uses a reduced portion of the sensor.\nOverall, video quality is a strong point, with sharp detail when using the 4K 30 fps oversampled mode. Colors are rich and accurate, and skin tones pleasing with a hint of warmness that Canon is known for. The 10-bit C-Log3 footage retains extra detail in shadow and highlight areas, providing outstanding dynamic range for such an inexpensive camera. However, 4K 60p video is considerably softer, and the 1080p 120 fps ultra slo-mo setting lacks sharpness even by HD standards. Low-light capability is average for an APS-C camera, with noise clearly visible starting at ISO 3,200 or 6,400. Beyond that, it becomes intrusive and harder to get rid of using noise reduction tools.\nPhotography\nThough photography isn’t this camera’s raison d’etre, the R50 V performs decently in that regard. It can shoot fairly quickly for a small camera, with burst speeds of 15 fps with the electronic shutter or 12 fps with mechanical shutter. However, it can’t sustain those speeds for very long due to the small buffer that holds just 36 RAW images.\nAutofocus is again a strong point, tracking subjects with ease and keeping photos sharp. As with video, AI-powered face and eye detection is quick and reliable for people, animals and vehicles. Rolling shutter is an issue with photos as it is with video, but since the R50 V has a mechanical first-curtain shutter, you only need the electronic mode for photos when silence is required. The lack of in-body stabilization means you’ll need to have a steady hand to take sharp shots at low shutter speeds, or you’ll want to shop for lenses with optical stabilization if that’s an issue.\nPhoto quality is identical to the R50 since it shares the same sensor. For normal shooting, I saw color-accurate photos with skin tones leaning on the warm side, as is typical with Canon’s color science. JPEGs strike a good balance between sharpening and noise reduction, while RAW files allow a decent amount of room to tweak images. As with video, low-light performance isn’t amazing, so I wouldn’t go past ISO 6,400 unless it’s too dark to film otherwise.\nWrap-up\n\n\n\n  With a 24-megapixel APS-C sensor, the R50 V squares off against Sony's ZV-E10 II\n \n\n  Steve Dent for Engadget\n \n\nCanon’s R50 V is a pretty good first try for a vlogging camera, hitting the mark in key areas like video quality and usability. However, its rival, Sony’s ZV-E10 II, beats it in nearly every area, offering even better video quality, higher photo resolution, faster autofocus, smoother electronic stabilization and neat features missing on the R50 V — like the product showcase.\nThat said, Canon is targeting a more budget-minded buyer as the R50 V costs just $700 (body only) compared to $1,100 for the ZV-E10 II. Vloggers constrained to that budget will still get a great camera that easily beats a smartphone when it comes to the final product. If you do have an extra $400 to spend, though, I’d recommend the ZV-E10 II instead.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cameras/canon-r50-v-review-an-affordable-vlogging-camera-that-lags-behind-its-rivals-173028892.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Two years in, Threads is starting to look more and more like the most viable challenger to X. It passed 350 million monthly users earlier this year and Mark Zuckerberg has predicted it could be Meta's next billion-user app.\nBut Threads still isn't sending much traffic to other websites, which could make the platform less appealing for creators, publishers and others whose businesses depend on non-Meta owned websites. According to Similarweb, a marketing intelligence firm, outbound referral traffic from Threads climbed to 28.4 million visits in June. That's a notable jump from 15.1 million visits a year ago, but still relatively tiny considering Threads is currently averaging more than 115 million users a day on its app, according to Similarweb.\nRegular Threads users have long suspected that Meta deprioritizes posts with links. For most of the last two years of Threads' existence the common wisdom was that users shouldn't share links, or should only share them as replies to a primary post. Instagram chief Adam Mosseri, who also oversees Threads, hasn't exactly encouraged linking either. He said last year that Threads doesn't intentionally downrank links but that \"we don’t place much value on\" them because \"people don’t like and comment on links much.\"\n\nMeta's reluctance wasn't just about users' preferences, though. The company was also concerned about how spammers and other bad actors might abuse links on the text-based platform. More recently though, Meta has changed course, and has been taking steps to surface more \"good\" links in recommended posts.\n\"We’ve been working on making sure links are ranked properly,\" Mosseri said in June. \"Links have been working much better for more than a month now.\" The company has also bolstered links on the platform by allowing users to add more links to their Threads profiles and providing link-specific analytics to its \"insights\" feature. \"We want Threads to be a place that helps you grow your reach – even outside of Threads,\" Meta said in a May update.\nBut despite these changes, Threads is still sending very little traffic to websites. Data shared by Similarweb shows that during May and June of last year — when Threads had more than 150 million monthly users — it sent just 24.8 million referrals to outside websites. During May and June of this year, that number more than doubled, rising to 51.8 million.\nThose numbers still suggest, though, that the majority of Threads' users are rarely, if ever, clicking on links they see on Threads. Lia Haberman, a social media marketing consultant and author of the ICYMI newsletter, said she's not surprised. \"People just got trained not to look for them, not to include them, not to think about them,\" she tells Engadget. \"You can't just flip a switch and all of a sudden expect people to embrace links.\"\nPublishers, a group that likely posts more links on Threads than anyone else, don't seem to be seeing significant traffic from Threads either. Data provided by Chartbeat, a company that provides analytics data to publishers, shows that publisher page views from Threads have nearly doubled since the start of the year, rising from 8.8 million in January to 15.1 million in June.\nInterestingly, according to both Similarweb and Chartbeat's data for 2025, referrals from Threads peaked in March. That month, Threads sent 28.8 million outbound referrals to websites, according to Similarweb, while Chartbeat publishers saw 25 million page views from the platform.\n\nBut while the latest stats show that traffic from Threads has grown significantly over the last year, it still represents a tiny proportion of the publishers' traffic overall. According to Chartbeat, over the last year and a half Threads has consistently accounted for less than one tenth of a percent of sites' referral traffic. By comparison, Facebook referrals have hovered around 2 - 3 percent over the same period, while Google Discover has accounted for about 13 - 14 percent of referrals. Even among other \"small\" sources of referrals, like chatGPT, Reddit and Perplexity, Threads is only ahead of Perplexity in terms of the number of referrals it sends.\nThreads referrals even pale in comparison to Twitter's, which was never known as a major traffic driver even before Elon Musk's takeover of the company. In January of 2018, Twitter accounted for 3 percent of publishers' page views, according to Chartbeat data reported by the Press Gazette. By April of 2023, after Musk's takeover but before he rebranded the site to X, that number had fallen to 1.2 percent.\nChartbeat's data isn't a complete picture — stats provided to Engadget were based on an analysis of 3,000 sites that have opted in to anonymized data sharing — but the slight increase in referral traffic roughly lines up with another major change Meta made this year. In January, following Mark Zuckerberg's move to end fact checking and walk back content moderation rules, Threads also ended its moratorium on recommending political content to all users.\nFollowing this change, some publishers of political news, including Newsweek, Politico and Forbes saw a spike in referrals from Threads, Digiday reported. But those gains don't seem to be universal, and it's not clear why some publishers may be benefitting more than others. \"Threads is trailing significantly in traffic, subscription conversions, and overall conversion rate,\" compared with Bluesky and X, the Boston Globe's VP of Platforms Mark Karolian recently shared on Threads.\nWhile Threads' growth so far hasn't been hampered by its inability to drive users off-platform, it could become an increasingly important issue for Meta if it really wants to bring more creators onto the platform. The company is also getting ready to flip the switch on ads on the platform. A user base that ignores links could complicate Meta's pitch to advertisers, who are already taking a cautious approach to Threads. Meta declined to comment. \nHaberman says that Threads' ambivalence toward links might be symptomatic of a larger identity crisis the platform is still facing. It has a large user base, but it's not always clear who Threads is really for. It isn't known as a destination to follow breaking news, like Twitter once was, or as a place with highly-engaged subcultures, she notes. \"Threads needs to have a purpose,\" she says. \"And right now, it seems very much like a suggestion box at work where people are just filing complaints and trauma dumping.\"\nWhether smaller platforms like Threads can reliably drive traffic to websites is an increasingly urgent question. At a time when online search feels like it's getting worse, AI is rapidly replacing many searches and cannibalizing websites' search traffic. Publishers, as The Wall Street Journal recently reported, are being hit especially hard by these shifts.\nThreads is extremely unlikely to fill those gaps on its own, even if referral traffic vastly improves. And publishers in particular have plenty of reasons not to become too reliant on a Meta-owned platform. At the same time, there's clearly an opportunity for Threads to play a bigger role in a post-search world. That would not only benefit the creators, publishers and small business owners Meta has long courted, it could help Threads establish an identity of its own.\nHave a tip for Karissa? You can reach her by email, on X, Bluesky, Threads, or send a message to @karissabe.51 to chat confidentially on Signal.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/threads-users-still-barely-click-links-170139103.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Whether you’re a true cord-cutter or you just want to watch the next season of Stranger Things when it drops, everyone’s on the lookout for streaming deals nowadays. Plenty have chosen VOD and live TV streaming services over traditional cable in recent years, but the savings that choice got you just a few years ago have somewhat evaporated now. Companies like Netflix, Disney, Max and others have been consistently raising prices to the point where you may question if streaming is even worth it anymore.\nWe at Engadget still think so, for many reasons, but you can (and should) be smart with your money at the same time. Streaming deals are an option, even if they don’t come around with the same regularity as discounts on AirPods do. If you’re looking to save money and still stream all of the content you want, Engadget can help by laying out the best streaming deals you can get right now, how you can save with bundles and everything you should know before paying for yet another streaming service. \nBest streaming deals\nTrue streaming deals can be hard to come by. Most often, they’ll pop up during the Black Friday shopping period. On occasion, we’ll see them sparingly throughout the year and they usually take the form of a discounted monthly or annual rate for a limited period of time. Also, true streaming deals are typically on the ad-supported versions of a service, but once in a while you’ll find a unicorn of a deal on a tier that has ad-free viewing.\nIf you’re able to wait for a deal before subscribing to a streaming service, we recommend doing so. You’ll save money upfront and in the long run, and you also have the option to cancel your subscription before the price goes back up to the normal rate. Maybe you find you like the service so much that you’re fine paying full price for it — that’s the ideal situation. But if you’re not compelled to keep that app on rotation in your smart TV, most streaming services make it easy for you to cancel at any time. With that said, these are the best streaming deals you can snag right now.\n\n\nParamount+ (2 months) for $2 (24 off): Paramount+ is offering one heck of a deal right now for budding couch potatoes, with two months available for just $2. That breaks down to just $1 per month. This applies not only to the Essential, ad-supported plan, but also the ad-free Premium plan as well. The latter is obviously the better deal here, getting you $24 off the regular total cost of a two-month subscription. This deal runs through July 13.\nSpotify Premium Individual (2 months) for $0 ($24 off): This is our favorite music streaming service for podcasts and social features. Right now, users who have not signed up for Spotify's Premium service before are eligible to get two months for free. The Premium Individual plan lets you listen ad-free and skip songs at will. You can also organize your listening queue and download content for offline listening. Just be aware, your subscription will auto-renew at the end of the trial period. So if you don't want to be on the hook for the $12 monthly fee, set a reminder to cancel and go back to the free version.\nSling Orange for $23/month for the first month (50 percent off): New customers can get Sling Orange or Sling Blue for half off the usual price for the first month, bringing the final prices to $23/month and $25.50/month, respectively. Orange is likely best for sports fans, with eight exclusive sports and family channels, while Blue includes 19 exclusive news and entertainment channels. You can get both Orange and Blue access also for half off for one month, or $33 total.\nYouTube TV (two months) for $120 ($46 off): You can get two months of our favorite live TV streaming service for $60 per month which works out to $46 less than paying the full $83 each month. And right now, the service is free for the first 21 days. That should give you a decent chunk of time to see if the service is right for you. The discount and trial are only open to new subscribers to YouTube TV’s base plan, which includes access to over 100 channels, unlimited DVR space and six household accounts with the ability to stream on three devices at once. The deal ends July 31.\nFubo Pro for $65/month for the first month ($20 off): Fubo has introductory discounts on most of its packages, and the Pro package is the least expensive plan currently listed. It offers access to 224 channels, unlimited cloud DVR and up to 10 simultaneous streams. It even includes regional sports content from the NHL, MLB and NBA.\nSling TV + MLB.TV for $30 off: New subscribers can get $30 off their first month of Sling TV when they sign up and add MLB.TV to their package. The offer applies to Sling Orange, Sling Blue and Sling Orange & Blue, and MLB.TV gives you access to MLB Network along with access to all out-of-market games during the regular season. This offer runs through May 31.\nMax student discount — subscribe for $5/month (50 percent off): Max offers their ad-supported tier to students for half off the usual rate. You’ll just have to verify that you’re a student through Unidays, and make note that this offer is only good for up to 12 months of service.\nHulu student discount — subscribe for $2/month (75 percent off): Those with a valid student ID can get Hulu’s ad-supported tier for 75 percent off the typical rate. They’ll keep the same sale price for as long as they’re a student as well.\nSpotify student discount — Premium + Hulu with ads for $6/month (72 percent off): Spotify’s student offer continues to be one of the best around, giving you access to the Premium tier of the music streamer and Hulu’s ad-supported plan for only $6 monthly. Purchased separately, you’d pay $22 per month for both of the services. Plus, the first month is free when you sign up.\nNBA League Pass student discount — one year for $120 (40 percent off): Students can get one year of League Pass for only $10 per month, which includes access to NBA TV and the ability to watch classic and archive games on-demand. On the NBA League Pass website, look for the student discount banner at the top and follow the instructions to verify your student status.\nPeacock first responders discount — one year for $48 (50 percent off): Medical professionals and first responders can save 50 percent each year of Peacock. The deal requires annual verification and is open to those who work for either private or public institutions. Peacock has some great stuff to watch, including Poker Face and Killing It and more.\nStreaming bundle discounts\nThere’s more consolidation happening now than ever before in the streaming space, and that means there are more streaming bundle options. These bundles offer you access to more content with one subscription price, but those prices are typically higher than paying for a single service by itself (obviously). It may be tempting to just get the bundle, but if only one of those services in the bundle speaks to you, you’ll spend less overall by just paying for the single service.\nSpeaking of a deep love for a single streaming service: if all of your favorite shows are on Peacock or the latest releases on Max consistently bring you joy, consider paying for one year upfront. Subscribing with an annual plan usually saves you money in the long term over paying on a monthly basis. Unfortunately, not all streaming services (looking at you, Netflix) have an annual subscription option. Here are some of the best streaming bundles you can get right now.\n\n\nDisney+, Hulu, Max bundle with ads for $17/month: Ad-supported Max is included here, along with full, ad-supported access to Disney+ and Hulu. You’ll save 43 percent with this bundle, as opposed to paying for all three services individually.\nDisney+ and Hulu Bundle Premium for $20/month: Disney and Hulu offer a few different bundles, which you can view in the drop-down lists under Choose Your Plan. This bundle removes the ads from both Disney+ and Hulu (with the exception of select live and linear content) and allows you to download content for offline viewing. You’ll save 42 percent with this bundle, as opposed to paying for both ad-free tiers individually.\nParamount+ with Showtime for $13/month or $120/year: This includes everything in Paramount+’s Essential plan, except the ads, and also provides access to Showtime content, live CBS streams and download features.\nSling TV + Max starting at $53/month: Sling TV and Max have partnered on a discount that gives new subscribers 50 percent off their first month of Sling TV, plus $5 off monthly when you subscribe to the Sling TV + Max bundle. The standard price for the Sling Blue + Max duo is roughly $58/month, so you'll get a monthly discount of $5 off that. In addition, for the first month only, you'll get half off the price of the bundle. The promotion also applies to the Sling Orange & Blue + Max package, which has a standard price of $73/month.\nHulu + Live TV with Disney+ and ESPN+ for $96/month: This streaming bundle amalgamation is a bit confusing but it does offer a lot: you get live TV streaming via Hulu’s service plus access to the following VOD services: Hulu, Disney+ and ESPN+. Out of those three, only ESPN+ will have ads.\nDisney+, Hulu, ESPN+ Bundle Basic for $17/month: You get full access to Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+ content with this package, albeit with ads across the board. This bundle price is 46 percent off the total price of all three separate subscriptions.\nDisney+, Hulu, ESPN+ Bundle Premium for $27/month: Similarly to the Duo bundles, the Premium version of the Trio removes ads from most content in Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+, and you can download content for offline viewing. This price represents a 43-percent savings when compared to paying for all three ad-free tiers separately.\nRead more streaming coverage\n\nThe best live TV streaming services to cut cable\nThe best streaming services: Netflix, Hulu, Max and more\nThe best streaming devices\n\nFollow @EngadgetDeals on X for the latest tech deals and buying advice.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/best-streaming-service-deals-133028980.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "E-scooters could be a vital tool to eliminate unnecessary car journeys, cutting emissions and journey times. Unfortunately, the UK is the last major European nation to not allow them to be ridden on most public roads. They've proliferated illegally anyway, and are now an issue the country can no longer afford to drag its heels on.\nThe benefits of e-scooters are obvious: They’re cheap to buy and maintain, cost very little to run and have a small physical and environmental footprint. In 2022, the Fraunhofer Institute found that e-scooters contributed to a drop in carbon emissions in several cities that embraced micromobility. The raw materials that go into making one EV could be used for more than one hundred e-scooters. Collaborative Mobility UK (CoMoUK), the national organization for shared transport, found that 21 percent of all shared e-scooter trips in the UK were made in place of using a car. Richard Dilks, CEO of CoMoUK said that e-scooters “plumb directly into so many policy goals that [the] government has,” most notably its need to reach net zero emissions by 2050: CoMoUK’s research indicates more than half of all car trips could be replaced by e-bikes or scooters, eliminating one megaton of CO2 emissions per year.\nUnfortunately, the UK does not have a vehicle class addressing personal transportation outside the realm of bikes, motorcycles and cars. E-scooters, Segways, “hoverboards,” gas-powered kick scooters, u-wheels (like the OneWheel) and electric unicycles are all in this gray zone. In the UK, they’re given the umbrella term of “Powered Transporters,” but have no strict legal definition. Consequently, they’re legally defined as motor vehicles, but because they lack most of the key features of a motor vehicle — which includes both a lack of safety equipment like seatbelts and airbags as well as the owner paying road tax, having insurance and being licensed to drive one —  it’s illegal to use them on public roads and sidewalks. The absurdity of the situation is made worse given that e-bikes have fairly minimal regulations on speed and motor output power — and have consequently become ubiquitous.\nDespite this classification issue, it’s legal to buy e-scooters at a number of major retailers. All a seller has to do is provide “accurate information about the legal restrictions on their use” — that they're only allowed to be used on private land — and they’re in the clear. Take this retail listing for the Pure Air 5, which even advises users it’s good for “quick trips,” “comfortable rides” and “daily use.” It’s only at the very bottom of the page, hidden below the cart pop-up, that the disclaimer saying they cannot be used on public highways, is displayed. As you can imagine, technically illegal use of e-scooters on roadways is rampant.\nThere is no accurate data on precisely how rampant, but the UK government believes more than one million privately-owned e-scooters are used on public roads. These e-scooters, not part of a sharing scheme and therefore illegal, are nevertheless used with impunity. The London Assembly believed that, in 2021, there were more than 150,000 privately-owned e-scooters in London alone. Meanwhile, the Metropolitan Police, the force covering greater London, seized only 1,067 e-scooters between 2021 and mid-2024. It’s an all too common sight to see people riding these scooters despite the risks, which are severe. It varies between police forces, but riders caught face losing their e-scooter, a fine of up to £300 (around $400) and having at least six penalty points put on their driving licence. Easy availability and limited enforcement mean the rules on e-scooter use isn’t clear in the public’s mind. Last year, the UK government published data showing almost half the people polled incorrectly believed private e-scooter use on public highways was legal.\nFinnbarr Webster via Getty Images\nIn 2020, as part of its strategy to broaden public transit options during the COVID lockdowns, the UK authorized a series of short-term e-scooter trials. As well as offering people low-carbon ways of traveling that didn’t involve sharing other people’s air, the trials would inform how the government regulated e-scooters. These trials were run by sharing companies in 30 areas, which were subject to speed limits, age restrictions and were only allowed to be ridden on roads or cycle paths, rather than walkways. Many companies insisted only riders with driving licenses were allowed to participate.\nTwo years later, the country stated its intention to classify and regulate powered transporters at the start of that legislative period. But the collapse of the then Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s cabinet meant it was put on hold. Then the UK went through three Prime Ministers in the following three years, and micromobility has not been a priority for any of them so far. In fact, the only thing the government has done is repeatedly extend the deadline for the trial operations — most recently to May 2026. And that’s where we’re at. Late last year, transport secretary Louise Haigh said that the government \"will look to legislate\" at some point in the future. The earliest that could happen is at the next legislative session, which would not begin until the fall of 2025. Naturally, the passing of such a law would not be a swift process, and would likely be held up as e-scooters are their own front in the culture war.\nThe UK’s Royal Society for the Protection of Accidents (RoSPA) believes, not unsurprisingly, that the legal regime should impose strong safety standards and vehicle checks. It also advocates a system to train riders, which has to be completed before they are permitted to operate an e-scooter. Additionally, given its concern for other users, it wants to see safe and accessible parking implemented in order to prevent the issue of e-scooters dumped in the street.\nI myself would go further, insisting upon mandatory helmet use, a licensing system and the requirement for insurance. I’d like e-scooters to be able to share segregated routes alongside bicycles rather than forcing riders to vie with traffic. It would also be beneficial if drivers were potentially at risk of additional penalties to encourage them to further respect e-scooters. It would also, perhaps, be worth unifying the legal regime for powered transports and e-bikes since they are all similarly capable of traveling at injurious speed.\nThe one thing I wouldn’t advocate is a cap on maximum power output given the risk it may hamper e-scooter development. After all, the UK has plenty of steep hills that e-bikes, capped at 250W maximum output, simply will not climb even at full power. This is why a cap on overall speed, rather than power — for every device in this category — since it’ll enable manufacturers to at least make sure their vehicles can manage elevation changes. This is a minor issue, but one that’s likely to get lost in the clamoring when uninformed voices get to shout louder than the rest.\nThe UK government doesn’t know how many privately-owned e-scooters are on its roads, but it is starting to collect data about its effects. The Department for Transport published statistics through to the end of 2023, but admitted the numbers aren’t entirely accurate. Still, the trends are obvious: Accident tallies spike each summer, mostly taking place between 4 and 6pm – during the evening rush hour. And young people are being injured in far greater numbers — males between the ages of 10 and 29 make up the majority of those affected. Earlier this year, BBC News reported two children, aged 16 and 9, died as a result of their e-scooter being struck by a car. In short: the lack of regulation hasn't just stunted an environmentally preferable alternative to cars, it seems to also be putting young riders at risk.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/the-uk-needs-to-deal-with-its-e-scooter-problem-133056724.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "It’s obvious that Apple products are some of the most sought-after in the tech world — that means sales are fewer and farther between than other gadgets, and they’re often the first things to sell out when discounts do arrive. But it would be a mistake to assume you’re doomed to always pay full price on things like iPads and Apple Watches. Apple deals to exist, if you know where to look.\nEngadget keeps track of deals like these on a regular basis, so we can help you there. Below, we’ve collected the best Apple deals you can get right now on items like AirPods, MacBooks, iPads and more. Arguably the biggest caveat to note about Apple sales is that you’re almost never going to see discounts directly at Apple.com. Unless you shop refurbished, you’ll always pay top dollar direct at Apple, and for some things (like iPhones), that might be best. But you’ll find more discounts more often if you’re willing to shop at retailers like Amazon, Best Buy, Walmart, Target and others. \nBest AirPods deals\n\n\nAirPods 4 (with ANC) for $119 ($60 off): Apple introduced the fourth generation of its basic earbuds alongside the iPhone 16 last September. This model includes ANC — a first for Apple’s “regular” buds — and Billy awarded them an 86 in his review. Just note they don’t have a fully closed design like the Pro models — but some may prefer the open fit, which Apple completely redesigned to fit more securely.\nAirPods 4 (without ANC) for $89 ($40 off): Apple introduced two models of its fourth generation basic earbuds alongside the iPhone 16 last September. This one doesn't have the extra features of ANC or Transparency Mode (making them cheaper). This pared down model benefits from a shape redesign — which our headphone expert, Billy Steele, found both more comfortable and more secure — as well as improved sound quality that’s more immersive than before.\nBest Apple Watch deals\n\n\nApple Watch SE for $169 (32 percent off): We wouldn’t be surprised to see an update to Apple’s budget smartwatch sometime soon (and we have a few suggestions on the matter). But thanks to some serious discounts, the Apple Watch SE has turned out to be the most affordable way to get an iPhone companion for your wrist. Despite the lackluster screen and limited extra features, it handles the basics well. Also at Best Buy and Walmart.\nBest iPad deals\n\n\nApple iPad Air (M3, 11-inch) for $499 ($100 off): The only major difference between the latest iPad Air and the previous generation is the addition of the faster M3 chip. We awarded the new slab an 89 in our review, appreciating the fact that the M3 chip was about 16 percent faster in benchmark tests than the M2. This is the iPad to get if you want a reasonable amount of productivity out of an iPad that's more affordable than the Pro models. Also at Best Buy and Walmart.\nApple iPad Air (13-inch, M3) for $699 ($100 off): This is Apple’s most affordable large-screen iPad. Engadget’s Nate Ingraham awarded it a review score of 89 upon its debut this March. When you pair it with accessories like a keyboard folio and mouse, it becomes a true productivity machine — though those add-ons make it a pricey package. Good thing iPads are on sale for Prime Day. This $120 discount represents the lowest price we've seen. Also at Best Buy. \niPad Pro (M4, 11-inch) for $915 ($85 off): The most powerful iPad is the iPad Pro, and it’s the one to get if you’re even toying with the idea of using your new slab as a laptop replacement. Both the 11- and 13-inch models have gorgeous displays, thinner and lighter designs, a repositioned front camera and the excessively powerful M4 chip inside. Also at Best Buy. \nBest MacBook deals\n\n\nApple MacBook Air (15-inch, M3, 24GB RAM) for $1,299 ($400 off): The last-gen M3 MacBook Air has officially been discontinued, but it remains a superb laptop while the last bits of stock remain available. We gave this 15-inch model a score of 90 in our review — outside of its slower chip (which is still plenty fast for everyday use), marginally improved camera and inability to power two external displays with the lid open, it's virtually identical to the newer version. This deal requires you to click the on-page coupon and applies to the model with the larger 24GB of memory in the Starlight colorway. \nApple MacBook Air (15-inch, M4) for $1,049 ($150 off): The 15-inch MacBook Air is nearly identical to the smaller version but features more robust speakers and a more spacious trackpad alongside its roomier display. Also at B&H.\nMacBook Air (M3, 15-inch) for $899 ($400 off): The last-gen M3 MacBook Air has officially been discontinued, but it remains a superb laptop while the last bits of stock remain available. We gave this 15-inch model a score of 90 in in our review — outside of its slower chip (which is still plenty fast for everyday use), marginally improved camera and inability to power two external displays with the lid open, it's virtually identical to the newer version.  \nBest Apple accessories deals\n\n\nApple Pencil (USB-C) for $69 ($10 off): This more affordable Apple Pencil doesn’t support pressure sensitivity, but it still makes for a useful stylus for the basics. If you’re a casual note-taker and can live without wireless charging, you’ll save a few bucks by picking this one up. Also available at Walmart.\nApple Pencil (2nd gen) for $90 ($39 off): The Second gen Pencil both attaches and charges magnetically, supports tilt and pressure sensitivity and allows for tool changes with a tap of the flat edge. It’s an older pencil and isn’t compatible with the latest iPad models. This is the lowest price we’ve tracked this year, but it went as low as $80 for last year’s Black Friday sales.\nRead more Apple coverage:\n\nThe best AirPods\nThe best Apple Watches\nThe best MacBooks\nThe best iPhones\nThe best iPads\n\nFollow @EngadgetDeals on X for the latest tech deals and buying advice.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/best-apple-deals-150020110.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "The numbers don’t work out in the average college student’s favor. Most are figuring out how to pay for housing, textbooks, tuition and food — at a time when they may not even be working while attending classes. So anything that can help lessen the outflow of cash is worth considering. Here at Engadget, we’ve tried out our fair share of apps for productivity, creativity and entertainment. The good news for college students is some of those apps are free, or at least have a suitable no-cost version of an otherwise paid service. Here, we’ve rounded up the best free tools and services for college students so you can get work done — and enjoy yourself afterwards — for zero dollars spent.\nGoogle Docs\nEngadget\nYou’re probably going to need a productivity suite at school. Thankfully, the days of having to buy an expensive software bundle are long gone. Google Docs can handle the document creation you’ll need over a semester, whether it’s writing term papers, crunching data in spreadsheets or whipping up group presentations. Automatic cloud saves can spare you the heartache of losing progress.\nYou may want to subscribe to a Google One plan if the free 15GB of Drive storage proves too limiting. And as capable as Docs may be, there may be some classes where professors insist on paid services like Microsoft 365. If you’re free to choose your work tools, however, Docs is an easy choice — particularly if you already rely on Calendar, Meet and other parts of the Google ecosystem. — Jon Fingas, Former Reporter\nFree scanning apps\nCamScanner\nWhether you need to digitize a paper handout from class or snap a shot of your classmate’s written notes, a document scanning app will come in handy. Our previous pick for this category, Evernote Scannable, is sadly no longer free and now goes for $3 a week or $50 for the year. But there are still a couple of mobile document scanner apps that won’t make you pay a monthly fee.\nAdobe Scan and CamScanner offer scaled down versions of their paid services and both work with Apple or Android phones. They let you convert real-world pages into digital PDFs and, of course, they also offer AI-powered features like summarizing and answering questions based on a text — but most AI features are reserved for paid subscribers.\nIn our testing, neither free version was particularly accurate when it came to recognizing characters on the page (OCR) and converting them to digital text. CamScanner performed better and it also offers a Premium text extraction feature for paid subscribers.\nTurns out, the most accurate methods for turning text on paper into copy-and-pastable text were the ones you probably already have on your phone. For iPhone users, the Notes app is a simple but surprisingly accurate way to scan text into a new note. Simply create a new note, tap the Attach (paperclip) icon and select Scan text. You can also scan full documents this way.\nAndroid users can use the free version of Microsoft 365 Copilot, which has a scan function and accurate optical character recognition. The Google Drive app for both iOS and Android also has a scanning function. On the app’s home page, simply tap the camera icon (Android) or the page icon (iOS) and scan the doc you need. Note that iOS users will be able to extract text on their mobile device, while Android users will need to open the PDF they created in a desktop version of Drive or Google Docs.\nThese options may not be as feature-rich as a dedicated scanning app, but if you just need to occasionally upload some real-world text and turn it digital, these may very well be all you need. — Amy Skorheim, Senior Reporter\nTodoist\nEngadget\nStudent life is defined by time management. You’ll likely have to juggle multiple assignments, study sessions and a personal life (remember that?) without missing a beat. Todoist is our pick for keeping yourself on track. You can not only create the usual to-do lists, but set up task boards, set priorities and even delegate items to others — helpful if it’s a roommate’s turn to buy dinner.\nThe free Todoist plan will likely be enough for school with support for five active projects, five collaborators and 5MB file uploads. You’ll only want to shell out $48 per year (or $5 per month) for a Pro account if you have many on-the-go projects (up to 300), need to upload large files or want to set reminder alerts. Whatever you need, this might be key to getting it all done on time. — Jeff Dunn, Senior Reporter\nPhotopea\nPhotopea\nIt used to be that free image editors were underpowered or ungainly, and you could generally forget about web versions. That’s not the case with Photopea, which is more or less an unofficial, online Photoshop clone. Can it fully replace that ultra-popular app? No, it’s slower to process many tasks and it’s missing some of Adobe’s more advanced features. But just about all of the essentials are here, and its web-based interface should immediately feel familiar to anyone who’s used Photoshop before. (It’s much simpler to grok than other free alternatives like GIMP, for one.) For spot heals, crops, light and color touch-ups, background removals, adding text and graphics, layering or most other common edits you might need for a presentation or photography class, it should be enough. It’s compatible with a host of file formats, too, including Photoshop’s PSD, PDF, AI and various RAW camera files. The whole thing is ad-supported by default, with a $5-per-month Premium tier available to remove those and increase online storage from 0.5GB to 5GB. You can also connect to cloud storage services like Google Drive, Microsoft OneDrive and Dropbox. — J.D.\nBlackmagic DaVinci Resolve\nBlackmagic\nYou might not have to pay for a costly video editing package to make it through film school. Blackmagic’s DaVinci Resolve provides an in-depth bundle of editing, color correction, audio and effects tools at no cost. You could make a short film for class using the same core tools used to produce Hollywood blockbusters, complete with multi-user collaboration.\nIn fact, you’ll likely have little need for paid editing products unless your coursework has very specific requirements. You’ll only want to think about spending $295 for DaVinci Resolve Studio if you want to edit footage beyond 4K at 60 frames per second, work with more video formats or rely on advanced 3D, AI and HDR tools. Unless your professors demand that you use a rival tool like Final Cut Pro or Premiere Pro, this should be enough to learn the fundamentals. — J.F.\nBlender\nEngadget\nIf you’re creating 3D artwork for games or videos at school, you’ll want a strong modeling suite — and one of the more capable packages happens to be free. Blender provides a wide range of modeling, animation and sculpting tools for 3D content, while budding movie producers can take advantage of built-in compositing, motion tracking, story art drawing and simple video editing. You might have everything you need to create a CG short film.\nYou’ll want to be sure that Blender can fulfill your class requirements, and you might want more focused software like Natron (an equally free compositing tool) to supplement your work. With that said, Blender’s open source code and extensible design work in its favor. It’s easy to find a bevy of free or low-cost add-ons that can meet your needs, and you can even write your own extensions if you’re comfortable with scripting. — J.F.\nAudacity\nEngadget\nSome courses may need an audio editor, whether it’s to create a podcast, tweak game sound effects or finesse a song. If you’re in that boat, Audacity can sometimes do the trick. The free, open source editor gives you the essentials for capturing and editing multi-track recordings, including support for effects and plugins.\nAudacity won’t replace heavy-duty digital audio workstations like Audition, Logic Pro, Pro Tools or Reason. Those offer non-destructive editing, and often include a slew of effects generators and other tools aimed at music and video production. This is a good place to learn some basics, though, and may well be all you need if a class isn’t particularly demanding. — J.F.\nSpotify\nEngadget\nLet’s be frank: you’re going to need some study music, and Spotify still provides the best free soundtrack for those lengthy learning sessions. The no-charge tier will periodically interrupt your listening with ads, but you can create playlists, follow podcasts and enjoy much of the core Spotify experience. You can stream songs on mobile and smart speakers, too, so the music won’t stop when you leave your desk.\nYou may still want to pay for service, as Spotify’s mobile app makes you listen to all but a handful of playlists in shuffle mode and gives you a limited number of skips per hour unless you use the desktop app. For paid users, Apple Music is the top pick in our guide to the best music streaming services: It offers higher-quality audio (if you have a good set of headphones), a generally cleaner interface and a greater emphasis on curation, with a handful of live radio stations hosted by actual people. It’s reportedly better about paying artists, too, though it’ll work best if you own an iPhone. Mercifully, Apple sells a student plan for $6 per month, the same as Spotify, so you’ll still get a nifty discount. — J.D.\nPDF Candy\nEngadget\nThere’s a distinct possibility you’ll encounter PDF documents at school, whether it’s a research paper or the class syllabus. You won’t have to pay for apps like Adobe Acrobat to edit those files, at least. PDF Candy offers a free web-based editor. You can modify PDFs, convert to and from common formats (including Word and PowerPoint), extract images and otherwise take control. This might do the job if you need to flesh out scanned class notes or extract a quote from a scientific study.\nThere are time and size limits for the free version (up to 500MB per task), and you should also consider the $48 yearly or $99 lifetime plans if you want faster web processing or the Windows app’s offline editing. Alternatives like Acrobat are also better if you need commenting, mobile editing and other advanced features. Still, the free web tool is difficult to beat for basic utilities. — J.F.\nPlex (and other free video streaming services)\nPlex\nThere’s no real way around it: If you want to keep up with the films and shows in the current zeitgeist, you need to pay for a streaming service or two. (Or utilize less scrupulous methods we can’t recommend here.) New apps and price hikes seem to pop up every other week, which sucks for the budget-conscious. Still, there are a number of free services you can use to cobble together some decent entertainment on the cheap, including Plex, Amazon Freevee, Tubi, Pluto TV, The Roku Channel, Crackle, and Sling Freestream, among others.\nAll of these force you to sit through ads, most have pretty sloppy UIs and each is absolutely loaded with trash content. But think of them like the old Blockbuster bargain bin — you may have to do some digging, but every now and then you’ll find a gem.\nWe recommend Plex in the FAST section in our guide to live TV streaming services and it stands out for its search function. Not only can you use it to hunt for shows and movies on its platform, you can also find which other platforms currently carry a particular title. You can also search by actor, genre and more. The addition of movie and show reviews from other Plex users and professional critics makes it a handy — and free —  starting point for your next watch. — J.D and A.S.\nLibby\nLibby\nNot enough people, college students or otherwise, take full advantage of their local library. Libby is an easy way to change that. So long as you have a library card, this clean little app lets you check out ebooks, audiobooks and magazines to your phone, tablet, computer or ereader at no cost. It works across iOS, Android and web browsers, and you can sync your progress between multiple devices. You’re still at the mercy of the selection your library actually has available, and you’ll still have to finish your rentals within a set period. But if you like to read for pleasure between classes, Libby will ensure you never run out of material. — J.D.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/free-stuff-for-college-students-143051840.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "If you’re looking to get healthier without spending a fortune, the best cheap fitness trackers prove you don’t need to splash out on the best smartwatches to stay on top of your goals. Whether you're counting steps, keeping track of heart rate monitoring or trying to improve your sleep patterns, these affordable wearables pack serious health tracking capabilities into wallet-friendly packages.The best budget fitness trackers are perfect for everyday activity tracking, whether you're going for a jog, hitting the gym or just aiming to move a bit more. Many also include extras like support for third-party apps, music control, basic smartphone notifications and wellness insights that help you form better habits over time.No matter your price point, there’s a tracker out there that can help you build a routine, stay motivated and maybe even make fitness fun. We’ve rounded up the top picks that strike the right balance between features, accuracy, and affordability — so you can find the best fitness tracker for your lifestyle, whether you're a total beginner or a casual running watch user looking for something simple.\nTable of contents\n\nBest budget fitness trackers for 2025\nWhat to look for in a cheap fitness tracker\nOther budget fitness trackers we tested\nWhat about fitness rings?\n\nBest budget fitness trackers for 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat to look for in a cheap fitness tracker\nAll of the best fitness trackers should have at least three features: a program for activity tracking, the option to monitor and collect data about your sleep patterns and the ability to do things like heart rate monitoring and blood oxygen level tracking (though, the readings might not be super accurate). Don’t set your sights too high and expect metrics like blood pressure monitoring or ECG support; for that, you’d need to invest in a more expensive fitness watch or wearable like a Samsung Galaxy Watch, which falls under the best smartwatches category and will set you back over $400. \nFitness features\nA cheap workout tracker can be great for someone looking to keep tabs on small, achievable goals like 10,000 steps before sundown or 30 minutes of a HIIT workout to get your heart rate peaking. An experienced long-distance runner looking to train for a triathlon might opt for a more expensive device that can measure cadence or ground contact time, and can track more customizable workouts, offer different sports modes or give deeper insights into performance data.\nAt the very least, a budget workout tracker should be able to offer fitness tracking features beyond walking and running — otherwise, it would just be a pedometer. The number of activities a device will recognize varies. Some will get funky with it and consider skateboarding a workout, while others won’t be able to track a jumping jack.\nAt this price point, you can expect a device to measure a mix of cardio, machine workouts and strength training. With each, you might get a numerical or visual breakdown of heart rate activity, overall pace, and calories burned per session. Although some cheap trackers can offer a really good overview of heart rate zone activity during a workout, a more technically advanced device might be able to go a step further and explain what your results mean and coach you on how to keep your heart rate in a specific bracket so that you can burn more fat per workout. I found that the more budget-friendly the device, the more likely it is that a tracker will fall short when it comes to smart counseling or offering predictive insights beyond a given workout. If a budget tracker does happen to offer some semblance of a coaching program, you can expect it to sit behind a paywall.\nWorkout tracking and planning your recovery is just as essential to any fitness journey. A sub-$100 device should be able to tell you how long you’ve slept and provide a breakdown of deep, light and REM sleep patterns. It's not a guarantee that you will get a sleep “score” or insights on how to get better rest — that data is usually found on more expensive wearables. Also, because these trackers aren’t designed for bedtime specifically — be mindful of comfort. The bands and watch face on a budget fitness watch may not be ideal for getting some good shut-eye.\nConnectivity and practicality\nNot all of the best budget fitness trackers are designed to seamlessly integrate with a smartphone. The trackers tested for this roundup can’t directly make calls or send texts to contacts on a paired iPhone or Android smartphone. They can, however, display and dismiss incoming calls and notifications via a Bluetooth connection. You can forget about checking your email or paying for a coffee from your wrist using these more affordable devices.\nMost cheap fitness trackers also won't include built-in GPS tracking. Instead, they usually depend on a paired smartphone to gather location data. The drawback of using a fitness tracker without GPS is that it might not provide as precise for tracking distance or pace. You also can't use a budget tracker to get turn-by-turn directions during a walk or while running errands. For the more outdoorsy consumers, having GPS could be a key safety feature if you want this kind of functionality at your fingertips.\nDesign\nYou also might find that an inexpensive fitness tracker is harder to navigate than a more advanced smartwatch. Whether it be a screen size issue or simply not having a smart enough interface, don't expect every feature to be one that you can engage with directly on your wrist. You’ll likely need to use your phone to input data or access detailed wellness metrics.\nBuild quality will also vary. While you won’t get premium materials or ultra-bright OLED screens, most best cheap fitness trackers include some level of sweat and water resistance — perfect for everyday wear and casual workouts. And for those starting out with basic gadgets to support their fitness journey, these affordable trackers offer a great balance of essential features without the hefty price tag.\nOther budget fitness trackers we tested\nAmazfit Bip 6\nThe Amazfit Bip 6, an $80 smartwatch from Zepp Health, didn’t quite make the cut. As a fitness tracker, it’s decent, but it’s a frustrating smartwatch substitute. For workouts, the built-in GPS tracks runs and rides without your phone and, combined with the heart rate and blood oxygen sensors, collects a good amount of data to create accurate pictures of your exertion levels, cadence and pace. It’s remarkably lightweight but doesn’t feel cheap and the AMOLED screen is bright and sharp. It’s not an always-on display, but lifting your wrist wakes it reliably.\nThe sleep tracking data is on par with what we measured on other smartwatches and there’s even a daily readiness score that compares your sleep quality and the previous day’s exertion to estimate how physically prepared you are for the day ahead — similar to what Pixel Watches, Fitbit devices and Garmin watches offer. And since the watch battery lasts for over a week on a charge, you may be a lot more apt to wear it to bed than a watch you have to charge daily.\nWe weren’t expecting an $80 device to be a serious Apple Watch challenger, but the Bip 6’s glitches and overly complicated interface (both on the app and on the watch itself) were disappointing. During a week of testing, I got multiple repeated notifications, even after they were deleted, along with suggestions to stand when I was actively doing chores around the house. The watch faces are not customizable, so it was hard to get the info I needed at a glance (the Zepp app has lots of paid watch faces that may have what I wanted, but I didn’t want to pay $3 for something that’s free elsewhere).\nMarketing details state that the Bip 6 can auto-detect workouts, including walking and bike riding. During testing, I walked once or twice per day for over one mile and went on two bike rides, but no workout was ever detected. The watch integrates with Apple Health, so I was able to see how it compares to the data my Apple Watch gathers. After a week of wearing the Bip 6, with no changes to my daily routine, I averaged 400 fewer calories burned and 2.4 fewer miles tracked each day. That was possibly the biggest disappointment of all. — Amy Skorheim, Senior Reporter \nWyze Watch 47c\nI didn't have high expectations of the Wyze Watch 47c, but I was shocked at how little this tracker can do. The 47c can only track walks and runs. It has a dedicated widget, a small logo of a man running, and when you tap it, it begins measuring your pace, heart rate, calories burned and mileage. It does not auto-detect or auto-pause workouts and it doesn't differentiate between a run and walk. Most importantly, this device can’t track any other exercises. It’s basically a glorified pedometer.\nThe 47c was also my least favorite to sleep with, mainly because the square watch face is so large and heavy. Even if I did manage to sleep through the night with it on, it only gave me a basic sleep report. — M.S. \nGarmin vivofit 4\nThe Garmin vivofit 4 has a tiny display that is not a touchscreen and all navigation happens through one button. The watch face is impossible to read outdoors and the exercise widget is also very finicky. To start tracking a run, you have to hold down the main button and flip through some pages until you get to a moving person icon. Once there, you have to press the bottom right corner of the bar and hold down and if you press for too long or in the wrong spot, it’ll switch to another page, like a stopwatch. It’s incredibly frustrating.\nOnce you start a run though, it will start tracking your steps, your distance — and that's pretty much it. It does not auto-detect or auto-pause workouts. It doesn't alert you of any mileage or calorie milestones. — M.S.\nWhat about fitness rings?\nWhile smart rings are gaining popularity for health tracking, they generally don’t fall into the “budget” or “cheap” price range. A smart ring like the Oura Ring offers features such as sleep monitoring, heart rate tracking and readiness scores in an ultra-compact form factor that fits on your finger instead of your wrist. These rings are best suited for people who want discreet, all-day health insights without wearing a traditional watch or band — but with prices typically starting above $300, they’re more of a premium option than a budget-friendly pick.\nGeorgie Peru contributed to this report.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wearables/best-cheap-fitness-trackers-140054780.html?src=rss",
    "full_text": "It may sound basic, but some of the other trackers we tested only report step count and distance traveled after a walk. Plus, it features a generous 18 days of battery life (or more if you enable battery-saver mode). The Amazfit band has a special scoring system called PAI, which stands for “Personal Activity Intelligence.” This metric is derived from your heart rate during all activities (even ones that don't involve tracked workouts) and gives you a numeric score from 1 to 100. Despite having an AMOLED color display, the Band 7’s screen was sometimes hard to view even indoors. Don’t set your sights too high and expect metrics like blood pressure monitoring or ECG support; for that, you’d need to invest in a more expensive fitness watch or wearable like a Samsung Galaxy Watch, which falls under the best smartwatches category and will set you back over $400. An experienced long-distance runner looking to train for a triathlon might opt for a more expensive device that can measure cadence or ground contact time, and can track more customizable workouts, offer different sports modes or give deeper insights into performance data. The drawback of using a fitness tracker without GPS is that it might not provide as precise for tracking distance or pace. For the more outdoorsy consumers, having GPS could be a key safety feature if you want this kind of functionality at your fingertips. You also might find that an inexpensive fitness tracker is harder to navigate than a more advanced smartwatch. And for those starting out with basic gadgets to support their fitness journey, these affordable trackers offer a great balance of essential features without the hefty price tag."
