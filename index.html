											<h3>The Google Pixel 10 and 10 Pro come with magnets, a new chip, and AI everywhere</h3>
											<p>Google has formally announced the Pixel 10, 10 Pro, and 10 Pro XL, and their hardware upgrades can be summed up in two letter/number combinations: G5 and Qi2. Otherwise, there's not much to see on the outside of the phones. They mostly cost the same as last year's devices - $799 for the Pixel 10, […...</p>
